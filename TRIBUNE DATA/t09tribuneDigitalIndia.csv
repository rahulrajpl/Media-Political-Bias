""politicians are under increased scrutiny today. earlier, items, which did not find a place even in gossip columns of newspapers, become breaking news today,"" he said. he also favoured a comprehensive review of the system of government-appointed tribunals to assess their efficacy and effectiveness. committed to scrap obsolete acts, modi said laws are sometimes not drafted well and therefore lead to multiple interpretations. ""there should be minimum grey areas, and therefore, drafting of laws requires special attention,"" he said, adding that though no law an can have ""zero defect"", the grey areas in legislations can be reduced. noting that nearly 1700 redundant laws have been identified for repeal, he said he hopes to repeal one redundant law per day in his tenure.

2015-07-23,manufacturing jobs spiralled during upa regime: study," new delhi, july 22 a research paper by pankaj vashist of the indian council for research on international economic relations (icrier) on the impact of trade liberalisation on jobs shows that the period from 2003-04 to 2011-12 saw the highest increase in manufacturing jobs at 6.83 per cent per annum. this was the period when the upa government led by manmohan singh was in power at the centre for two terms. the research paper argues that during 22 years of post-reform period (1990-2012), increase in labour productivity destroyed more than 11.8 million jobs. while growth in exports created 3.7 million jobs, on the negative side increase in import penetration replaced around 1.4 million jobs. while the trade with oecd countries remained positive and created 1 million jobs, trade with china destroyed more than half a million jobs. the research has analysed the direct as well as indirect impact of trade on jobs in the indian manufacturing sector. using the growth accounting approach, vashist argues that the direct impact of trade on manufacturing jobs was positive. however, trade-induced decrease in labour demand neutralised direct job gains to a great extent. therefore, unlike other asian economies, the overall employment gain from trade remained minimal. ; according to the paper, employment growth recovered in 2003-04 and since then it has been growing at an impressive rate of around 7 per cent per annum. the period covered under the study for this rate is 2004 to 2012. this was the upa government’s tenure which managed strong growth rates in the economy, although the effect of global slowdown had started to hit hard. the upa government was criticised for jobless growth and policy paralysis by the bjp in the 2014 election campaign. the nda government has promised jobs to the youth through its flagship programmes such as make in india, digital india, smart cities and housing for all. sounding a caution for creation of jobs for unskilled labour, the paper argues that the shift in composition of exports suggests that india is increasing the exports of skilled labour intensive products that does not augur well for an unskilled labour abundant country like india. analysis of manufacturing employment in the post-reform period shows that employment growth at an aggregate level did increase. however, it has not shown any consistent trend. employment growth remained respectable during the first half of the 1990s, when it grew at an annual rate of 2.91 per cent per annum. the optimism was short-lived as employment growth turned negative in 1997-98. the downturn became more pronounced in the following years when india removed quantitative restrictions on the imports of consumer goods. from 1997-98 to 2003-04, employment in organised manufacturing sector declined at an annual rate of 1.85 per cent.",manufacturing jobs spiralled upa regime : study,"new delhi , july 22 research paper pankaj vashist indian council research international economic relations ( icrier ) impact trade liberalisation jobs shows period 2003-04 2011-12 saw highest increase manufacturing jobs 6.83 per cent per annum. period upa government led manmohan singh power centre two terms. research paper argues 22 years post-reform period ( 1990-2012 ) , increase labour productivity destroyed 11.8 million jobs. growth exports created 3.7 million jobs , negative side increase import penetration replaced around 1.4 million jobs. while trade oecd countries remained positive created 1 million jobs , trade china destroyed half million jobs. research analysed direct well indirect impact trade jobs indian manufacturing sector. using growth accounting approach , vashist argues direct impact trade manufacturing jobs positive. however , trade-induced decrease labour demand neutralised direct job gains great extent. therefore , unlike asian economies , overall employment gain trade remained minimal. ;

""how many times will you slaughter a chicken? he has repackaged old projects,” kumar told reporters, barely an hour after modi had left the state after announcing the package for state's economic revival. the bonhomie on display in the morning when kumar had gone to receive modi at the airport had vanished as he tore into the prime minister's claims about building a 'naya bihar'. “he talks about cooperative federalism but does exactly the opposite. he will humiliate the state government, call it incompetent... what kind of cooperative federalism is this?"" he said. on pm's remark that kumar had pleaded with the erstwhile upa government for a rs 12,000 crore package and also modi's ""arrogant"" barb against him, the bihar chief minister said, ""he calls me a 'yachak' (supplicant) and an arrogant man at the same time. this is contradictory."" kumar once again trashed modi's bimaru remark to describe bihar. ""bihar government has built 66,500 km roads, over 5,000 bridges, brought down school dropout rate to 1.5 per cent from 12.5 per cent and footfall at primary health centres has gone up to 11,000 every month from mere 39 in 2005,"" he said, rejecting the laggard tag and presenting the picture of a turnaround under his stewardship. rebutting modi's remark that bihar government had failed to expend previous two packages of rs 10,000 crore and rs 12,000 crore provided by the atal bihari vajpayee government and the upa dispensation, kumar said, those were to be implemented by the central agencies and he cannot be faulted for it. ""mr pm perhaps is not aware that works under these packages were to be done by central agencies...so the charge of being laggard should be directed against the central agencies and not the state government,"" he said. claiming that the rs 1.25 lakh crore package was ""no package but merely repackaging of old projects"", kumar gave details of several schemes included in it which had been sanctioned earlier. for building a new airport in patna a sum of rs 2,700 crore has been included in the special package, he said. ""we have been hearing about this for long but no money has been allocated for acquiring 1,500 acres of land needed for new the new airport,"" the cm said, adding ""we can understand what would be the fate of this (package)"". likewise, he said the ultra mega power project at banka for which pm today announced rs 20,000 crore was actually approved when sushil kumar shinde (of congress) was power minister. ""after we had arranged for everything including water, land etc the work did not start and now he has announced it as if it's something new,"" kumar said. the prime minister announced rs 404 crore for digital bihar as part of the special package, kumar said and wanted to know if the state was not part of centre's digital india programme. the chief minister sought to know if budgetary provisions had been made for the projects included in the special package. ""there is no alignment, no dpr of these projects. how can we trust it will be implemented?"" he wondered. ""fifty thousand crore...sixty thousand crore...it looked like as if bihar was being auctioned. auctioning bihar by way of a special package is similar to his earlier promise of depositing rs 15-20 lakh in the accounts of every citizen from the black money that would come to the country from abroad,"" he said. on his criticism by pm for returning the donation received from gujarat for rehabilitation of kosi flood victims, kumar said, ""while giving rs 5 crore the then gujarat cm publicised it in newspapers that gujarat was the biggest donor. many states had made bigger donations but nobody spoke about it."" — pti ","pm announces rs 1.25 lakh cr package poll-bound bihar , targets nitish","arrah/saharsa , august 18 prime minister narendra modi tuesday announced whopping rs 1.25 lakh crore economic package poll-bound bihar , raising stakes high-pitched electoral battle , must-win bjp delhi decimation. conveying sense urgency , modi addressed gatherings two events key hindi heartland state , barely hours arrival two-day visit uae , unleashed scathing attack chief minister nitish kumar , contending lowered bihar ’ prestige pleading previous upa governments package measly rs 12,000 crore. modi also took kumar bihar ’ ‘bimaru ’ tag.your browser support video tag. high point prime minister ' speech announcement much-awaited economic package whopping rs 1.25 lakh crore , contentious issue repeatedly targeted kumar ever since made promise stumping last year ' lok sabha elections. “i today honour promise. said rs 50,000 crore ... much want ? rs 60,000 crore , rs 70,000 crore , 80 90,0000 crore ? announcing package rs 1.25 lakh crore. government delhi spend rs 1.25 lakh crore change bihar ' destiny , ” said enthusiastic crowd lustily cheered , chanting “modi ! modi ! ” . ; said package , whose details disclose , addition ongoing development projects worth rs 40,000 crore already funded centre. devoid leader pan-bihar mass appeal , bjp-led nda chosen bank modi ' charisma wrest bihar jd( u ) , power last one decade , part alliance saffron party. economic package backward state always key issue polls state ' bjp leaders banking announcement , hoping reap rich electoral harvest. addressing event organised ministry transport highways arrah , modi joined issue kumar bihar ' ‘bimaru ’ ( laggard ) tag. chief minister rebutted modi ' claim made rally gaya earlier month bihar still laggard said state ' performance social indices like education healthcare reflected otherwise. bihar cm trashes package patna , chief minister nitish kumar rubbished prime minister narendra modi ' election-eve rs 1.25 lakh crore special package “repackaging old projects ” took branding state bimaru. kumar also assailed modi ' manner announcing economic package , contending looked like "" auction bihar "" .

(also read: ex-coal secy hc gupta, 4 others granted bail) the prime minister, who addressed teachers and students of nine states at an event at the manekshaw auditorium held to mark teacher's day, said teaching was unlike any other occupation. “a teacher can never retire. being a teacher is not like any other occupation. we have to stop becoming robots,” he said. “sometimes people wonder why spend time with students on teachers' day. it is because students are teachers' identity,” said the pm. ; he said his government aimed at providing round-the-clock power to the whole country by 2022, in answer to a question posed by a student on how his government planned to implement its flagship programme digital india when places in india are yet to have power connections. “some 18,000 villages will be electrified in the next 1,000 days,” he said. speaking about the central government’s flagship project, digital indian, he said it was a tool with which the country could be empowered. “we must shift to e-governance to ensure good governance and transparency,” he said. he also elaborated his government’s plan to revamp the country’s existing system of education. the central government plans to substitute character certificates issued by schools with what it calls an aptitude certificate. “everybody gets a character certificate from school. i have issued direction to replace character certificate with aptitude certificate,” said the pm. highlighting the importance of the role of a teacher in shaping lives of students, prime minister narendra modi said: ""students are the identity of a teacher.""

""if a doctor saves someone's life, his photo is published in a newspaper. but if a teacher makes a hundred doctors, he is hardly recognised. teachers' day is to recognise and honour them,"" he said, adding: ""there must have been a great teacher behind every great doctor, engineer, scientist."" observing that a teacher was ""incomplete"" if he did not invest in his students, modi said: ""young children are very impressionable and whatever their teacher says, they'll remember that for the rest of their life. teachers play a big role in shaping students."" he also quoted late former president apj abdul kalam, who, he said ""wanted to be remembered as a teacher"". seeking to give a new dimension to teaching, modi asked doctors, engineers and civil servants and others who have excelled in their fields to devote one hour every week or hundred hours every year to teaching children. ""this would give new strength to teaching in the country,"" he said. in a lighter vein, he remarked that politicians would not make good teachers for that every reason. when a student from goa asked him about his favourite sport, modi quipped: ""we all know the games politicians play."" he went on to narrate how as a youngster in a family with limited means, he did not pursue any dedicated sport but had learnt how to climb trees. on being asked where he got his sense of fashion, modi said: ""i only dress sober and simple"". to a question on leadership, modi said that politics desperately needed good, intelligent people. the prime minister released a commemorative coin in honour of dr sarvepalli radhakrishnan, and also launched the kala utsav website. kala utsav is an initiative of the ministry of human resource development to promote arts in education by nurturing and showcasing the artistic talent of school students at the secondary stage in the country. the prime minister had previously interacted with students on september 5, observed as teachers’ day to mark the birthday of india's second president and scholar dr sarvepalli radhakrishnan, last year. hrd minister smriti irani also spoke to students. — pti",aptitude replace character certificate : modi,"new delhi , september 4 prime minister narendra modi addressed students eve teachers ’ day friday.

india, in the ancient past, had been the front-runner in education and universities like takshila (now in pakistan) and nalanda had been centres of higher learning for students from india and neighbouring countries, mukherjee said. with over 700 universities, including 44 central ones, and around 36,000 colleges, india has one of the largest higher education systems anywhere in the world, he said. “it is equally a matter of concern that till very recently we did not have a single university figuring in the global top 200.” he said it is only now, after concerted efforts and policy interventions, that two of our institutions—iisc bangalore and iit-delhi—broke into the top 200 globally. the need of the hour, therefore, is to focus not only on education per se, but more importantly on quality, he said. the debate becomes even more pertinent when one talks of it in terms of accessibility on the one hand and privatisation and globalisation of higher education, on the other, he noted. “while these measures aim at increasing employability, the emphasis also has to be on providing adequate employment opportunities. growth would be meaningful and inclusive only if it results in improving the standards of the last man, as welfare economists are fond of saying.” india is a young nation and hence it becomes imperative for government and policy makers to come up with policies for achieving growth with job creation, he said. the indian economy has proved its resilience—it has withstood the us financial and eurozone crises, he said. “we need to capitalise on these inherent and intrinsic strengths and create not only more jobs but also an entrepreneurial eco- system,” the president added. the president said the youth today does not wait for opportunities, but creates them. the number of start-ups and their annual turnover are clear indicators in this direction, he said. “we have sundar pichai and satya nadella, rising from the indian education system and heading top global companies (google and microsoft respectively). we need to strive to create such employability for our youth on domestic soil too and this would be the litmus test for our economists and policy planners. “the government’s ‘startup india’, ‘standup india’ programmes aim to do precisely this and i am hopeful that associations like the indian economic association would provide the necessary prescriptive in this area.” the president said, “growth which favours the top deciles or lower proportion of the population can never be sustainable or desirable.” “balancing growth with equity and social justice is a fundamental requirement of our democratic polity. a careful study of not just income disparities but also of their source is required. that is the urgent task for economists to undertake,” mukherjee maintained. on the policy side, the government has launched several programmes such as ‘make in india’, ‘digital india’ and ‘pradhan mantri jan dhan yojana’ to promote financial inclusion and ensure the poor and disadvantaged are not left out of the benefits of economic growth, he added. — pti ",president lays stress quality education,"hyderabad , december 27 president pranab mukherjee sunday stressed imparting quality education promotion skill development called drawing inspiration ancient era india home renowned higher-learning institutes attracted foreign scholars. rued despite vast higher education system , couple indian institutes figured global top 200 recently. “when talk quality education , skill development inherent part it. given population structure , diversity vastness , degree catering ‘one-size-fits-all ’ prescription longer works. “skill development directly related employment prospects youth , therefore , focus providing quality education skill development , ” said. addressing 98th annual conference indian economic association , president said , “when one talks education skill development , feel sense pride look back india ’ history. ” ;

""i want to remind the prime minister of the promises he made to the people of the country during the poll campaign, which modiji does not talk about now and has forgotten. he had also promised that when the bjp government comes to power, it will bring down the prices,"" gandhi said. 'bluster no substitute of statistics' after gandhi attacked the prime minister, jaitley contended that the nda government had inherited high inflation from the upa dispensation. “any form of bluster is not substitute of statistics,"" he told the congress vice-president while intervening in a debate on price rise and asked him to compare the status of inflation during the upa government and that prevailing now. referring to gandhi's attack on modi for criticising the then congress-led government over inflation in february 2014, jaitley said, “this is a topic of statistics and not sloganeering. the upa had left government in a serious state and it is but natural that any contesting candidate before election would say that if i come to power, i will try to bring inflation down. no one should have any objection to that."" insisting that the modi government had reduced inflation and kept it under control, the finance minister said he expects it to reduce further with a ""good"" monsoon. he acknowledged that high prices of pulses is a concern and said steps are being taken to address this by narrowing the mismatch between demand and supply. noting that india has the highest production along with highest consumption of pulses, he said while the demand is for 23 million tonnes, the production was 17 million tonnes, leaving a gap of six million tonnes. the output of pulses is expected to go up to 20 million tonnes this crop year, jaitley said, adding steps are also being taken by the food ministry to create a buffer of 20 lakh tonnes of pulses to keep the prices under control. he also criticised gandhi for asking the prime minister to set a date by when the prices will come down, saying issues are settled through policies rather than giving dates. the government is working on policies to encourage farmers to produce more and india is moving towards self sufficiency in pulses produce, he said. ""you are talking about a government which left behind double digit inflation and today we have a situation where steps have been taken in each sector to contain inflation. any form of bluster is not a substitute for statistics. these are backed by hard facts,"" jaitley said. jaitley said the monthly statistics shows the pulses inflation is coming down and asked rahul gandhi not to look for corruption angle in the rise of prices of pulses, which he said occurred due to rise in costs globally besides two consecutive years of drought. ""even today the corruption scandals that emerge are those of upas and not nda... we have contained inflation despite having two years of drought,"" jaitley said. he said the upa had left the economy in a dire state, with consumer price index (cpi) and food inflation at double digit, wpi inflation around 6-7 per cent and growth prospects were limited. he cautioned upa against indulging in ""back of envelop calculations"" regarding economic data stating it will only be ""misleading"". taking a jibe at gandhi for quoting market prices of essential commodities, jaitley said in a lighter vein, ""everybody in this house seems to be claiming to go to market everyday"". he said in 2012-13 and 2013-14, which were the last two years of the upa regime, were marked by increasing prices and inflation data looked grim. the nda government has brought down inflation and for 18 straight months, the country has witnessed negative wpi inflation, the finance minister said. — pti ",jaitley hits back rahul ’ ‘arhar modi ’ jibe price rise,"new delhi , july 28 hitting back rahul gandhi ‘arhar modi ’ salvo , finance minister arun jaitley thursday reeled statistics lok sabha assert nda government brought inflation expressed hope prices essential commodities come "" good "" monsoon. earlier , launching scathing attack prime minister narendra modi failing control dal prices , congress vice-president rahul gandhi said , “there new slogan becoming popular villages , ‘arhar modi , arhar modi , arhar modi. ” ( follow tribune facebook ; twitter @thetribunechd ) reference bjp slogan ' har har modi ' used lok sabha polls , said "" people saying ' arhar modi ' .

(follow the tribune on facebook; and twitter @thetribunechd) ; the president also made it clear that democracy was not just about exercising choice to elect government periodically. in his address to the nation on the eve of india's 70th independence day -- his fifth since assuming office, the president asked authorities and institutions of state power to adhere to the ""maryada"" (dignity) in discharge of their duties as established in this ancient indian ethos. ""in these four years, i also saw with, some disquiet, forces of divisiveness and intolerance trying to raise their ugly head. attacks on weaker sections that militate against our national ethos are aberrations that need to be dealt with firmly,"" he said. the president said the collective wisdom of our society and our polity gave him the confidence that such forces will remain marginalised and india's remarkable growth story will continue uninterrupted. prez cautions against divisive political agenda ""the great tree of liberty requires constant nourishment through the institutions of democracy. disruptions, obstructionism and unmindful pursuit of a divisive political agenda by groups and individuals lead to nothing but institutional travesty and constitutional subversion. polarising debates only deepen the fault lines in public discourse,"" he said. mukherjee said the constitution has clearly defined the duties and responsibilities of every organ of the state. ""it has established the ancient indian ethos of ""maryada"" as far as authorities and institutions of state power are concerned. the spirit of the constitution has to be upheld by adherence to this ""maryada"" by the functionaries in the discharge of their duties,"" he said. the president said india will grow, only when all of india grows.

2017-06-04,"isro’s gsat-19, 11 satellites: game changers in communications","new delhi, june 4 isro’s upcoming endeavours — the gsat-19 and the gsat-11 satellites — are potential game changers and can revolutionise communications by empowering a digital india and providing internet services and streaming like never before. (follow the tribune on facebook; and twitter @thetribunechd) isro is undertaking a mega experiment at india’s rocket port at sriharikota: a spanking new monster rocket is all set to launch an altogether new class of communications satellite. tapan misra, director of the space applications centre, ahmedabad, where the gsat-19 satellite has been designed, calls it “a game changer communications satellite for india”. ; if it succeeds, the single gsat-19 satellite will be equivalent to having a constellation of 6-7 of the older variety of communication satellites in space. today out of a constellation of 41 in-orbit indian satellites, 13 are communication satellites. “a truly ‘made in india’ satellite that will empower a digital india that is in the making,” says misra of gsat-19. india’s heaviest rocket till date, the geosynchronous satellite launch vehicle mark-iii (gslv mk-iii) that weighs equivalent to the weight of five fully-loaded boeing jumbo jets or as much as 200 fully grown elephants is attracting all the attention! this is india’s rocket of the future as it will undoubtedly be human rated to carry indian astronauts likely to be named ‘gaganauts or vyomanauts’. former isro chairman k kasturirangan, the man who conceived the gslv mk-iii, confirms it will be india’s vehicle to ferry indians into space. on this maiden mission, the gsat-19 satellite this monster rocket will ferry is in a technological class that has no parallels in the country. the satellite weighing 3,136 kg is equal to the weight of a single elephant being lofted into space, but this novel satellite promises not to be a ‘white elephant in space’. as space experts say rockets are like taxis, it is the passenger who is more important and hence in this forthcoming launch even though all eyes are on the gslv mk-iii, the real focus should be on the unique passenger which is as misra emphasises “the country’s first satellite capable of providing internet services using a space based platform”. internet services may not be unleashed immediately but what the country is putting together is a capability in place which is very important especially to connect places that are literally off the fibre optic internet backbone. at over 3 tons, the gsat-19 satellite will the heaviest satellite made and to be launched from india and is a voluminous animal. misra says “by volume it is the most enormous satellite made by india”. the satellite is indeed a test bed for many new technologies. gsat-19 is going to be powered for the first time with indigenously-made lithium-ion batteries. these batteries have been made so that india’s self-reliance quotient can increase. in addition, similar batteries can then be used to power electric vehicles like cars and buses. according to isro, the gsat-19 “carries a geostationary radiation spectrometer (grasp) payload to monitor and study the nature of charged particles and the influence of space radiation on satellites and their electronic components”. an important experiment to understand how to make space- based components more radiation resistant. isro says gsat-19 also features certain advanced spacecraft technologies including “miniaturised heat pipe, fibre optic gyro, micro electro-mechanical systems (mems) accelerometer”. these are all important developments being tested so that they become mainstay systems on future missions. the most innovative development on gsat-19 is that for the first time there will be no transponders on the satellite. in fact, the word ‘transponder’ will not be associated with this new bird in the sky, says misra. instead for the first time, isro is using a whole new way beaming data down using multiple frequency beams and hence it is dubbed “a high through put satellite”. misra explains that earlier the entire country was lighted with a single beam that meant all users had to share the same band width, with the new suite of technologies on- board gsat-19 it has 8 beams so that data can be pumped down in much higher capacities. almost 6-7 times more data can be beamed down. gsat-19 is a fore-runner for the technologies that isro seeks to unleash on the country. in fact scientists at isro suggest that gsat-19 is just a trailer, the real movie which is the gsat-11 satellite will go up in a few months and that is a mighty communications platform. the gsat-11 weighs a whopping 5.8 tons and since india still does not possess a space truck big enough to send it in orbit hence it will be launched using the ariane-5 rocket from kourou in south america. don’t get confused by the numbering, in isro’s space-time warp sometimes the younger brother can get married before the older brother hence gsat-19 is lifting off before gsat-11. the gsat-11 is a mega satellite whose panels are the biggest india has ever made at over 4 metre in height, in addition this giant bird will have effectively 32 beams streaming data like never before. “it is not a single satellite but like a constellation of many satellites all working from a single platform and in unison from the sky,” misra says. once this satellite hits the orbit satellite-based internet streaming will become a total reality for india, he says. in the ever-changing cyber security environment, india urgently needs an all new internet backbone since new delhi just can’t rely on optical fibres, copper based telephony and mobile cellular services as an alternative. today satellite-based internet services are a robust and secure form of communication. “for a vast country like india, satellite-based communication where voice, data and streaming video all combine on a single platform holds immense potential,” misra says. india is today muscling its way into the big boys club of space fairing. isro chairman a s kiran kumar says it is a huge experiment with an all new vehicle and an all new satellite. pti ","isro ’ gsat-19 , 11 satellites : game changers

india, she said, has displayed the courage and leadership to take tough decisions which have launched the interlinked process of sustainable development. swaraj said the complete eradication of poverty is the most important priority of the present government. “there are two ways of addressing the curse of poverty. “the traditional method is through incremental levels of aid and hand-holding,” she noted. “but our prime minister narendra modi has chosen the more radical route, through economic empowerment. the poor are not helpless; we have merely denied them opportunity. we are eliminating poverty by investing in the poor. we are turning them from job-seekers into job-providers,” swaraj said. she said that all of the economic programmes—jan dhan, mudra, ujjwala, skill india, digital india, clean india, start-up india and stand-up india—have a principal purpose, the empowerment of the poor. “the jan dhan plan must surely count as the world’s largest financial inclusion scheme,” she said, adding that at least 300 million indians who had never crossed the doors of a bank today have bank accounts: this is equivalent to the population of the united states of america. “this was, understandably, not easy to complete in three years, but our banks, achieved this visionary goal set by our prime minister. while some remain to be included, the target has been set – every indian family will have a bank account,” she said, adding that these accounts were opened with zero balance. mudra yojana, she said, has enabled government to fund the unfunded. “those who had never dreamt that bank credit was within their options, today, through mudra, are getting soft loans without collateral to begin micro businesses,” she said. she said that over 70 per cent of these loans have gone to women. describing ujjwala a signature scheme of the government, swaraj said free gas cylinders are being provided to the poor so that women do not have to suffer the dangerous consequences of wood-fired kitchens. she said india has started, this year, the india-un development partnership fund, asserting that the country is completely engaged in fighting poverty. pti ",demonetisation courageous decision challenge black money : swaraj,"united nations , september 23 external affairs minister sushma swaraj saturday said demonetisation “courageous ” decision taken prime minister narendra modi challenge black money — one by-products corruption. prime minister modi november 8 , 2016 , demonetised rs 500 rs 1,000 notes bid clamp black money , fake currency menace , terror funding corruption. “demonetisation courageous decision challenge one by-products corruption , ‘black money ’ disappeared circulation , ” swaraj said address 72nd session united nations general assembly here. also said india passed goods services tax ( gst ) legislation , one tax across country , without untidy punishing system multiple taxes differing categories different parts india. “our ‘save girl , educate girl ’ campaign reducing gender inequality. clean india programme generating described revolutionary change social attitudes habits , ” said. ;

""last november, december and january, stalwarts made speeches in the parliament. if you haven't heard them, hear them. these stalwarts who see themselves as ""tees maar khan"", those who think themselves as the epitome of knowledge, used to say that in india there is poverty, lack of education, how can digital transaction work,"" modi said. ; they also wondered how people could go cashless, he said.

(follow the tribune on facebook; and twitter @thetribunechd) the quest for an open and accessible internet, he said, often leads to vulnerabilities like cyber attacks, and a major focus area should be training of well-equipped professionals to counter cyber threats. addressing the global conference on cyber space here, he said internet, by nature, is inclusive, but the quest for an open and accessible internet often leads to vulnerability like cyber attacks. ; “stories of hacking and defacement of websites are the tip of an iceberg. they suggest that cyber attacks are a significant threat, especially in the democratic world. “we need to ensure that vulnerable sections of our society do not fall prey to the evil designs of cyber criminals. alertness towards cyber security concerns should become a way of life,” the prime minister cautioned. global cyber attacks in may-june this year infected more than 3,00,000 computers, disrupting work at banks and multinational firms and shutting down port operations. stating that ‘hacking’ may have acquired an exciting, even if dubious, overtone, he said cyber warriors need to be trained and well equipped to take on cyber threats. “we need to ensure that cyber protection becomes an attractive and viable career option for the youth,” modi suggested. the prime minister put the onus on countries to take responsibility to ensure the digital space does not become a playground for “the dark forces of terrorism and radicalisation”. “information sharing and coordination among security agencies is essential to counter the ever-changing threat landscape,” he said. “surely, we can walk the fine balance between privacy and openness on the one hand and national security on the other.” the differences between global and open systems, and nation-specific legal requirements can be overcome, he stressed. according to modi, while emerging digital technologies could impact the future, important questions of transparency, privacy, trust and security may need to be addressed. modi further said his government has used the trinity of bank accounts, mobile phones and biometric identification number aadhaar to better target subsidies and prevented leakages of nearly usd 10 billion so far. digital technology has become a great facilitator, giving farmers access to expert advice and good price, enabled small entrepreneurs to supply goods to the government, removed the requirement of pensioners to present themselves before the bank officer and given women jobs, he said. “we shall be happy to share our experiences and success stories with the global community,” modi added, inviting the global community to invest in indian startups. he went on to say cyberspace has transformed the world over the last few decades and digital technology today has emerged as a great enabler. “it has paved the way for efficient service delivery and governance. it is improving access, in domains from education to health. and it is helping shape the future of business and economy,” the prime minister emphasised. “technology breaks barriers.” he made the point that digital technology provides the less-privileged sections of society a more level-playing field and on a macro-scale has contributed to emergence of a flat world, where a developing nation like india can compete on a level footing with developed nations. modi termed the government’s ‘digital india’ initiative as the world’s largest, technology-led transformative programme. pti",modi pitches sharing info among nations counter cyber threat,"new delhi , november 23 prime minister narendra modi thursday made pitch information sharing coordination among nations fight threat digital space becoming “playground ” terrorism radicalisation , saying fine balance struck privacy national security.
