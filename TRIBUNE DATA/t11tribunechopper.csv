links among tyagi, his brothers, khaitan and company and middleman, through whom the bribe was routed to india. the cbi is also looking into tyagi's international visits after his retirement and his bank accounts and assets. khaitan claimed that during questioning he admitted to having set up ids tunisia, which sources say is a subsidiary of ids india, one of the companies through which the alleged bribe was routed by agustawestland middlemen to other countries. khaitan was confronted with records of the companies that he allegedly had set-up before 2010. meanwhile, the cbi conducted

paying bribes. the cbi had registered a case against tyagi along with 13 others including his cousins and european middlemen. tyagi's name cropped at various points in the said judgement. the

2016-05-06,sonia gandhi’s lioness: jyotiraditya scindia,"aditi tandon  new delhi, may 6 before walking out of the lok sabha in the super heated agustawestland vvip chopper deal debate on friday, the congress mounted a dramatic defence for party chief sonia gandhi, whom the bjp government is mentioning for alleged role in the multi-crore deal.

""even the judge who recently convicted two bribe takers in the issue said there was no evidence against sonia gandhi and that she has been mentioned in the matter only as someone who will fly in the vvip chopper in question. even ap, which bjp is describing as ahmed patel, has been so mentioned in unsigned noting based on internet search for what ap stands for. you should be ashamed of targeting our leaders based on such unsubstantiated noting, "" scindia said in a debate that saw congress members clash repeatedly with defence minister manohar parrikar and member anurag thakur on whose calling attention notice the discussion was undertaken. congress attempted to allege that bjp government did nothing much to punish guilty in the case and was only interested in making political capital. scindia questioned parrikar on why the ruling dispensation is allowing agustawestland's parent firm in sub contracts in india when agusta stands blacklisted from july 2014. he further asked why bjp opposed a jpc probe in the case when the then upa government had offered one. the party however did not wait to get responses from parrikar, who later answered every query scindia raised, asking him of it would have been wise to compromise national security by banning finmeccanica from supplying critical sub parts and components for naval ships and other defence equipment.

2016-05-06,upa govt did everything to help agusta: parrikar,"new delhi, may 6 mounting attack on the congress, the central government on friday said the previous upa government had “done everything” to help agustawestland bag the vvip chopper contract and asserted that it would track down the main beneficiaries of the kickbacks in the deal. in a hard-hitting speech in the lok sabha, defence minister manohar parrikar said the “entire corruption” in the deal took place during the upa tenure but former air chief s.p. tyagi and gautam khaitan are “small people” who “simply washed their hands in a flowing ganga (of corruption)” and that the government will “find out where the river was going”. he said while the decision on the contract was taken in 2010, tyagi had retired in 2007 and “might have got just a ‘chiller’ (loose change)”. amid a walkout by the congress, which was pressing for a supreme court-monitored probe, he said the cbi is “very seriously” investigating the case. ; “i hope members are satisfied and they will support the government in finding the truth. the truth may lead to many unwanted realism. what we could not do in bofors, may be we will do it in agustawestland,” parrikar said while replying to a debate on the calling attention motion during which he continuously targeted the congress but deliberately refrained from naming anybody. he said the upa government had “done everything” to help agustawestland bag the rs 3,600 crore deal for purchase of 12 vvip helicopters and that its action against the company following the disclosure of corruption was not pro-active but “forced by circumstances”. he asserted that the government will recover damages to the tune of 398 million euros as well as the “bribe”. referring to the italian court’s recent judgment, parrikar said with this, the criminal conspiracy has been established and “we will get the documents very fast”. alleging that the congress had close links with christian michel, the middleman in the deal, he said the contract was given to a company which had not even participated in the tendering process. finding loopholes in the deal, the defence minister said the tender was submitted by italy-based agustawestland but the contract was given to the uk-based agusta westland international ltd (awil), which was not original equipment manufacturer (oem). “i am shocked, how could you accept order from a company who has not given tender? they lost sense of proportion. they thought they will be in power for ever. the smell and sight of euro was so attractive, so intoxicating that they forgot everything. they should take consultation from michel on how to cover up and how to do white wash,” he said taking a dig at the congress. as the congress created uproar and tried to disrupt his speech, he remarked, “why are you (congress) concerned? i have not named anybody. you seem to know where the ganga was going.” “an investigation is underway with regard to those who washed hands in the flowing ganga. those who wash hands in the ganga have an idea about temperature of the water, how fast the water is flowing. based on that, we are assessing whether water was cold or hot, whether the water had hindi, english, italian or german and what was the issue,” parrikar said. refusing to spell out what the cbi probe had revealed, the defence minister told the house, “i can assure you that i will not disappoint you.” he said he has already started personally “monitoring” the probe even though the cbi and ed are not under him. “i am personally taking interest into the sequence of events,” he said. when cpi(m) member mohd saleem questioned how he could “monitor” the cbi and whether it was not affecting its independence, the minister amended his version to say that he was not telling the cbi what to do but only “trying to find out what they are doing” and “monitoring its progress” to check if they are doing something. he asserted that it was within his right as otherwise he would not be able to inform the house about the progress of the probe. parrikar, while giving details of the case, said the decision to prescribe higher cabin height of 1.8 metres of the helicopter was taken by the upa government on may 9, 2005, and to buttress his point, he placed on the table of the house the minutes of the meeting that was chaired by the then nsa m.k. narayanan. noting that the scam surfaced in 2012, the defence minister said nothing was done by the then upa government till january 2014. describing the then defence minister ak antony as “bechara” (helpless), parrikar contended that his “hands were tied” and he took no action as he “feared that his sainthood would be disrobed”. he said antony acted only after a top official of finmeccanica, the parent company of agustawestland, was arrested in italy in connection with bribery in the deal. soon after the arrest, antony gave the files to cbi in 2-3 hours, he said, adding “he (antony) wanted to protect his image.... whether he knew or didn’t know, i don’t know.” responding to congress contention that the italian judge had said that there was no evidence against sonia gandhi, parrikar said it was half-truth as the judge had said that it was for india to investigate and for its investigating agencies to “prove the guilt of people who are suspected”. with regard to the congress charge that the modi government had allowed an agustawestland affiliate to participate in another tender despite the company being blacklisted, the defence minister said the firm had only put on website its request for information (rfi) which anybody can do in a digital world. “any person who wants can put his own information there. “now it is on open interent and if anyone wants to put information, whether it is (congress leader) jyotiraditya scindia, or christian michel or agusta westland, we cannot stop him,” he said. he then took a dig at the congress, saying they seemed to know every action of agustawestland. he said he was not aware that the company had uploaded something on the website and he looked for it only after the congress raised the issue. “so on rfi, if someone has put it, i didn’t know. it came to my notice, when these people (congress) raised it. so with these (company) people, how much close relation they share, it comes to our mind. i didn’t know about it that they have loaded information on rfi,” parrikar said. suggesting conspiracy to eliminate evidence in the deal, he referred to a “mysterious” fire incident on july 3, 2014, in the air force headquarters here and said he would be asking the cbi to probe that. he said all files were burnt in that fire but luckily three files related to the agustawestland deal were saved as those had been kept by an official in his locked drawer. “if it was in somebody’s mind to set it on fire, we think that failed as the official who was there because the agusta issue was sensitive. he had locked the files in his drawer. so three files were saved and the three files related to aw-101 helicopters,” the defence minister said. — pti ",upa govt everything help agusta : parrikar,"new delhi , may 6

the italian government completed investigation, filed the cases in court, judgment came and those who were involved in paying bribe were sent to jail.” “when anna agitation started, people wanted to change the government... they knew that both congress and bjp are two sides of the same coin, but modi ji gave such wonderful speeches before lok sabha poll that people’s hopes were build that corruption will end,” kejriwal said. noting that during the poll campaigns, modi said that he will take action against congress president’s son-in-law robert vadra for alleged irregularities in the land deal, but despite being in power for two years, and having state governments in haryana and rajasthan, he (vadra) hasn’t been interrogated even once. “modi had said that the corrupt will be sent to jail. it has been two years and not a single person has been sent to jail...the country has been cheated and hence we had to again gather against their ‘alliance’ four years after we had gathered at the same place to protest the corruption of these two parties,” he said. kejriwal said while the cbi raided his office, it could not even interrogate vadra. “they got a cbi raid conducted on me but could not get anything beyond four mufflers in a day-long raid. but there is no raid on sonia gandhi. why is modi scared of her? before elections he used to say vadra is congress’ son-in-law, now it looks like even modi has adopted him. “the papers of his (vadra) land scam are lying in rajasthan. they have government in haryana, rajasthan and the centre. what are they waiting for? why is there no action against him? the cbi hasn’t called him even once because modi doesn’t have courage. “you arrest her, interrogate her for two days, the truth will come out automatically. “amit shah says sonia ji please you tell us who all took bribe. manohar parrikar says sonia ji you please tell who all have taken bribe. is any interrogation conducted like this? if you would have told earlier that you both (congress and bjp) were hand in glove, nobody would have voted for you,” kejriwal said. he said that both parties possessed “secrets” of each other and claimed that the details of modi’s degrees were given to them by congress leaders from gujarat, who were not “permitted” to raise the issue earlier by the gandhi family. “there is a very good setting. modi has assured the congress that he will just abuse them but not arrest gandhi in the agusta case and sonia gandhi has assured him that his degree’s issue will not be raised by the congress. “the upa was in power for 10 years and during those years they have kept secrets of modi’s all scams. modi knows that if gandhi is arrested, vadra is arrested, his secrets will also be in public domain,” he said. again raising the degree issue, kejriwal said the country will continue to respect him if he accepted that his degree was “fake”, but people will not tolerate fraud and forged degrees. he said his party mlas were arrested over trivial issues and demanded that modi should also be treated like former delhi law minister jitendra singh tomar, who was arrested in an alleged fake degree row. “his one such secret is his degree. he said in his affidavit that he did ba from du and ma from gujarat. i am not saying you need to be educated to be a prime minister, people without degrees can also be talented.... if he is 12th pass, we have no issues... if he says that the country would still respect him... but if he does cheating and fraud, forged degrees, country will not tolerate,” he said. — pti","agusta case : kejriwal jumps fray , says modi lacks courage arrest sonia","new delhi , may 7 launching scathing attack modi government congress agustawestland chopper scam , delhi chief minister arvind kejriwal saturday said prime minister “enough courage ” arrest sonia gandhi two parties “alliance corruption ” . read : aap takes protest march , 300 detained guilty ’ spared , ‘first last family ’ : parrikar questioning congress issue prime minister ’ alleged “fake ” degree , kejriwal also said two parties “setting ” bjp government arrest gandhi chopper scam congress raise matter modi ’ educational qualification. “the italian court order also names sonia gandhi , ahmed patel , certain officers congressmen , modi able gather enough courage arrest sonia gandhi , ask even two questions , interrogate ... ; “modi ji made prime minister take action leave task italy court ... chest would also 56 inch would sent jail ... prime minister says italy ’ court taking gandhi ’ name .... want ask modiji scared ?

“the world in one voice is praising india’s role. pakistan is finding it difficult to answer. the world is watching. earlier, the world would not buy india’s theory on terrorism and sometimes it would even treat terrorism as a law and order problem. now, the whole world is accepting what india says on terrorism. it is accepting the loss caused to india by terrorism, the loss caused to humanity by terrorism. i believe india will have to continue putting forth its view on this matter,” the pm said. on china objecting to india’s entry into nuclear suppliers group (nsg), modi exuded confidence that the country would get membership of the bloc and the process for it has begun on a “positive note”. modi said india had a number of problems with china and efforts were on to resolve them one-by-one through talks. asked during an interview whether he was disappointed as china blocked india’s bid for membership of the nsg and how close it was to getting it, modi only said things would move forward as per rules. the pm said successive governments had made consistent efforts for getting membership of the un security council, shanghai cooperation organisation (sco), missile technology control regime (mtcr) and nsg. “first thing is that india has taken up such efforts consistently whichever government was in power — be it membership of un security council, sco or mtcr or nsg. all of us made efforts.” “it is not only this government which has done this. this is in continuity. it is true that in our tenure, sco has been achieved, mtcr membership has been achieved. i am fully confident that we have begun efforts in the direction of the nsg (membership), formally.” “the process has begun on a positive note. everything is governed by its own rules. things will move forward as per rules,” he said. “we do not have one problem with china, we have many problems pending with china. slowly and steadily efforts are on to find solutions to them one-by-one,"" he said. — pti modi speaks his mind on issues facing nation, bjp bjp hotheadss “heroes should not be made out of hotheads who make extreme comments… the media should also exercise self-restraint while dealing with such people. i see news channels airing statements made by people whose faces i have never seen and they end up hogging the limelight... i fail to understand why such people are encouraged. don't make them heroes, they will themselves stop” agusta probes“there is no witch-hunt in the probe into the agustawestland chopper deal. investigating agencies will do a professional job and whatever names come up, let’s see. a sin has been committed and those behind it have had a major protective cover. i can’t deny it and i believe that we have the right to doubt that people behind this are very experienced” foreign policys“the biggest factor that has empowered this foreign policy is that for 30 years, we have had unstable governments without a clear mandate. the world measures a government by the situation it is in its own country. i am thankful to the people of this country that they elected this government with full majority and this has had an impact on world politics” inflations“you can’t view inflation as an issue of perception. price rise should be seen as a reality. we will have to accept reality. the fast rate at which inflation was rising under the previous government has decelerated a lot. you can check the statistics, you will find it all” povertys “the poor are the focus of my government’s economic agenda. the poor should be strengthened in such a way that they get the willingness to defeat poverty. by helping the poor make ends meet while they remain in poverty is also one of the ways. i am not saying right or wrong, but it’s one of the ways” regrets humourless public life pm modi regretted that humour had more or less disappeared from public life as newsmakers feared being misunderstood. he said he earlier used to pepper his speeches with anecdotes laced with humour. but he was now afraid of doing that. “now i fear... it is a matter of concern,” he said",need alert time pak : pm,"new delhi , june 27having taken risky initiatives , prime minister narendra modi today said india would “alert conscious ” times wondered pakistan lines drawn conducting talks — elected government “other actors ” . said india would drive home advantage fact world convinced views terrorism across border. india continue putting forth views matter , modi said. “with pakistan draw ‘lakshman rekha ’ talks — elected government actors ? india alert conscious times. laxity negligence , ” told news channel. modi asked define “lakshman rekha ” holding talks pakistan. 2014 , government said talks two countries hurriyat. pm said longer convince world india ’ stand terrorism. made consistent efforts neighbour given lahore visit inviting pakistan prime minister india , modi said. ;
