""thus if in the light of the aforesaid documents recovered, the subsequent meetings which kumar mangalam birla had initially with the prime minister and thereafter with p c parakh or with dasari narayan rao (the then minister of state for coal and mines) are seen coupled with the two letters dated may 7, 2005 and june 17, 2005 written by him to the prime minister requesting for allocation of talabira-ii coal block, then it is found that a concerted effort was being made to manipulate the entire government machinery so as to protect the interest of m/s hindalco,"" the court said. it, however, clarified that there cannot be any objection if the head of a leading industrial house met the prime minister or other top officials ""but when such meetings are seen in the over all facts and circumstances as mentioned above coupled with the follow up action which resulted at the administrative level in the government then it certainly raises eye brows."" it also said that in the final report submitted by cbi, it was stated that even the reasons mentioned by birla to parakh for accommodating hindalco in allotment of talabira-ii coal block which were reproduced by parakh in one of his notes in august 2005, were ""found to be not correct"". while directing cbi to question manmohan singh and others, the court observed that members of the screening committee and ministry of coal, including the ministers heading it, were acting as trustees of important nationalised natural resources of the country. ""in a democratic society, it is incumbent on such persons having dominion over the nationalised natural resources of the country to ensure that the said resources are handled and distributed in an objective and transparent manner with equal opportunities to one and all. with the aforesaid directions, i am accordingly sending the matter back to cbi for further investigation,"" the judge said. referring to the documents placed before it by the cbi, the court observed that certain ""loose ends"" were required to be tied up first so that a ""clear and comprehensive picture"" may come up on the record. ""there are certain circumstances which need to be elaborated/explained especially as regard the manner and the circumstances under which the matter was taken up in pmo or under what circumstances recommendations of the 25th screening committee (in which hindalco was not considered favourable for allocation of talabira-ii block) were set aside even though it already stood approved,"" it said. the judge also said that it was needed to be clarified as to under what circumstances the settled procedure of making allocation of various coal blocks through screening committee route was ""not adhered to"" in this matter. in its order, the court also referred to an august 17, 2005 letter written by orissa's chief minister naveen patnaik requesting the then prime minister to provide required coal linkage to important project of hindalco. the court, however, clarified that it was not questioning the discretion vested either with the screening committee or the prime minister as minister of coal but it was primarily the manner in which ""this discretion has been exercised which is subject to judicial review."" ""the moot question to be examined is as to whether the procedure laid down as per law or the guidelines earlier framed were duly followed in the entire process of allocation of coal block to hindalco or not. it also needs to be seen as to under what circumstances a deviance from the settled rules/ regulations or the guidelines laid down was effected,"" it noted. ""whether the entire matter was dealt with at all levels in an objective manner or the subjectivity prevailed so much that the objectivity or the rule of law lost its relevance in the entire process completely,"" the judge observed. detailing the probe done by the cbi, the court said that during the search conducted at the office of m/s aditya birla management corporation pvt ltd in new delhi, not only a huge sum of rs 25,01,41,100 was recovered but certain letters written by subendu amitabh, its group executive president, to hindalco's md were also recovered. it said that during the probe, cbi recorded statements of a number of officers of the ministry of coal and the pmo while birla and various officers of the aditya birla group were also examined. in its order, the court said after birla wrote a letter to manmohan singh on may 7, 2005, a report from the ministry of coal was sought and when no response was received, repeated reminders were sent to the ministry to expedite their reply. it said that birla's second letter of june 17, 2005 to the prime minister was also followed up in ""right earnest"" by the officers of pmo. ""i may also again mention that there may not be anything abnormal or wrong if any such letter is forwarded by the pmo to the concerned ministry for necessary action or a report is called for but if in the overall facts and circumstances as discussed above the number of reminders which were sent by the pmo as well as repeated telephonic requests seeking an early response from the moc are seen then entire process raises grave shadows of suspicion,"" the judge said. the court said despite the fact that the matter relating to allocation of talabira-ii coal block was already dealt with earlier, the issue was sought to be ""re-opened"" pursuant to the two letters written by birla to manmohan singh. it said when moc's then section officer premraj kuar had observed that it would not be possible to accede to request of allocation of talabira-ii coal block to hindalco, the said note ""was conveniently overlooked/not approved at the higher levels."" it said fresh proposals were made by parakh primarily to accommodate hindalco in allocation of talabira-ii coal block but dasari narayan rao had cautioned that any deviation from screening committee recommendations will not be appropriate. the court also appeared to agree with the submission of supreme court-appointed special public prosecutor (spp) r s cheema who had argued before it that he does not agree with the conclusion drawn in the final report that no criminal offence has been committed in the entire process. ""in fact, the submission of spp rs cheema appears to be a logical conclusion flowing out not only from the various documents which were seized during the course of investigation but also from the manner in which the entire process was undertaken by the moc and the pmo,"" it said. — pti ",court asks cbi record manmohan statement coal scam,"new delhi , december 16 cbi today directed special court record statements former prime minister manmohan singh , holding charge coal minister 2005 , others coal blocks allocation scam case allegedly involving top industrialist kumar mangalam birla. refusing accept cbi ' closure report filed matter , special cbi judge bharat parashar said : "" ordered investigation. desire statements minister coal ( manmohan singh ) recorded besides officials.

sibal claimed singh had to choose between the recommendations of odisha chief minister naveen patnaik and the screening committee of officials. in a democracy and federal structure, the prime minister had to give greater weight to the cm’s view rather than to that of officials and as such, singh decided to allocate 15 per cent of the coal reserves in the two blocks to hindalco, while the remaining share would go to public sector companies — neyveli lignite corporation (nlc) and the mahanadi coal fields ltd (mcl). ignoring the screening committee guidelines could hardly be construed as a criminal act, sibal pleaded citing several sc judgments in support of his contention. on march 11, the trial court had held that there was prima facie evidence to suggest singh was part of an alleged conspiracy and corrupt practice in the allocation. “the trial court is wrong on several counts, not just one or two,” sibal pleaded. senior advocates ashwani kumar and kts tulsi also appeared for singh. kumar later said today’s sc order confirmed the strong prima facie case in favour of singh and “we in the legal team believe that ultimately justice will be vindicated and truth will prevail.” in its order, the sc said “the impugned order is required to be stayed and accordingly stayed” and granted three weeks’ time to the cbi for its response. it said would examine the objections raised by singh and others. sibal argued that the trial court had gone wrong while deciding to go ahead with the case under the prevention of corruption act, 1988 and in deciding that no prior sanction was required to prosecute singh. questioning the trial court’s logic, he said singh had taken the decision in his capacity as pm and coal minister and as such permission was needed to prosecute him. further, the trial court had no power to record a finding on the facts of the case at the stage of issuing summons, he contended. senior advocates harish salve and abhishekh singhvi appeared for birla and hindalco, respectively, during the hearing that lasted about half-an-hour. the courtroom was packed with advocates, including those who had no case for the day, and mediapersons.","coal scam : sc stays summons manmohan , five others","r sedhuraman new delhi , april 1 supreme court gave major relief former prime minister manmohan singh today staying summons personal appearance trial court april 8 case alleged criminal conspiracy corruption allocation talabira coal blocks ( ii &amp;

""your government is insensitive,"" he said adding modi was riding a bullet train in japan when old, women and common man were queuing up at banks at 3 am in the morning to get currency to buy their daily needs. sharma said modi had in his goa speech had stated that those standing in line at banks were those involved in 2g spectrum and coal scam as well as holding black money. ""i condemn the prime minister for calling the poor standing in queue for his rs 4,000-4,500, black money holders and scamster,"" he said. referring to modi's statement in goa last week that certain forces were out to eliminate him, the congress leader asked him to name the conspirators wanting to eliminate prime minister of india. congress will not tolerate anyone planning to harm the prime minister of the country, he said. taking a dig at the modi, he said someone who ""changes clothes five times a day"", has become prime minister and travels around the globe was ""calling himself a sanyasi and tapasvi"". sharma demanded that the names of persons holding accounts in swiss bank and those revealed in the leichtenstein and hsbc lists should be made public. the names of bank loan defaulters above rs 5000 crore should also be made public. while the decision had put the common man to immense hardship by way of having to stand in long queues to lay hands on valid currency to meet daily needs, the information about demonetisation was selectively leaked to the ""friends of bjp,"" sharma alleged. the move had branded 86 per cent of the currency in circulation blackmoney and ""everyone a criminal,"" he said adding when modi announced the plan it was expected that adequate arrangements would be made for dispensing new notes. so banks and atms were shut on november 9 but the expectations of normalcy from next day were dashed with queues only getting longer by the day. the government policy was to ""benefit those who are your friends and hurt those who question you,"" he said adding an atmosphere has been created in the country where questions cannot be asked and those doing so branded anti-nationals. ""the magnanimous prime minister allowed rs 4,000 of old currency to be changed... what right does the constitution give the government to place restrictions on withdrawal of ones hard-earned money,"" he asked, adding one has to ""beg to be allowed to withdraw his own money."" he said former rbi governor ig patel had written about the government's decision to demonetise currency in 1978 and it would be absurd to think that all ill-gotten money is kept in cash and not invested in real estate, billion, equities or foreign exchange. modi, sharma said, had reasoned that withdrawal of the higher denomination currency to fight against black money, terrorist funding and counterfeit currency. congress is unequivocally opposed to black money and opposes any force that print counterfeit currency. sharma said the government in one stroke took away 86.4 per cent of the over rs 16 lakh crore currency in circulation. ""did the government think that 86 per cent of the currency in circulation was counterfeit or blackmoney,"" he asked. communist party of india (marxist) general secretary sitaram yechury and bahujan samaj party (bsp) national president mayawati also criticised the government for not having poor implementation. yechury demanded to know if the decision the withdraw rs 500/100 notes and introducing a rs 2000 denomination would stop corruption. “if you stop rs 500/1000 notes, do you think corruption will stop? now corruption will double with rs 2000 notes,” sitaram yechury said. “none of the points said by pm stand on any strong footing, whether its terror funding, black money, counterfeit currency, or corruption. if none of the objectives are to be fulfilled by this, what is the meaning of this move?” he also demanded that the government should continue to allow the old currency to be used until the government came up with better arrangements. “the prime minister said 50 days more required for alternative arrangement to come into place,” yechury said. “till those alternative arrangements are not in place, allow these notes to be transacted for all white transactions, public purposes. do not stop for usage in hospitals, transport and railway tickets. get your alternative ready. atms are not calibrated."" mayawati accused the government of poor planning. “the prime minister said govt has been preparing for demonetisation since the past 10 months, that is enough time. still situation is out of control,” mayawati said. “the fact is that these 10 months were used to handle black money accumulated by bjp leaders and industrialists.” — agencies ","bjp , friends knew demonetisation move : oppn rs","new delhi , november 16 launching scathing attack prime minister narendra modi , opposition parties wednesday alleged selective leak information demonetisation 500 1000 rupee notes ' friends bjp ' demanded making public names bought gold foreign exchange rs 1 crore since april. initiating debate listed business suspended take discussion november 8 decision withdraw old higher denomination currency , anand sharma ( cong ) used wit humour attack modi insensitive problems caused common man. ; ( follow tribune facebook ; twitter @thetribunechd ) asked prime minister state got rs 23,000-24,000 crore , estimated international money watch group , lok sabha elections. also asked cheque credit card payments made organise rally ghazipur uttar pradesh days ago. alleging information demonetisation selectively leaked , said , "" bjp units deposited crores ( november 8 decision ) .
