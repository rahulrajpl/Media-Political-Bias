""we make it a point to mail these cards to the individuals concerned,"" prakash said. the employees often spend their own money to do this. ""since this season began, i have posted close to 20 pan cards to the income tax office."" police say all this is the work of pickpockets who operate in the temple town -- crowded during the pilgrimage season. the criminals pocket the money from the wallets and dump the cards -- and wallets -- in the post boxes. situated in the mountain ranges of the western ghats at 914 metres above sea level, the sabarimala temple is four kilometres uphill from pamba in pathanamthitta district, around 100 km from thiruvananthapuram. the temple is accessible only on foot from pamba. during the last pilgrimage season, more than 4.5 million devotees visited the shrine. this season the authorities expect a 10 per cent increase. a feature of the post office is the special pictorial cancellation stamp of the 18 steps that led to the lord ayyappa shrine.

2018-09-28,lone woman judge dissents: justice indu malhotra's verdict on sabarimala case,"satya prakash  new delhi, september 28 justice indu malhotra—the lone woman judge on the five-judge constitution bench—on friday surprised many by delivering a dissenting verdict in the sabarimala temple entry case in which four of her brother judges allowed women of all age groups to enter the famous lord ayyappa temple. in a strong dissent, justice malhotra disagreed with almost all important points in the majority verdicts delivered by chief justice of india dipak misra and justice am khanwilkar and the concurring ones by justice rf nariman and justice dy chandrachud, who declared the sabarimala temple did not constitute a religious denomination. justice malhotra said such an issue could not be decided without a proper trial as it “is a mixed question of fact and law”. the temple was entitled to protection under article 26 as a religious denomination, she said. she went on to uphold the restriction on entry of women in the age group of 10 to 50 years in the temple saying: “in a secular polity, issues which are matters of deep religious faith and sentiment, must not ordinarily be interfered with by courts”. she also upheld the validity of rule 3(b) of the kerala hindu places of public worship (authorisation of entry) rules, 1965, which was declared invalid by the majority. “the right to equality under article 14 in matters of religion and religious beliefs has to be viewed differently. it has to be adjudged amongst the worshippers of a particular religion or shrine, who are aggrieved by certain practises which are found to be oppressive or pernicious… the worshippers of this temple believe in the manifestation of the deity as a ‘naishtik brahmachari’. the devotees of this temple have not challenged the practises followed by this temple, based on the essential characteristics of the deity,” she said. ; justice malhotra also disagreed with justice chandrachud’s conclusion that the practice amounted to untouchability. “the customs practised by the devotees at the sabarimala temple do not flow from any practise associated with untouchability under article 17. the custom is not based on any alleged impurity or disability,” justice malhotra said rejecting the petitioners contention that the restriction amounted to untouchability. batting for protection of diverse religious practices, she said: “the constitution ensures a place for diverse religions, creeds, denominations and sects thereof to co-exist in a secular society. it is necessary that the term ‘religious denomination’ should receive an interpretation which is in furtherance of the constitutional object of a pluralistic society”. she said: “the equality doctrine enshrined under article 14 does not override the fundamental right (to religion) guaranteed by article 25 to every individual to freely profess, practise and propagate their faith, in accordance with the tenets of their religion”. “constitutional morality in a secular polity would imply the harmonisation of the fundamental rights, which include the right of every individual, religious denomination, or sect, to practise their faith and belief in accordance with the tenets of their religion, irrespective of whether the practice is rational or logical,” she noted. justice malhotra said, “the issues raised in the present writ petition have far-reaching ramifications and implications, not only for the sabarimala temple in kerala, but for all places of worship of various religions in this country, which have their own beliefs, practices, customs and usages, which may be considered to be exclusionary in nature.” she said: “the practice of celibacy and austerity is the unique characteristic of the deity in the sabarimala temple. hindu deities have both physical/temporal and philosophical form. the same deity is capable of having different physical and spiritual forms or manifestations. worship of each of these forms is unique, and not all forms are worshipped by all persons. the form of the deity in any temple is of paramount importance”. “worship has two elements—the worshipper, and the worshipped. the right to worship under article 25 cannot be claimed in the 65 absence of the deity in the particular form in which he has manifested himself.” “religion is a matter of faith, and religious beliefs are held to be sacred by those who share the same faith. thought, faith and belief are internal, while expression and worship are external manifestations thereof. in the case of the sabarimala temple, the manifestation is in the form of a ‘naishtik brahmachari’”. the belief in a deity, and the form in which he has manifested himself is a fundamental right protected by article 25(1) of the constitution. the phrase “equally entitled to”, as it occurs in article 25(1), must mean that each devotee is equally entitled to profess, practise and propagate his religion, as per the tenets of that religion. “in the present case, the celibate nature of the deity at the sabarimala temple has been traced by the respondents to the sthal purana of this temple chronicled in the ‘bhuthanatha geetha’. evidence of these practises are also documented in the memoir of the survey of the travancore and cochin states written by lieutenants ward and conner published in two parts in 1893 and 1901,” she said, adding the practice has been followed consistently since time immemorial. “in the present case, the character of the temple at sabarimala is unique on the basis of centuries old religious practises followed to preserve the manifestation of the deity, and the worship associated with it. any interference with the mode and manner of worship of this religious denomination, or sect, would impact the character of the temple, and affect the beliefs and practises of the worshippers of this temple,” justice malhotra said, upholding the contention of the temple thanthri, the travancore devaswom board that manages the temple and believers of lord ayyappa.

2018-10-08,is sabarimala verdict correct?,"by satya prakash t he supreme court's verdict removing age restrictions on entry of women to the famous lord ayyappa temple at sabarimala in kerala has exposed the limits of judicial interventions based on constitutional morality in dealing with perceived discriminatory religious practices. the verdict — which has stirred up a hornets' nest of angry women devotees — highlights the shortcomings of the “essential practices” test applied to deny a religious denomination status to sabarimala temple and lord ayyappa's devotees. almost every village in india has a different religious practices and applying a straight-jacketed “essential practices” test can destroy religious diversity and pluralism practised since times immemorial in hinduism — once described by the sc as a way of life. the ruling by former cji dipak misra and justices am khanwilkar, rf nariman and dy chandrachud raises certain fundamental questions about relationship between the state and religion in a constitutional democracy which guarantees a set of fundamental right to every citizen — the most important of all being right to life, right to equality and right to religion. as an institution, religion has existed for millennia and pre-dates the modern indian state — a constitutional entity which is less than seven decades old. india has nurtured diverse and even extreme religious practices. there are several temples where men are not allowed. indians worship lingam and yoni, animals, rivers, trees, plants and what not. it’s not for the state or its instrumentalities to apply rational yardsticks and judge the validity of such practices unless it borders criminality. ; “... the court cannot impose its morality or rationality with respect to the form of worship of a deity. doing so would negate the freedom to practise one’s religion according to one’s faith. it would amount to rationalising religion, faith and beliefs, which is outside the ken of court,” noted justice indu malhotra in her dissenting verdict. unlike in europe, where religion had established a vice like grip over the state, in india it was much more benign and didn’t disturb the state. it’s rather strange that while in europe, the process of separating religion from the state gave birth to secularism; a secular state like india has been busy controlling religious institutions and correcting religious practices. this is not to suggest that the state can’t intervene in matters relating to religion. article 25 — which guarantees fundamental right to religion — authorises the state to make laws to regulate economic, financial, political or other secular activity associated with religious practices. article 26 is aimed at ensuring religious diversity and pluralism. article 25 and article 26 together represent a social contract between religion and the state and draw a 'lakshman rekha'. the verdict appears to be a victim of political correctness and an attempt to secularise hinduism as it over-stretches the notions of equality and discrimination. the supreme court will get an opportunity to reconsider its verdict very soon as review petitions are being filed soon. will it correct it?

hitting back at shah, vijayan reminded him that the state government was not at the mercy of the bjp. “but this is a government elected by the people. shah’s speech gives the message that the electoral verdict will be sabotaged,” vijayan claimed in a statement. “all democratic-minded people should raise their voice against this,” he said. vijayan also claimed that shah’s speech was more against the supreme court and the constitution rather than against the state government. shah said even though prime minister narendra modi had released various central projects for the state, none of them have been taken up. “if the state government had shown the same interest in meeting the grievances of the flood-affected people as it had shown in taking on the ayyappa devotees, i would have said they have fulfilled their responsibilities. “but they have failed and the chief minister has no right to continue in office even for a minute,” the bjp chief said. shah said hinduism has always given respect to women and worshipped them. gender equality cannot be ensured just by giving rights to them to offer prayers at temples, the bjp chief said. “even women in the state were against government’s move to implement the sc order,” he said. shah, who began and concluded his speech with ‘swamiya saranam ayyappa’ mantra, cautioned the left government that the clampdown on the agitation amounted to “playing with fire”. he said hindu faith has never undermined women. “hinduism has always stood for social reformation and against social evils like child marriage. “but in the name of ending social evils, if the government here tries to interfere in the customs and traditions of lord ayyappa, bjp workers across the country would stand like a rock behind the devotees,” he said. over 2,000 people, including bjp, rss and nair service society (nss) workers have been arrested in a state-wide crackdown and many have been put behind bars on non-bailable offences, he claimed. the bjp was planning to launch agitations from october 30-november 12 to protect the rituals and traditions of the hill shrine, he said, adding that the party would go to any length to preserve the temple’s customs and traditions. “there is no restriction on women to offer prayers in any other ayyappa temple. the uniqueness of the sabarimala shrine, where the main deity is ‘naishtika brahmachari’ (perennial celibate) has to be protected,” he said. “hinduism has varied customs. there are many temples in the country where only women are allowed and not men, and there are also shrines where only men are allowed,” he said. the state had witnessed massive protests from devotees at various places, including sabarimala, nilakkal and pamba, against permitting women of all ages to enter the shrine when it was opened for monthly pujas from october 17-22. shah also visited the house of a bjp worker remith, who was killed allegedly by cpi(m) workers in 2002. pti",shah backs sabarimala devotees ;
