2010-12-18,aicc plenary to focus on graft anita katyal our political correspondent," anita katyal our political correspondent new delhi, december 17 when congress president sonia gandhi addressed the aicc delegates in november she had steered clear of making any reference to the raging allegations of corruption like the adarsh housing scam or the commonwealth games mess and had instead trained her guns on the bjps parent organisation, the rss, for its involvement in acts of terror.in contrast, the upcoming aicc plenary session being held on the outskirts of delhi in burari from december 18-20, will have a sharp focus on corruption and the issue of probity in public life while keeping up the attack on the bjp. the congress leadership can hardly afford to keep silent on this issue any longer as the allegations of corruption it is facing have dealt a huge blow to its image and severely dented its credibility. the opposition, on the other hand, has been galvanised after these revelations. after disrupting the entire winter session of parliament, the opposition has mounted a nation-wide campaign to press its demand for a joint parliamentary committee (jpc) and to put the congress-led upa government in the dock for its involvement in scams.it has, therefore, become imperative for the congress to come out with a cogent response to the opposition offensive. the congress presidents speech to party mps on the last day of parliament provided a glimpse of what will be on offer during the plenary deliberations.countering the opposition charges, sonia gandhi had given details of the investigations being conducted by the various agencies into all these cases and the action already taken by the government like a rajas resignation and the change of guard in maharashtra. the congress will, in turn, attack the bjp for its cover-up of corruption in karnataka and remind the main opposition party about its involvement in the tehelka sting operation and the coffin scam.despite sonia gandhis aggressive speech at the cpp meeting, there is an air of despondency in the party on the eve of the plenary session which has been cynically described by a senior congress leader as a gala event. besides having to deal with the fall-out of the scams and corruption allegations, the party has also to contend with its dismal performance in the bihar assembly elections where the congress grand plans of an upper caste revival in its favour came to nought. the partys health in other states is also not very sound. the congress can expect to pay a heavy price for the dmks transgressions in the next years assembly elections in tamil nadu. it is on shaky ground in andhra pradesh where the telangana movement could erupt any time. jaganmohan reddy, late chief ministers son, who recently left the congress to float his own party, has the potential to play spoilsport in the southern state. the congress has not been able to pin down any of the bjp governments in states like karnataka, madhya pradesh and chhattisgarh where it is in the opposition because of bitter internal feuds.although the plenary will predictably end with a stirring call to the cadres to take on the bjp, several congress leaders predict that the country could be headed for a phase of instability as the ongoing stalemate in the polity will further weaken the congress but not necessarily throw up a viable non-congress alternative. unlike the late eighties when the bjp and the left joined hands to take on the congress, the possibility of these two parties coming together this time appears remote.
