the government is keen to get the gst bill cleared in the upcoming monsoon session of parliament and there is a buzz that it may table the bill in the upper house on the very first day of the session on july 18. jaitley is also said to be open to talking to the senior leadership of the congress before the session begins. the government is banking on support from smaller regional parties to pass the national sales tax legislation in the upper house of parliament and then get supporting laws enacted by the year-end so that gst is introduced from april 2017. the gst bill, which intends to convert 29 states into a single market through a new indirect tax regime, was earlier planned to be introduced from april 1 this year, but the deadline was missed as the bill to roll it out remains in a limbo in the opposition-dominated rajya sabha. after parliament approves the constitutional amendment to allow gst, it needs to be ratified by more than half of the states. then, parliament must pass another bill to implement gst. after the constitution amendment bill is passed in parliament, there are three more legislations - central gst (cgst), state gst (sgst) and integrated gst (igst) - which are required to be passed. the gst bill, which will help create a single national sales tax to replace several state and central levies, has already been approved by the lok sabha and is pending in the upper house where the government doesn’t have a majority. — pti ","ring-fencing gst rate ‘sensible suggestion ’ , says govt functionary","new delhi , july 9 congress showed signs softening stand gst tax rate “ring-fenced ” , top government functionary saturday said “sensible suggestion ” talks continue opposition party. congress , originally mooted goods services tax ( gst ) 2009 replace indirect taxes , demanding overall rate capped 18 per cent scrapping additional 1 per cent tax designed compensate manufacturing states fear losing revenue. anand sharma , congress ’ deputy leader rajya sabha gst bill stuck , reported said party open discussing demand including tax rate constitutional amendment bill government come suggestion ring-fence tax rate. reacting , top government functionary said , “it ’ sensible suggestion. keep talking them. ” since november last year , congress insisting specified gst rate 18 per cent mentioned constitutional amendment bill , 1 per cent additional tax abolished gst disputes settlement authority formed settle state disputes. finance minister arun jaitley , however , consistently maintained nowhere world tax rates put constitution government needs flexibility change rates case contingencies like natural calamity. ;

“but we are engaging with it. if someone says ‘no’ once, it does not mean he won’t agree at all, like gst, almost all parties have agreed to it but the congress. that does not mean it will never agree,” swaraj said amidst opposition protests over attacks against dalits in gujarat, including sloganeering from the well. the minister rejected suggestions that india had created a lot of “hype” ahead of the nsg meet in seoul. “we have been taught to make serious efforts to achieve things...no hype was created when we submitted our application for the membership of nsg on may 12. it was a low-key affair,” she said. swaraj also scoffed at suggestions by supriya sule of the ncp that the denial of nsg membership to india was a “huge diplomatic snub” as it came after prime minister narendra modi’s visit to mexico and switzerland. she said mexico supported india’s bid and when the decision did not go in new delhi’s favour, mexico asked the group to decide again on the issue. asserting that indian diplomacy had made its mark, she said earlier people used to ask whether india could make it to the nsg, whereas “now the question being asked is when india would become a member”. responding to a question on the benefits of getting nsg membership, swaraj said india would then become part of “rule-making” from its current position of a “rule taker”. “waiver is like being allowed in the verandah. membership is like being in the room...being part of rule-making,” swaraj said. she said though india had not signed the npt, it is following the commitments made when it got the waiver in 2008. swaraj also credited the previous upa government with getting the waiver saying while the upa government followed the commitments, the present government is following them since it came to power in 2014. she said the nsg membership would enable india to have an enhanced and uninterrupted access to nuclear technology, fuel and material required for expanding its civil nuclear programme. “it would create a predictable environment for large investments required for setting up nuclear power plants in india, inter alia, to meet india’s intended nationally determined contribution pledge of 40 per cent of its power capacity coming from non-fossil sources by 2030,” she said. pti",‘india ’ sign npt engaging china nsg ’,"new delhi , july 20 asserting china created “procedural hurdles ” india getting membership elite nuclear suppliers group ( nsg ) , goverment wednesday said engaging neighbour iron differences expressing hope issues would resolved. external affairs minister sushma swaraj said india would sign nuclear non-proliferation treaty , adding new delhi managed get waiver 2008 without signing treaty. responding supplementaries question hour lok sabha , said china questioned non-signatory npt could become member nsg. ;

""the amendments to the gst constitutional amendment bill have been cleared,"" a top official said after the meeting of the union cabinet chaired by modi. the amendments were taken up by the cabinet after finance minister arun jaitley’s assurance to state finance ministers to include in the bill the mechanism of compensating states for all the loss of revenue for five years. the bill, in its present form, provides that the centre will give 100 per cent compensation to states for first three years, 75 per cent and 50 per cent for the next two years. however, the select committee of the rajya sabha had in its report recommended 100 per cent compensation for probable loss of revenue for five years. as per the amendments, the centre will now constitutionally guarantee states any loss of revenue from the gst subsuming all indirect taxes, including vat, in the first five years of introduction. by doing away with the 1 per cent inter-state tax over and above the gst rate, the government has met one of the three key demands over which opposition congress has been blocking the bill in the upper house. the other demands of including gst rate in the statute and a supreme court judge-headed dispute resolution body has not been accepted. it remains to be seen if meeting of its demands halfway will persuade the congress to support the legislation. there is a talk of mentioning the gst rate in one of the two supporting legislations that need to be passed after the constitution is amended, a move that may pacify the congress. the government plans to roll out gst by april 1, 2017, and is working overtime to build consensus to get the bill passed in the ongoing session. with the congress demand of getting gst rate capped in the bill delaying its passage, the centre yesterday built a broad consensus with the states that the rate should not be mentioned in the constitution and instead could figure in gst law. it was also assured that the tax rate in the new regime, which is to be decided by the gst council, will be less than what it is at present. ""the amendments will pave the way for political consensus and early passage of the bill in the monsoon session,"" ey national leader (indirect tax) harishanker subramaniam said. in the new regime, there will be one central gst or c-gst and state gst or s-gst. states levy sales tax or vat on goods sold within their jurisdiction and get a central sales tax (cst) on sales made outside their territories. this cst will no longer be available in the new regime and a 1 per cent additional tax was proposed to make up for that. the road ahead gst being a constitutional amendment requires to be passed by parliament with two-thirds majority and after that, 50 per cent of state assemblies will have to pass the legislation. thereafter, the lok sabha and the rajya sabha will have to pass the central gst bill and the states have to pass their own gst bills. after the legislative procedure gets over, the gst council, which will be the decision-making body on all issues, including rates of the new tax, will come into play. the council will be chaired by union finance minister, but centre's voting share will be one-third and all decisions of the council would be taken by 75 per cent majority. terming compensation guarantee as a very big development, chairman of the empowered committee of state finance ministers amit mitra had yesterday said appropriate wordings on compensation would give confidence to the states regarding the centre's intention. ""i cannot go into details of the wordings, i can only give you spirit of it. states are satisfied that in the constitutional amendment, the wording (will be provided) by which states will be guaranteed five years of compensation if there is any loss of revenue,"" mitra said. the gst bill, which intends to convert 29 states into a single market through a new indirect tax regime, was earlier planned to be introduced from april 1 this year, but the deadline was missed as the legislation to roll it out remains in limbo in the opposition-dominated rajya sabha. — pti","cabinet approves gst changes , drops 1 % manufacturing tax","new delhi , july 27 cabinet wednesday cleared changes gst constitutional amendment bill , dropping 1 per cent manufacturing tax providing guarantee compensate states revenue loss first five years rollout proposed indirect tax regime. cabinet , headed prime minister narendra modi , decided include constitutional amendment bill dispute states centre adjudicated gst council , representation centre states. ; ( follow tribune facebook ; twitter @thetribunechd ) states board cabinet approving amendments , government hopeful passage long-pending goods services tax ( gst ) bill ongoing monsoon session parliament , ends august 12. gst bill , changes approved cabinet , could come rajya sabha early week , certainly next week. changes approved cabinet constitutional amendment bill approved lok sabha may last year. rajya sabha approves legislation , amended bill go back lok sabha approval.

2016-08-04,"gst to hit consumers, unorganised jobs most","sanjeev sharma  new delhi, august 3 the gst regime may have positives for the economy in the medium to long term, but consumers will feel the pinch as the cost of services such as mobile bills, financial services and eating out will go up when the new tax regime is implemented. apart from the consumer who will have to shell out more for services although the price of goods will go down, the pinch on the shoe is also for the unorganised sector that makes up for the maximum chunk of employment in the country. analysts say inflation can go up for a year after gst implementation. according to dbs research, there is likely to be a short-term lift to price pressures, especially as service taxes are raised from the current 15 per cent to 17-18 per cent, while some product taxes are lowered. “these adjustments, however, will partly offset each other, therefore lowering the net impact on inflation. either way, there is bound to be a temporary rise in inflation, which will typically last a year,” it said. ; the dbs expects actual gst implementation in second half of 2017 against the government’s april 2017 deadline. services are currently subject to 14.5 per cent tax and for goods at the higher end of its standard 12.5-14.5 per cent. if this basket (goods and services) is taxed at a higher 18 per cent, inflation could bounce by 0.4-0.7 per cent in the year of the implementation, dbs said. while the gst may have its advantages for the economy in creating a common market, consumers will have to pay more for services which accounts for 57 per cent of the gdp. a report by motilal oswal securities says that as far as the impact of gst on inflation is concerned, a moderate gst rate will help reduce wholesale price index (wpi), while the impact on consumer price index (cpi) will be limited. however, since services constitute a larger share in the consumption basket than in cpi, consumers may feel the pinch of higher prices of services as gst is implemented. another major impact of the gst regime is that it will shift trade from the unorganised to the organised segment. according to motilal oswal securities, gst would simplify and rationalise taxes, shift trade from the unorganised to the organised segment and improve efficiency in the system. the report says that india has significant presence of the unorganised sector. a national commission for enterprises in unorganised sector (nceus) report estimates that in 2005, out of the 485 million persons employed in india, 86 per cent or 395 million worked in the unorganised sector, generating 50.6 per cent of the country’s gdp. the report adds that implementation is expected to narrow the large indirect tax differential between the organised and unorganised players. this would be achieved by ensuring better compliance and enforcement by reducing the threshold limit for exemption from indirect taxes, tracking the flow of gst credit in the entire value chain using technology platforms, ensuring availability of seamless input credit, and reducing the overall effective tax rates. analysts say that the fear of job losses in a gst regime persists as it hits the unorganised players who have to now come under tax compliance while benefitting the mid-large sized companies which are already under the organised sector. some estimates suggest that the unorganised sector accounts for 6 times the jobs than the organised companies which are already under compliance. for instance, there will be a reduction in unorganised warehousing as the cost benefits reduce. there are estimates that while tax rates come down, the number of tax assesses can go up by 5-6 times.","gst hit consumers , unorganised jobs","sanjeev sharma new delhi , august 3 gst regime may positives economy medium long term , consumers feel pinch cost services mobile bills , financial services eating go new tax regime implemented. apart consumer shell services although price goods go , pinch shoe also unorganised sector makes maximum chunk employment country. analysts say inflation go year gst implementation. according dbs research , likely short-term lift price pressures , especially service taxes raised current 15 per cent 17-18 per cent , product taxes lowered. “these adjustments , however , partly offset , therefore lowering net impact inflation. either way , bound temporary rise inflation , typically last year , ” said. ;

(follow the tribune on facebook; and twitter @thetribunechd) “negotiations take place only if both sides are willing to be flexible,” senior congress leader jairam ramesh said. “both sides were pragmatic.” a jaitley aide said congress’s growing isolation proved decisive in making a compromise possible. “they had got themselves into a corner,” said the finance ministry official, who was privy to the talks. “they had two options: strike a deal and come out with your reputation intact, or lose your credibility.” last week’s unanimous upper house vote to pass the 122nd amendment to the constitution brings the wheel full circle — the gst was proposed by chidambram a decade ago but was stalled by political rivalry. introducing a unified sales tax across india’s market of 1.3 billion people would mark a bold act of integration at a time of disintegration elsewhere, as britain exits the european union and a protectionist, donald trump, runs for the us presidency. the gst vote also addresses how india, as a federation, can implement a one-size-fits-all sales tax — something the us and eu have been unable to do — by creating a gst council that brings the centre and the states together. tough bargaining on the rate and scope of the tax lies ahead, yet at least the atmosphere has improved, with chidambram praising jaitley’s “friendly and conciliatory tone”. that could revive projects that foundered early in modi’s rule, including land and labour reforms. early standoff despite winning biggest mandate in 30 years, modi has struggled to advance his agenda. the congress, though reduced to a rump opposition, has resisted. as the largest party in the upper house that represents the states, it had blocked the gst and derailed modi’s land acquisition bill, which critics branded as being “anti-farmer”. while that tactic proved effective, it wasn’t winning public support. the congress took hits in state elections and in june lost the upper house votes it needed to be sure of stopping the gst. this was the cue for jaitley to court the states, with key swing state west bengal soon declaring its support. in july, he targeted bihar, while at the same time re-engaging with the congress after nine months of radio silence. jaitley’s promise to the states to compensate revenue losses for five years, made at talks in new delhi on july 26, won them over, west bengal’s finance minister amit mitra told reuters. the congress moved to cut a deal, while modi and jaitley were ready to offer concessions — including scrapping a levy of 1 per cent on the movement of goods between states — that experts say would actually make the gst a better tax. on the morning of july 27, the congress submitted a written proposal, with new wording on resolving gst disputes between the centre and the states. modi’s cabinet approved identical tweaks that same evening. when it came to the august 3 vote, there were 203 votes in favour, and none against. the amendment passed the lower house on monday, also unanimously. it was a first for modi, who called the gst a “great step towards transformation”. — reuters","first isolate , negotiate : modi , fm cong","new delhi , august 10 took two years , prime minister narendra modi finally discovered art deal. realising frontal assault ’ securing votes needed india ’ biggest-ever tax reform , modi finance minister arun jaitley changed tack spring , government ruling party sources told reuters. first , sought build coalition among 29 state governments isolate congress , despite losing heavily modi 2014 blocked new goods services tax ( gst ) upper house parliament. , jaitley held series meetings congress leaders , whose outcome uncertain right last minute , sources close finance minister said. ; yielded demands — accepting , verbatim , clause proposed constitutional amendment needed make gst happen , according member congress team included former finance minister p. chidambaram.

""this would include clean energy cess and cesses on luxury items and tobacco products, which in any case, presently also pay levy higher than 26 per cent. this would ensure no additional burden on the tax payer and yet be able to compensate the losing states,"" he said. jaitley said it has been proposed to the council that there should be a 4-slab multi-rate tax structure with items accounting for nearly 50 per cent in the consumer price index basket (mainly food items) being exempted from the levy. ""there will be a zero tax on such items. the object of this is to ensure that the gst structure is not regressive or burdensome on the common man,"" he said. in the gst council meeting last week, some states had expressed concern over the centre's proposal to impose cess on demerit goods over and above the higher tax bracket of 26 per cent. a final decision on this is expected in the next meeting on november 3-4. pti",fm favours cess additional tax compensating states,"new delhi , october 26 finance minister arun jaitley wednesday favoured cess tobacco luxury products make revenue loss suffered goods services tax. ahead meeting all-powerful gst council next week decide gst rates , jaitley said 4-slab structure 6 , 12 , 18 26 per cent consideration , lower rates essential commodities higher bracket luxury goods.

2016-11-04,gst rate: 4 slabs from 5% to 28%," new delhi, november 3 in a major breakthrough for the rollout of the goods and services tax (gst) regime from april 1 next year, the gst rates have been finalised with a four-tier structure of 5, 12, 18 and 28 per cent while basic consumption items, such as foodgrain, will be taxed at zero per cent. these will include 50 per cent of the items in the consumer price index basket. the main objectives of the gst rates are to maintain revenue and to minimise the inflationary impact. the gst council determined the rates today, including levying of cess on demerit goods (tobacco, luxury goods and aerated drinks), to compensate the states with a five-year sunset clause (regulation that provides that a law shall cease to be effective after a specific date). while the lowest rate of 5 per cent will be for items of mass consumption, there would be two standard rates of 12 and 18 per cent. the highest tax slab of 28 per cent will be applicable to items such as white goods (electrical goods used domestically such as refrigerators and washing machines) which are currently taxed at 30-31 per cent (including excise duty and state levies). ; the goods and services tax seeks to implement a single indirect tax structure. the classification of items under each tax slab will be done later. the tax rate for gold will be finalised after classification. finance minister arun jaitley said luxury cars, tobacco and aerated drinks would be levied an additional cess on top of the highest tax rate which, along with the clean energy cess, would create a revenue pool to be used for compensating the states for any loss of revenue during the first five years of gst implementation. he said about rs 50,000 crore would be needed to compensate states for loss of revenue in the first year. on the need for the cess, he said generating the same revenue from taxes would have meant a burden of rs 1.72 lakh crore on the consumer. the four-tier tax structure, reached by consensus, is a slight modification of the 6, 12, 18 and 26 per cent slabs discussed by the gst council last month. the structure is a compromise to accommodate the demand for the highest tax rate of 40 per cent by states such as kerala. jaitley said while the centre proposed to levy a 4 per cent gst on gold, a final decision had been put off. he said the higher rate of 28 per cent would be used to shift items used by a large section (soap, oil) from the 28 per cent slab to the 18 per cent slab.",gst rate : 4 slabs 5 % 28 %,"new delhi , november 3 major breakthrough rollout goods services tax ( gst ) regime april 1 next year , gst rates finalised four-tier structure 5 , 12 , 18 28 per cent basic consumption items , foodgrain , taxed zero per cent. include 50 per cent items consumer price index basket. main objectives gst rates maintain revenue minimise inflationary impact. gst council determined rates today , including levying cess demerit goods ( tobacco , luxury goods aerated drinks ) , compensate states five-year sunset clause ( regulation provides law shall cease effective specific date ) . lowest rate 5 per cent items mass consumption , would two standard rates 12 18 per cent. highest tax slab 28 per cent applicable items white goods ( electrical goods used domestically refrigerators washing machines ) currently taxed 30-31 per cent ( including excise duty state levies ) . ; goods services tax seeks implement single indirect tax structure. classification items tax slab done later. tax rate gold finalised classification. finance minister arun jaitley said luxury cars , tobacco aerated drinks would levied additional cess top highest tax rate , along clean energy cess , would create revenue pool used compensating states loss revenue first five years gst implementation. said rs 50,000 crore would needed compensate states loss revenue first year. need cess , said generating revenue taxes would meant burden rs 1.72 lakh crore consumer. four-tier tax structure , reached consensus , slight modification 6 , 12 , 18 26 per cent slabs discussed gst council last month. structure compromise accommodate demand highest tax rate 40 per cent states kerala. jaitley said centre proposed levy 4 per cent gst gold , final decision put off. said higher rate 28 per cent would used shift items used large section ( soap , oil ) 28 per cent slab 18 per cent slab .","{'bjp': 0, 'cong': 0}",0,0,0.09839951714951717
2016-11-04,consensus eludes on jurisdiction of assessees in gst,"new delhi, november 4 for the second time in as many weeks, the centre and states on friday failed to reach a consensus on who will control which set of assessees under gst, a disagreement that threatens to derail the april 1 target for rollout of the new indirect tax regime. after nailing a four-tier rate structure of 5, 12, 18 and 28 per cent, the second day of the all-powerful gst council failed to reach a consensus over which category of assessees should be governed by the centre and which by states. the november 9-10 meeting of the council has been called off. it was to finalise the draft law and supporting legislations for subsuming an array of central and state levies, including excise duty, service tax and vat. the finance ministers of states will now meet informally on november 20 to evolve a political consensus on the sticky issue. the next meeting of the gst council, headed by finance minister arun jaitley, has been scheduled for november 24-25. ; jaitley, who had previously stated that he hoped for all modalities for the gst to be finalised by november 22, was still hopeful of getting the supporting legislations during the ensuing winter session of parliament from november 16. ""that's the effort. i am endeavouring to do that,"" he said when asked if the cgst and igst legislations will come before parliament in the upcoming session. ""when in the month of august we passed the constitution amendment, it appeared too challenging because the time was very short. as of today, i am more confident than i was in august. let me say this because bulk of the spade work has been done. most of the decisions have been taken. only one key decision remains,"" he said. differences on the issue of cross empowerment to avoid dual control arose with states demanding control over 11 lakh service tax assessees, and centre proposing to do away states having exclusive control over all dealers up to an annual revenue threshold of rs 1.5 crore -- an issue which was settled in the first meeting of the gst council. no decision could be arrived at the end of the third meeting of the council on october 19. jaitley said the draft cgst, igst, sgst and compensation laws will be sent to states after november 15 and the gst council in november 24-25 meeting will approve them. he said all pros and cons have to be weighed before deciding on the issues of cross empowerment to ensure single interface under gst, which will subsume excise, service tax, vat and other local levies. “in order to resolve it we will have an informal meeting of the ministers, in order to find a political solution to this problem, and we will try and thrash out a solution on the november 20 between these options or may be a hybrid option of this,"" he said. in the last meeting of the council, five proposals were discussed, but today the council has arrived at an option of two proposals-- horizontal division and vertical division. 'horizontal division' would mean tax payers would be divided both for administrative and audit purposes based on a cut off turnover. those with a turnover over rs 1.5 crore would be administered both by the centre and states, while those with below rs 1.5 crore would be administered solely by the state. the 'vertical division' based on ratios assigns tax payers to a tax administration, centre or state, for a period of 3 years for all purposes, including audit. tax payers could be divided in a ratio which would balance the interest of the centre and the state, both with respect to revenue and spread of numbers. jaitley said the matter is complex and hence the centre and states do not want to rush through with the final answer as the consequences of this are unforeseen. ""you can have neighbouring shopkeepers being assessed by different authorities and therefore what will be the consequence of that?"" according to sources, the centre feels that horizontal division would be lopsided as 93 per cent of service tax assessees and 85 per cent of the vat tax payers have a turnover below rs 1.5 crore. the gst council also felt that distinction between goods and services cannot be maintained as works contract, construction contract, restaurants -- all these have vat and service tax and it is not possible to disintegrate them. on the issue of deciding tax jurisdiction, jaitley said one asseessee should not be subjected to assessment by multiple assessing officers and there should be clear guidelines on it. deloitte haskins & sells llp partner prashant deshpande said drafts on cgst, igst, sgst-- to be prepared by november 14-15 -- should be made available for public consumption.

(follow the tribune on facebook; and twitter @thetribunechd) ; with only three working days left before the winter session comes to a close on december 16, the question is whether the warring sides would consider it worthwhile — politically smart, that is — to make brownie points inside the parliament, especially when they can score bigger by speaking outside? the past four weeks have seen battle lines over the central government’s decision to invalidate old high-denomination banknotes of rs 500 and rs 1000. the bjp government claims it is willing to debate, only not under the opposition’s terms — such as requiring the prime minister’s presence in rajya sabha during the debate. the opposition claims it has always been willing to debate, provided the central government fulfill certain conditions. in the lok sabha, where the bjp has the numbers to pin the opposition down, party leaders say they do not want to be seen as conceding to ""unreasonable"" demands. “the house functions according to rules, not according to the whims and fancies of the opposition,” they said in response to congress's allegations of not allowing its vice-president to speak on friday. in the meantime, the fate of legislative bills of public importance, such as the rights of persons with disabilities bill, 2014, hangs in the balance, even as large sum of money continues to be wasted over a paralysed parliament: each minute of a session is reported to cost the exchequer more than rs 2.5 lakh. leaders from all political parties indicate that a breakthrough in the impasse was likely in the next week and that important bills may be pushed through. more than 20 crucial bills await introduction, consideration and passage during the ongoing winter session. however, bills related to the goods and services act appear to remain evasive. officials in the central government say introduction of the indirect tax may have to be pushed to september next year — five months later than the central government had intended (apri1 1, 2017 was their deadline) — as the gst council continues to disagree about the centre’s dual tax regime under the policy. meanwhile, as the deadline for the 50-day period that prime minister modi had asked for from the public over demonetisation draws near, some voices within the party fear that the bjp had fallen prey to “overconfidence"", somewhat similar to what happened when former nda prime minister atal behari vajpayee advanced general elections in 2004. there are reports of some banks being stoned, an atm looted and the prime minister being booed at some rallies in uttar pradesh, where elections are due early next year. “demonetisation is a bold decision. but whether it is politically smart or foolish is something that remains to be seen,” some leaders say. another worry is the quantity of old rs 500 and rs 1000 currency deposited in the banks since the central government announced the measure on november 8: reports claim that an overwhelming 86 per cent high-value currency has already been deposited. with merely 18 days remaining for the central government’s deadline of december 30, the money in banks on january 1, 2017, could raise questions over the central government’s claims of combating black money — the problem modi’s measure primarily targets.

(follow the tribune on facebook; and twitter @thetribunechd) ; “one of the efforts of this exercise has to be that even though a reduced cash currency could remain, our conscious effort...

""the measures such as transition to the nationwide gst and the withdrawal of legal tender status of specified bank notes (old rs 500/1000) could potentially transform the domestic economy, notwithstanding some inconvenience to public and the momentary adverse impact on growth,"" rbi said. these observations were made in the report on trend and progress of banking in india 2015-16 (rtp) and the 14th issue of the financial stability report (fsr). in his foreword to fsr, rbi governor urjit patel said the withdrawal of rs 500/1000 notes ""will impart far-reaching changes going forward"". ; ""it is expected to significantly transform the domestic economy in due course in terms of greater intermediation, efficiency gains, accountability and transparency through increasing adoption of digital modes of payments, notwithstanding the short-term disruptions in certain segments of the economy and public hardship,"" he said. the governor also cautioned that there is ""little room"" for complacency and it is important to guard against sporadic volatility in financial markets. rbi further said the banking stability indicator shows that the risks to the banking sector remained elevated due to continuous deterioration in asset quality, low profitability and liquidity. the business growth of banks remained subdued with public sector banks (psbs) continuing to lag their private sector peers. system level profit after tax (pat) contracted on y-o-y basis in the first half of 2016-17. the asset quality of banks deteriorated further between march and september 2016. psbs continued to record the lowest capital to risk-weighted assets ratio (crar) among the bank groups with negative returns on their assets.

""charitable purpose"", as defined by law, includes relief to poor, education, medical relief, and the advancement of any other object of general public utility. the words ""not involving the carrying on of any activity of profit"" were omitted by the finance act, 1983. continuing in the same vein, a circular was issued by the central board of direct taxes in 2008, clarifying that an institution providing relief to the poor, education and medical facilities, would be allowed exemption even when it has incidental commercial activities. the gst regime is now set to disrupt the status-quo, including educational activities. gst is an indirect tax, a tax on consumption of goods and services. an inherent feature of indirect tax is that the burden of the tax, rather than being borne by the industry (i.e., the manufacturers or traders or service providers), is passed to the consumers. so, gst on private education, if it is implemented, would be borne by those looking to avail education services. therefore, the issue of whether education is the place for disruptions, which might otherwise be a good thing, merits consideration. education, once viewed largely as a philanthropic activity, has now metamorphosed into a $100 billion (rs 6.5 lakh crore) industry, with the private sector balancing investor returns and social responsibility, while the public sector is struggling with inadequate faculty and outdated curriculum. greece, for instance, imposed a 23 per cent value added tax (vat) on private educational establishments in 2015. ""it looked like a double win that would simultaneously please creditors and demonstrate the government's commitment to helping the underprivileged. unsurprisingly, it did neither,"" the economist reported on october 30, 2015. within months, reasonably priced private schools were forced to shut down. those who suffered as a consequence were not just the rich but also middle- and lower-income groups. private schools located in working class areas charged affordable tuition fees and attracted working class parents who were keen their children receive a good education. the vat also strained an already overheated state education system. in india, as in greece, the demand for private schooling is not just reflective of elite preferences but also a show of trust in affordable private schools, thereby making the demand cut across income spectrums. for instance, about 31 per cent of children in india in 2015-2016 were enrolled in private schools, while about 11.5 per cent were enrolled in private institutions partly aided by the government, according to data from the unified district information system for education. even in some poorer states such as uttar pradesh (51.37 per cent) and rajasthan (49.23), half of all children enrolled were in private educational institutions. though parents believe private schools offer higher quality education, government schools in some states have also improved over the last two years. further, a 2014 study suggested that children who study in private schools were more likely to have educated parents (which could result in better learning outcomes), have fewer siblings and thus receive more parental attention, and be part of families richer than those who study in government schools. if the government chooses to tax private education at the lowest slab rate (about 5 per cent), while also considering the tax already paid on inputs such as furniture and services (like rent), the effective tax rate would be even lower. careful framing of the law, i.e. the rate of tax and allowance of input tax credit with respect to education, could mitigate the impact of taxing education, and result in an increase in cost of education to the consumer by just about 2-3 per cent. —ians","taxed gst , private education could cost 3 %","new delhi , march 31 private education could cost 2-3 per cent taxed lowest slab 5 per cent goods services tax ( gst ) , according analysis bill ' provisions. gst bill passed lok sabha ( lower house parliament ) march 29 , carries provision says certain services provided government local authority would liable tax. ; ( follow tribune facebook ; twitter @thetribunechd ) financial experts believe provision inserted exempt education health services , addition list services , provided government local authority. provision could extrapolated mean private education india would liable tax gst becomes law. tax exemptions granted public private institutions engaged providing education. extending exemption benefits private schools , considering commercial success , always idea found mass support.

advertisements will become costlier in the upcoming gst regime but education and health care will remain exempted from tax. the all-powerful gst council on friday finalised tax rates for services under the new regime set to kick in from july 1, earmarking an 18 per cent rate for telecom and financial services, which include banking and insurance, up from current 15 per cent. though the government insisted that tax incidence will be same as the current if telecom companies claim input tax credit, industry associations said, adding that tax as a principal is billed in actuals to consumers and any increase in incidence will result in rise in cost to them. ; read: ‘gst will drive consumption of fmcg products’ ‘gst rates unlikely to hurt inflation, rbi to be less hawkish’ briefing reporters after the two-day meeting, finance minister arun jaitley said transport services will be taxed at 5 per cent, leading to a small drop in the economy class air travel which currently attracts 6 per cent service tax. non-ac train travel, including on local trains and the metro, as well as religious travel, including the haj yatra, will remain exempted from gst. five per cent rate will also apply on rides from cab aggregators like ola and uber, which currently pay 6 per cent tax. ac train travel will attract 5 per cent service tax, same as freight levy. the gst council finalised four tax rates of 5, 12, 18 and 28 per cent for services, including telecom, insurance, hotels and restaurants, under the biggest tax reform since independence. the rates are in line with those finalised for goods. with this, rates of all items except a handful, including gold, have been decided ahead of the rollout of the goods and services tax (gst) regime from july 1. space selling for advertisement in newspapers will attract 5 per cent levy under the gst. it is exempted from tax currently. jaitley said telecom and financial services will be taxed at a standard rate of 18 per cent. revenue secretary hashmukh adhia insisted that the tax incidence on telecom services will be unchanged at 15 per cent after the input credit is taken on equipment. but cellular operators association of india (coai) rajan mathews said: “you have to differentiate between impact of gst on companies and consumers. companies may or may not structure their tariff as per provision of refund but customers will have to pay 18 per cent tax every time bill is generated, so consumers will be hit under the gst.” while the economy class air travel will attract 5 per cent gst, the business class will be charged at 12 per cent. jaitley said non-ac restaurants will charge 12 per cent gst on food bill. the tax rate for ac restaurants and those with liquor licence will be 18 per cent, while five-star hotels will charge 28 per cent gst. restaurants with rs 50 lakh or below turnover will go under the 5 per cent composition, he said. work contracts like white washing will be liable for a 12 per cent gst. entertainment tax will be merged with service tax under the gst and a composite 28 per cent levy charged on cinema services as well as gambling and betting at race course. while the rate proposed for cinema halls is lower than 40 to 55 per cent currently, it may not result in a reduction in tariffs on cinema tickets as states continue to hold right to levy local charges on them. hotels and lodges charging per day tariff of rs 1,000 will be exempt from gst. the rates for hotels with tariff of rs 1,000 to rs 2,000 per day will be 12 per cent, while those with rs 2,500 to rs 5,000 will be 18 per cent. the gst for hotels with tariff above rs 5,000 will be 28 per cent. jaitley said tax on gold and precious metals will be taken up at the next meeting of the council on june 3. the rate on services was the main thing discussed at the gst meet today, he said, adding that most service tax exemptions will be grandfathered and will continue. the net effect of the gst will not be inflationary, he said, adding that health care and education services will continue to be exempted from tax under the gst. e-commerce players like flipkart, snapdeal will have to deduct 1 per cent tcs (tax collected at source) while making payments to suppliers, adhia said. no decision was taken on tax rate on lottery. jaitley said july 1 will be the rollout date for gst. “we are in state of readiness.” adhia warned the industry of changing rates before the gst rollout saying that under the anti-profiteering law, any entity can be called in to question for their actions after today. “my advice to all the big industry players would be that please don’t do this. let’s be honest, let us try to pass down the actual tax rate to the consumer and let’s not try to increase tariff only because of tax rate going up,” he said. the machinery for anti-profiteering will be operationalised soon, he said. he said once the anti profiteering machinery is set up, balance sheet of companies can be checked if any undue profit has been taken or any tax benefit has not been passed on. “we will look only at big companies. the department can suo motu take action,” he said. jaitley said, “as i said, we made sure that consumers don’t have to pay more. the net effect of goods and services is not going to be inflationary because, once the system of input credits starts the actual incidence is going to be positively impacted.” he said transport, covering goods, road, air and ac rail, has been kept in the 5 per cent category because its main input is petroleum products and since petroleum is outside gst, those paying service tax will not be able to take the benefit of input tax credit. “the services have been split into 12 and 18 per cent and some five services into 28 per cent category,” he said. jaitley said most of the work relating to the gst rollout has been completed and only a few things remain. the two-day meeting of the all-powerful gst council, its 14th so far, has decided on tax rates to be levied on various services under the gst regime. gst has been billed as the biggest tax reform since the independence and seeks to have uniform taxation for various goods and services across the country, uniting it as a single market by subsuming a plethora of state and central levies. pti","health care , education exempted gst : jaitley","srinagar , may 19 telephone bills ,

national market for goods and services by subsuming multiple taxes at the national and state level, thereby creating a paradigm of “one nation, one tax, one market”. president mukherjee said gst was a “disruptive change” and similar to the introduction of vat when there was initial resistance. “when a change of this magnitude is undertaken, however positive it may be, there are bound to be some teething troubles and difficulties in the initial stages,” he said. video courtesy: facebook handle of pib modi called the gst “good and simple tax” which would replace 500 kinds of different taxes prevalent in the country. showering praise and thanking political parties, modi said the gst was the result of combined efforts of all political parties and did not belong to any one party or one government. invoking the legacy of sardar patel, the prime minister said the gst would bring about economic integration of india similar to what was done by patel at the time of independence to integrate the states and the country. referring to the vision of new india, modi said the gst was the economic system of a new india and its scope was not limited to the financial system but now india would move in a new direction. the pm said under the new system due to an audit trail, the harassment of traders and small businesses will end while integrating india into one market with one tax rate. during the initial phase, he said that doubts and anxiety should not be spread and even small traders will adapt to the new system. he added that gst will end generation of black money and corruption, promote new governance culture and help to garner resources for the welfare of the poor. talking about the teething troubles, the pm said even eyes had to adjust for some days when once wears new spectacles. in his address, mukherjee said the central tax was a “tribute” to the maturity and wisdom of india’s democracy, as he recalled steps taken during his own tenure as finance minister on this key reform measure. “the new era in taxation is the result of a broad consensus arrived at between the centre and states. this consensus took not only time but also effort to build. the effort came from persons across the political spectrum who set aside narrow partisan considerations and put the nation’s interests first. it is a tribute to the maturity and wisdom of india’s democracy,” mukherjee said. he said the gst council should continuously review the implementation and suggest improvements to the taxation regime. after the gst launch, the government imposed levy of 10 per cent basic customs duty on mobile phones, which make imported phones expensive, while inputs and raw materials for manufacture are exempt. momentous event: pranab it is a momentous event for

""there are 22 items where the gst council has decided to keep tax in 5 per cent bracket. the reason for this is not to do disservice to them — it is to help them that we have kept it at 5 per cent. under gst, the first principle is there should not be any cascading of taxation,"" he told a media briefing. ; if the tax rate was kept at zero, no refund to domestic manufacturer would have been available for the 18 per cent tax on inputs and raw material he used and so the goods would have been loaded with that cost as compared to current 5 per cent, he said.

2017-07-10,up assembly budget session from tuesday,"lucknow, july 10 the budget session of the uttar pradesh assembly begins on tuesday with presentation of the bjp government’s first annual budget, even as opposition parties gear up to corner chief minister yogi adityanath on the law and order front and other issues. the session, which will conclude on july 28, is likely to witness fireworks with the opposition congress planning to raise the issue of crime and farmers’ problems. “from agra to kushinagar, farmers have committed suicide due to loan burden but the state government has failed to come out with a clear policy of loan waiver,” congress legislature party leader ajay pratap lallu told pti here. “we will also raise the issue of deteriorating law and order,” he said. in a similar vein, samajwadi party spokesman rajendra chaudhary said his party will vociferously raise the issue of “rising crime graph” across the state besides “burning issues” facing the poor, especially farmers. ; both the congress and the sp have decided to highlight the objections raised by traders against the gst regime, noting the tax on some of the items will be fatal for small and medium enterprises. the bsp too will seek to pillory the government on a host of issues, especially on the law and order front, a senior party leader said. according to the schedule approved by speaker hridaynath dixit, the session will have 14 sittings. separate days have been earmarked for discussion on the 2017-18 budget and the budgetary provisions for departments before passage. the previous akhilesh yadav government had in december last year presented a vote on account for the period ending july 31 this year. other than the budget, the house will transact some legislative business as well. the bjp and its allies have a massive strength of 325 in the 403-member house, while the opposition has only 74 mlas. the very first session of uttar pradesh assembly after the bjp stormed to power in march had witnessed ruckus by opposition parties which protested with placards and threw papers balls at governor ram naik over the law and order situation in the state. the assembly was last in session in may, during which the state gst (goods and services tax) bill was passed unanimously. the 2017-18 budget is expected to include measures to mop up additional resources to offload rs 36,000 crore meant for crop loan waiver to benefit nearly 86 lakh small and marginal farmers, and rs 34,000 crore required to meet expenses for implementation of the seventh pay panel’s recommendations and some other major commitments made in its election manifesto. this is for the first time that the state government will need such a big amount of additional funds in a financial year. the state’s total indebtedness is estimated to have increased from rs 2,25,123.59 crore in 2012-13 to rs 3,75,049.45 crore as on march 31 this year, according to official data. additional borrowings might make funding for development projects more difficult as the state government spends about half of its revenue receipts on payment of salaries, pension and debt services. the expenditure on payment of salaries, pension and debt services is estimated to have reached 51.7 per cent on march 31 against estimated 49.1 per cent in 2015-16. the chief minister has already said the state government will not pass on the burden of loan waiver to the people by imposing new taxes. instead, it will meet the cost by cutting down wasteful expenditure. adityanath has said the state government will carry out all its programmes by minimising its expenses and not by imposing any tax burden on people. he said his government’s decision to scrap 15 public holidays in the name of prominent personalities was already projected to save rs 50,000 crore of state revenue annually. the chief minister reasoned that state gross domestic product (gdp) was to the tune of rs 12 lakh crore, which comes to rs 1 lakh crore per month. by scrapping 15 holidays, the state government would be able save rs 50,000 crore through maximum utilisation of manpower. he has also said that the state government intends to save funds in the health sector by roping in ambulances provided by the centre free of cost. to fund the loan waiver, the state cabinet has decided to float kisan rahat bonds for raising rs 36,359 crore required for waiving loans of small and marginal farmers who form 92.5 per cent of the total 2.30 lakh farmers in the state. they had suffered because of successive drought and hailstorm. rs 30,729 crore was required for waiving loans of small and marginal farmers. besides, there were about 7 lakh other farmers who had taken loans which turned into non-performing assets (npas). in order to bring them back into the mainstream, their outstanding dues of rs 5,630 crore have also been written off. the state government has also decided to take a loan of rs 16,580 crore from public sector financial institutions like hudco, nabard, rural electrification corporation and power finance corporation for development projects like laying of roads, upgrading of highways, construction of expressway, rural housing and urban development besides strengthening of power distribution network. — pti ",assembly budget session tuesday,"lucknow , july 10 budget session

2017-07-10,vaghela in catch 22 situation,"manas dasgupta a joke is doing the rounds in media circles in gujarat: “once the confusion over the gst and shankarsinh vaghela is over, it will be relaxation time.” but if anything, some 10 days after the gst rollout, opposition against it is getting more intense and the confusion over the congress leader’s next move more deep. apparently, the former cm is not clear where he is headed to. by making allegations against the party’s state and central leadership, vaghela seems to have burnt his fingers in the congress and the bjp has rocked his boat within the party. if the thought of launching a party ever crossed his mind, he seems to have given up any such move. his personal equation with the voters is no better than what it was some 20 years ago when he launched the rashtriya janata dal after quitting the bjp. he managed to win just seven seats in the assembly in the 1998 elections and was forced to merge his rjd with the congress a year later. vaghela fully understands that contesting against both the bjp and the congress could only be disastrous, with little chance of his becoming a king or a king-maker. vaghela is valuable for any party for his “political acumen” that is as good as that of pm narendra modi. his contact with the people at the grass-root level since his rss days is still alive and could be a boon for any big party. but vaghela may have overestimated his value in the congress before launching a scathing attack on the party’s central leadership last week, warning that he would quit the party “if it failed to mend its ways.” as if echoing bjp leaders, vaghela called the congress a “sinking ship” and cautioned that he would “disembark from the ship if it continues to rush towards definite destruction.” denying he had any cm ambitions, he said going by his experiences in 2007 and 2012, it would not be easy to defeat the bjp in gujarat, unless the congress was “well-prepared” for the battle. ; vaghela believes the congress has a good chance of a gujarat victory, given the political situation in the state in the wake of the patel agitation, dalit’s dislike for the bjp because of gau rakshaks, discontent among the tribals and obcs and the general sentiment in favour of “change.” but this, he says, can happen only if the is “well prepared.” hinting that he might cause a split in the party, if it does not change its style of functioning, vaghela said at a workers’ meeting last week :”i can clearly see that the party can win in gandhinagar this time but you neither want to prepare nor let anyone prepare...it appears that you have taken ‘supari’ (strike a deal) from the bjp to deliberately lose the elections. it seems the party’s central leadership had not learnt any lesson from its abject defeat in uttar pradesh.” he went on to say that he might “re-think” on his remaining with the congress. “in 2002 i had promised congress president sonia gandhi that i will always be loyal to the party, but that promise has now ended. i have informed soniaji about this a few days ago. i told rahul that there are some who want to push me out of the party, and he agreed this was true,” he said. vaghela made it clear that he would not want to be party in-charge of the election campaign unless he was given a free hand to select candidates and take steps to rejuvenate the election machinery. sources say the party leadership is not amused at vaghela’s outbursts and unlikely to give-in to his “arm-twisting tactics.” with its goal of creating a rift in the state congress achieved, the bjp has begun ignoring vaghela’s feelers for his return to the mother organisation. in the absence of any other option, vaghela may be forced to stay in the congress, but a half-hearted vaghela may only make it easier for the bjp to retain power. vhp against modi the war of attrition between the pm and his one-time pal pravin togadia, international president of the vishwa hindu parishad, is no more a secret. it was further underlined when the central governing council of the vhp met at vadtal town in central gujarat last week and adopted several resolutions, criticising the functioning of the modi government. even as modi is trying to obliterate his anti-muslim image, the vhp asked the centre to abolish the union ministry of minority affairs and the national commission for minorities (ncm). the vhp joint general secretary (international), surendra jain, explained that the provocation for the resolution was the recent move by the ncm to start a helpline for muslims to report “atrocities”. jain said the vhp believed that such a move create a “misleading impression” that atrocities against the muslims were on the rise. the vhp believes there is no need for a separate commission for the minorities when the national human rights commission took care of all citizens, including the minorities. “the ncm clearly is trying to encourage separatism by promoting a helpline number only for muslims. there is no need for maintaining a parallel authority in the name of religion when the nhrc exists and the ncm as well as the ministry of minorities should be scrapped,” the resolution said. the vhp also countered modi on cow vigilantes, accused by him as “part-time rogues”, claiming they were “law-abiding patriotic nationals” whose image was being tarnished through “public humiliation” to give a free hand to cow slaughterers.

""in the national interest, we are not afraid of taking big and tough decisions because for us, the country is above politics. whether it be the surgical strikes, demonetisation or gst, all decisions were taken without any fear or hesitation,"" modi told the gathering. referring to the note ban, the prime minister said the step was taken to curb black money and that it had helped identify lakhs of people who had crores of rupees in bank accounts but never paid income tax. ; he also said registration of over two lakh companies had been cancelled in last three months as those had been found to be indulging in laundering of black money. ""to deal with corruption, we banned currency notes of rs 500 and rs 1000 denomination. a handful of corrupt people were making 125 crore people pay for their misdeeds. this was not acceptable to us,"" modi said in 35-minute address.

targeting the prime minister’s critics, he said modi had ruffled several feathers by his action against the corrupt and status quo—“after all, years of privilege of a select few are now over and the poor are now getting their due”. recalling his decades-long association with modi, he said the prime minister had never celebrated his birthday. shah added that service or ‘sewa’ was the best way to celebrate the birthday of ‘pradhan sewak’ modi. modi’s heart, he said, “beats for the poor, downtrodden, marginalised and the farmers of india”. shah added that the pm’s deep concern for their welfare had motivated him to immerse himself in nation building from a very young age. “india first is a belief that narendra bhai has lived at every point of his life,” shah wrote. people saw modi as a compassionate leader, he said. “they see him as their own, a person working round the clock for their and the nation’s welfare, without any self interest. his popularity has transcended all boundaries,” the bjp chief said. he added that he first met modi as a young bjp worker and neither of them was drawn to power as the saffron party then was far from the force it later became. what mattered, he said, was that they devoted every moment of their time for india’s welfare. “we will continue to serve the nation and support him (modi) as he takes india to new heights of success and glory,” shah said citing the mudra scheme, jan dhan accounts, surgical strikes and demonetisation to underline modi’s resolve and commitment to the country’s welfare. — pti ",modi achieving india ’ economic integration : amit shah,"new delhi , september 17 bjp president amit shah sunday bracketed prime minister narendra modi sardar patel br ambedkar said modi started india ’ economic integration patel ambedkar respectively achieved country ’ territorial social unification. lavishing praise modi 67th birthday , shah said pm ’ life many ways “personification spirit india ” claimed sensitivity towards aspirations poor led “historic poverty alleviation initiatives taking shape scale unheard history ” india. modi government , shah said , honest taxpayers , majority belonged middle class , felt valued following crackdowns black money corruption various measures , including demonetisation benami law. opposition parties sharpened criticism government ’ claims demonetisation rbi said 99 per cent old notes deposited banks bjp insisted increased transparency expanded formal economy. “india remembers sardar patel territorial integration nation recall role babasaheb ambedkar social integration. initiatives starting jan dhan yojana gst , narendra bhai set ball rolling economic integration india , ” shah said blog. ;

singh made a speech before answering a few questions at the event. “the economy has slowed down as i had projected a few months ago as a result of demonetisation and also the fact that demonetisation has been accompanied by the gst, which is a good thing that we have done in the long term. but in the short term, there are glitches that need to be resolved. therefore, the economy has experienced a downhill path,” he said. he said the gdp growth was much higher in the last quarter of 2016-17 than the first quarter of this financial year. there are certain things that need to be done immediately, singh said. “when we were in office, investment rate in the economy was 35-37 per cent but now it is less than 30 per cent. private investment in particular is not growing,” he said. he added that india needs much more investment in public sector “but we cannot rely exclusively on public sector to realise our development initiatives. we must also simultaneously work on a foreign exchange situation.” singh, who had served as the country’s finance minister over two decades back, said growth cannot take place at a high rate if banking system is not performing its task of providing money to entrepreneurs and to others who need to invest in our economy. responding to a question on healthcare, he said it is one of the areas where the country is not spending enough and not giving the required emphasis on preventive healthcare. although private sector has a role to play, the public health problems require strong leadership and this is one area where markets are important but not the final solution, he said. asked what he felt would be the role of the government in foreseeable future and its interactions with the private sector, singh said, “government in our country cannot be wished away.” he said public sector spending is only 30 per cent of the gdp, which is not too big compared to many other nations. infrastructure, public healthcare, agriculture are the areas where the government will remain important, he said. responding to a question on globalisation, singh said it is here to stay. despite what us president donald trump said in his election campaign, the american public opinion will prevail, he said. “also, i feel in europe too there is today recognition of multilateral trading system. china today has become a great champion of globalisation,” he said. asked if the us president was being protectionist, the former prime minister said, “i am quite confident the us president’s current thinking will not last more than a year or so.” — pti ","demonetisation required , warned : manmohan singh","mohali , september 22 former prime minister manmohan singh friday said economy “downhill path ” “adventure ” demonetisation undertaken last year required , either technically economically. singh , renowned economist considered architect reforms early 1990s , said demonetisation successful civilised country , except latin american nations. “i ’ think demonetisation required ... ’ think technically , economically necessary launch adventure , ” said indian school business ( isb ) leadership summit asked note ban decision right one. prime minister narendra modi announced november 8 last year scrapping rs 500 rs 1000 currency notes. said process involved withdrawing almost 86 per cent currency circulation “there bound fallout seeing. ” ;

we have merely denied them opportunity. we are eliminating poverty by investing in the poor. we are turning them from job-seekers into job-providers,” swaraj said. she said that all of the economic programmes—jan dhan, mudra, ujjwala, skill india, digital india, clean india, start-up india and stand-up india—have a principal purpose, the empowerment of the poor. “the jan dhan plan must surely count as the world’s largest financial inclusion scheme,” she said, adding that at least 300 million indians who had never crossed the doors of a bank today have bank accounts: this is equivalent to the population of the united states of america. “this was, understandably, not easy to complete in three years, but our banks, achieved this visionary goal set by our prime minister. while some remain to be included, the target has been set – every indian family will have a bank account,” she said, adding that these accounts were opened with zero balance. mudra yojana, she said, has enabled government to fund the unfunded. “those who had never dreamt that bank credit was within their options, today, through mudra, are getting soft loans without collateral to begin micro businesses,” she said. she said that over 70 per cent of these loans have gone to women. describing ujjwala a signature scheme of the government, swaraj said free gas cylinders are being provided to the poor so that women do not have to suffer the dangerous consequences of wood-fired kitchens. she said india has started, this year, the india-un development partnership fund, asserting that the country is completely engaged in fighting poverty. pti ",demonetisation courageous decision challenge black money : swaraj,"united nations , september 23 external affairs minister sushma swaraj saturday said demonetisation “courageous ” decision taken prime minister narendra modi challenge black money — one by-products corruption. prime minister modi november 8 , 2016 , demonetised rs 500 rs 1,000 notes bid clamp black money , fake currency menace , terror funding corruption. “demonetisation courageous decision challenge one by-products corruption , ‘black money ’ disappeared circulation , ” swaraj said address 72nd session united nations general assembly here. also said india passed goods services tax ( gst ) legislation , one tax across country , without untidy punishing system multiple taxes differing categories different parts india. “our ‘save girl , educate girl ’ campaign reducing gender inequality. clean india programme generating described revolutionary change social attitudes habits , ” said. ;

""there is a strong undercurrent in favour of congress in gujarat. people want change and congress will definitely come to power this time. people of gujarat are unhappy with the ruling party as they feel cheated after giving their votes to the bjp,"" said gandhi, adding that congress will help gujarat develop. the congress is out of power in gujarat for over two decades. the 47-year-old congress leader, who started the day by offering prayers at the famous dwarkadhish temple in dwarka, interacted with people during his trip from the holy city to jamnagar, passing through saurashtra region. ; in his short speeches at various places, gandhi assailed modi over demonetisation and a host of other issues. he highlighted the issue of unemployment under the bjp dispensation and promised to solve the problems faced by gujarat's farmers if his party is voted to power in the state. travelling in an especially-designed bus, he interacted with villagers at many places. from dwarka, gandhi headed to hanjrapar, where he was accorded a traditional welcome by villagers. he even rode a bullock cart and interacted with villagers. gandhi came down heavily on gujarat's bjp government on the issue of privatisation.

""you go to any corner of this country and ask farmers whether they get proper price for their produce. all of them will promptly say, no,"" gandhi said. ""our prime minister narendra modi declared demonetisation without consulting anyone. this was a massive blow to our economy. ""farmers were badly hit as they do not do transaction through phone or debit card. they use cash to buy seeds or pay farm labourers,"" said gandhi. he claimed the goods and services tax (gst) has broken the back of small traders and shopkeepers. gandhi said though the congress told the government to have a single tax rate under the gst, it introduced five slabs. he claimed lakhs of businesses have shut down due to the gst. the poor have no place in the 'gujarat model' of development that has benefited only a handful of businessmen, the congress leader said.

(follow the tribune on facebook; and twitter @thetribunechd) in an article in the indian express, sinha, who was the finance minister in the atal bihari vajpayee government, said prime minister narendra modi “claims he has seen poverty from close quarters (and) his finance minister is working over-time to make sure that all indians also see it from equally close quarters”. read ; congress questions bjp on sinha's remarks on ‘financial mess' government taking economy in wrong direction: rss-affiliate labour outfit chidambaram lauds yashwant sinha for talking 'truth to power' india is fastest growing economy: bjp on sinha's criticism sinha said jaitley had been luckier than his predecessors to hold the ministry at a time when lakhs of crores of rupees were at his disposal following the depressed global crude oil prices. but he wasted the oil bonanza which “was waiting to be used imaginatively”. “the legacy problems like stalled projects and bank npas were no doubt there and should have been managed better... but the legacy problems have not only been allowed to persist, they have become worse.” illustrating the picture of the indian economy today, sinha said private investment has shrunk “as never before in two decades” while industrial production has all but collapsed. “agriculture is in distress, construction industry, a big employer of the work force, is in the doldrums, the rest of the service sector is also in the slow lane, exports have dwindled, sector after sector of the economy is in distress.” continuing his tirade against the government’s demonetisation decision, sinha said spiking large currency notes “has proved to be an unmitigated economic disaster” which coupled with “a badly conceived and poorly implemented gst” has played havoc with businesses and sunk many of them. “countless millions have lost their jobs with hardly any new opportunities coming the way of the new entrants to the labour market. for quarter after quarter, the growth rate of the economy has been declining until it reached the low of 5.7 per cent in the first quarter of the current fiscal.” he said if the government had not changed the methodology for calculation of the gdp in 2015, the growth rate of 5.7 per cent would have actually been 3.7 per cent or less—according to the old method of calculation. he came down heavily on the government’s view that the slowdown was for technical reasons and cited the sbi, the largest public sector bank of the country, as stating “with unusual frankness that the slowdown is not transient or ‘technical’, it is here to stay”. he said it was not difficult to anticipate the reasons for the slowdown and counter measures taken to deal with them. “but that called for devoting time to the task, serious application of mind, understanding of the issues and then working out a game plan to tackle them.” he noted that jaitley, who holds the department of disinvestment, and also held the ministries of defence (which was given to nirmala sitharaman in the last cabinet rejig) and corporate affairs, was carrying the heavy burden of so many extra responsibilities and it was “perhaps too much to expect from” him. “i have handled the ministry of finance and know how much hard work there is in that ministry alone. finance ministry, in the best of times, calls for the undivided attention of its boss if the job has to be properly done. in challenging times it becomes more than a 24/7 job. naturally, even a superman like jaitley could not do justice to the task.” sinha said he was speaking about the mess after realizing that “i shall be failing in my national duty if i did not speak up even now”. “i am also convinced that (it) reflects the sentiments of a large number of people in the bjp and elsewhere who are not speaking up out of fear.” he said the sme sector was suffering from an “unprecedented existential crisis”. “the input tax credit demand under the gst is a whopping rs 65,000 crore against a collection of rs 95,000 crore. the government has asked the income tax department to chase those who have made large claims. “cash flow problems have already arisen for many companies, specially in the sme sector. but this is the style of functioning of the finance ministry now. “we protested against raid raj when we were in opposition. today it has become the order of the day.” ians",yashwant sinha slams modi govt ’ economic policies,"new delhi , september 27 senior bjp leader yashwant sinha hard-hitting remarks lashed “superman ” finance minister arun jaitley making “mess ” indian economy headed “hard landing ” sector sector slipping distress.

2017-09-28,yashwant remains unfazed as son jayant joins issue over his criticism,"new delhi, september 28 bjp veteran yashwant sinha on thursday stuck to his guns after government's strong rebuttal of his stinging criticism of its handling of the economy over which union minister jayant sinha also joined issue with his father and stoutly defended the economic policies. an unfazed yashwant sinha, who had launched a blistering attack on the government, and the finance minister arun jaitley in particular, that set off a political storm, hoped the centre would do some course correction. follow the tribune on facebook; and twitter @thetribunechd) bjp mp shatrughan sinha also waded into the row over yashwant sinha's critique of the economy and came out in support of his senior party colleague, saying he was a true statesman and had shown the government the mirror. yashwant sinha, a former finance minister in the vajpayee government, also said he had sought an appointment with prime minister narendra modi last year so he could flag the issues, which he did through an article in a national english daily —the indian express—but got none. ; in the article, he spoke of the ""mess the finance minister has made of the economy."" “i found the doors were shut for me. therefore, i had no option but to speak up (in media) and air my views. i am confident i have worthwhile suggestions to make (to the prime minister),” the 84-year-old ias officer-turned-politician told national tv channels. yashwant sinha said any government of the day “should listen” when people like former prime minister manmohan singh or ex-union finance minister p chidambaram, considered experts on financial matters, speak up, and advised against dismissing their views as “political rhetoric”. the bjp leader, without naming the previous upa government, said it ""cannot be blamed"" for the tardy implementation of central projects as the nda has been in power for the last 40 months. in what is seen as a counter to his father’s attack on the bjp-led nda government's handling of the economy, jayant sinha, the minister of state for civil aviation, made a stout defence of the government's economic policies. jayant sinha said several articles have been written on the challenges facing the indian economy. “unfortunately, these articles draw sweeping conclusions from a narrow set of facts, and quite simply miss the fundamental structural reforms that are transforming the economy,” jayant sinha said in an op-ed article in the times of india. “moreover, one or two quarters of gdp growth and other macro data are quite inadequate to evaluate the long-term impact of the structural reforms underway,” he said. jayant sinha also said these structural reforms were not just desirable, they were necessary to create a 'new india' and provide good jobs. “the new economy that is being created will be much more transparent, globally cost-competitive, and innovation driven. importantly, the new economy will also be much more equitable, thereby enabling all indians to lead better lives,” he said. jayant sinha also claimed that the structural reforms unleashed by the modi government since 2014 constitute the third generation of reforms, after the first in 1991 and the second in 1999-2004 nda government. referring to his son's defence of the government, yashwant sinha sought to know why jayant was shifted from the finance ministry “if he was so competent” to answer the concerns raised by him. jayant sinha was shifted out of the finance ministry in july last year. “there is a decline in the growth rate quarter after quarter. i decided to speak up when the problems in the economy were multiplying...i hope the government even now will take steps to correct the situation which has arisen.” yashwant sinha said the purpose behind highlighting the concerns about the economy through an article was to bring certain issues in public domain so that the government does a course correction. he said he did not expect his article to create ""such a furore"". yashwant sinha said both he and his son were doing their “dharma” (duty). he insisted that the issue should not be seen as one between ""father and son"". ""if someone has asked him (jayant) to write the piece, then it is a cheap trick to play...i have not spoken to him (on the issue). will do it some time to find out (what exactly happened),"" he added. the congress raised questions over jayant sinha’s claims that “structural reforms” by the modi government would create a 'new india'. describing jayant sinha's article as a ""pib press release"", congress leader and former finance minister p chidambaram said jayant should know that administrative changes were not structural reforms.

""(we had said)...wherever there are problems in these three months, as in the areas of management, shortage of technology, problems related to rules, complaints regarding rates, trouble in practical experience of business class, we will address it,"" he said. ‘don’t want business class to get caught in red-tape’ maintaining that he does not want the business class to get caught in red tape, the prime minister said based on the information the government had, finance minister arun jaitley convinced everyone at the gst council meet yesterday about the need for altering some of its provisions. ""i am happy that it has been welcomed in one voice across the country,"" modi said. when there is trust in the government and honesty is seen behind decisions the country joins in despite difficulties, the prime minister said. ""i can experience this and i am thankful to the people of the country for the way they have welcomed our effort to make simple tax simpler,"" modi said. three months after the roll-out of the new indirect tax regime, the goods and services tax council yesterday made sweeping changes to give relief to small and medium businesses on filing and payment of taxes, eased rules for exporters and cut tax rates on more than two dozen items. under attack over the gujarat model of development, modi took a swipe at the congress over economic progress under its governments, saying for them it meant installing a hand pump and asking for votes in return. ""the definition of development has changed. earlier, leaders used to install a hand pump and ask for vote in its name for three elections,"" modi said without naming the congress. he was addressing a gathering after laying the foundation stone for a greenfield airport at hirasar near temple town of chotila in surendranagar district. ""there is no substitute for development. everybody, even a very poor person, wants development. if you ask any poor person if he wants a house, he would say yes. you cannot give houses to the poor without development,"" modi said. earlier, addressing the dwarka gathering, modi said, said, ""when madhavsinh solankiji was (gujarat) cm, i recall front page advertisements -- 'cm coming to jamnagar to inaugurate a water tank'. this is how narrow their concept of development was."" ""we have come a long way since then and we are looking at more all-round and extensive progress,"" modi said. addressing a gathering of iit students in gandhinagar, the prime minister called for steps to bridge the digital divide, while emphasising on innovation. modi said his government has launched a programme under which one member of each of the 6 crore families living in villages would be made digitally empowered. ""in this day and age, we cannot afford to have a digital divide. if some are empowered in technology and some not, this digital divide can create a big problem for social harmony,"" he said, adding digital literacy was an important element in ensuring good governance and transparency. the prime minister said his government has blended jam -- jandhan account, aadhaar and mobile phone -- to ensure people become digitally literate. advising the iits to create a culture of innovation which is need based and not knowledge based, modi said if innovations are made keeping in mind the needs of people, companies would show interest in buying them. while opening his speech, modi remembered his childhood days when he sold tea at the railway station in his hometown vadnagar. ""you all are iitians. but i am the one who is just a 'teaian', a chaiwala"" modi said, evoking laughter from the audience. — pti ",diwali arrived fortnight early : pm modi gst tweak,"dwarka/chotila/gandhinagar , october 7 prime minister narendra modi saturday said yesterday ' changes gst regime giving relief small medium businesses hailed across country kindled festive mood diwali fortnight celebrated. poll-bound home state gujarat third time less month , modi launched inaugurated plethora projects , slammed congress questioning state ' development model. also made strong pitch bridging digital divide , calling digital literacy important element good governance transparency.

2017-10-07,government wasted gst chance to put india on growth path: congress,"new delhi, october 7 the congress on saturday accused the modi government of wasting an opportunity to put india on the growth path through gst, which it said should be a “good and simple tax” rather than a “grossly scary tax”. congress communications in-charge randeep surjewala said gst had failed to provide any real relief to the common man or to the farming and textile sectors, the biggest generators of employment in the country. “gst should not become a ‘grossly scary tax’. it should be a ‘good and simple tax’,” surjewala told reporters. labelling the government “amateurish and vision-less” and “drunk with arrogance”, he said it was wasting a golden opportunity to put india on a growth trajectory due to its “ineptitude and lack of comprehension of issues”. the stark truth is that the indian gst rate is now the highest in the world and the ‘one nation, one tax’ has become ‘one nation, seven taxes’ and more, the congress leader added. ; where was the real relief for the people? surjewala asked, and added that people wanted substance, not soothing words. prime minister narendra modi, bjp chief amit shah and finance minister arun jaitley had “forgotten” to give relief to the common man and two biggest employment generators — the agriculture and textiles sectors, which are in serious trouble. “this mammoth opportunity is being lost due to sheer incompetence of a panic stricken modi government driven by adhocism and lost in chaos of its own making,” he said. following the “disaster” of demonetisation, a possible “good fortune” of adding two percent to india’s gdp is being converted into “misfortune” by sheer ineptitude and amateurish handling of the most important tax-reform, he said. — pti ",government wasted gst chance put india growth path : congress,"new delhi , october 7 congress saturday accused modi government wasting opportunity put india growth path gst , said “good simple tax ” rather “grossly scary tax ” . congress communications in-charge randeep surjewala said gst failed provide real relief common man farming textile sectors , biggest generators employment country. “gst become ‘grossly scary tax ’ . ‘good simple tax ’ , ” surjewala told reporters. labelling government “amateurish vision-less ” “drunk arrogance ” , said wasting golden opportunity put india growth trajectory due “ineptitude lack comprehension issues ” . stark truth indian gst rate highest world ‘one nation , one tax ’ become ‘one nation , seven taxes ’ , congress leader added. ; real relief people ? surjewala asked , added people wanted substance , soothing words. prime minister narendra modi , bjp chief amit shah finance minister arun jaitley “forgotten ” give relief common man two biggest employment generators — agriculture textiles sectors , serious trouble. “this mammoth opportunity lost due sheer incompetence panic stricken modi government driven adhocism lost chaos making , ” said. following “disaster ” demonetisation , possible “good fortune ” adding two percent india ’ gdp converted “misfortune ” sheer ineptitude amateurish handling important tax-reform , said. — pti","{'bjp': 1, 'cong': 3}",3,1,0.018434343434343428

2017-10-08,"gst, demonetisation having desired impact: jaitley","washington, october 8 finance minister arun jaitley has said the government's initiatives like 'swachh bharat', goods and services tax (gst) and demonetisation are having desired impact, the latter two resulting in increasing tax compliance and squeezing quantum of cash in the economy. in his keynote address – via video conference -- to the berkeley india conference yesterday, jaitley said there is public support to the reforms being undertaken by the governments of the day both at the centre and state levels. ""i do hope that india is able to retain its growth rate once again and live up to the aspirations of its people because we must not forget that we not only have a large population to service, we have a very young population to service,"" he said. jaitley is scheduled to arrive in the us tomorrow on nearly a week-long visit to interact with the us corporate world in new york and boston and attend the annual meeting of international monetary fund and world bank in washington dc. with young population there is not only a perception that they are being 'under serviced', but also, they are becoming more and more aspirational, he said. ; ""time therefore is running against us,"" jaitley said. in the next one or two decades, if india has to take a challenge for moving into a higher economic group country, ""we have to grow at a much faster pace,"" he said. responding to a question, he refuted the impression that transformational initiatives like 'swachh bharat', gst and demonetisation have not resulted in any changes on the ground. ""would you say there are long term benefits and the country would have to wait for those? or is there any way to mitigate the problem being faced by the country,"" he was asked. a more serious analysis, he argued, would show that even within matter of months there is a short term positive impact of all these projects. while demonetisation and gst are having desired impact in terms of tax compliances and squeezing the quantum of cash in the economy, he said that for the first time, 'swachh bharat' campaign has brought to fore the importance of cleanliness. before demonetisation, indian norm was to live with a high cash economy, not paying taxes, ""you buy a property, you transact partly in cash, and in business you maintain two sets of accounts,"" he said. ""how can a country, which aims to be the fastest growing major economy in the world, which aspires to grow from a developing to a developed economy, continue with the normal of this type,"" he asked. and therefore, ""you need to shake the system"" in order to reduce the quantum of cash in india and therefore obviously to make it a more tax complaint society, he observed. cash itself involves several challenges. it leads to corruption and several other problems, he added. ""let's see for even those why say that there is no short- term advantage, has the number of tax payers in india immediately increased in the matter of months? the truth is, it has. has the digitisation transaction increased from rs 70 crores to rs 130 crores today, it almost doubled,"" he said. in the immediate aftermath of demonetisation, jaitley said there has been sharp reduction in insurgent and terror activities in states like jammu & kashmir and chhattisgarh. the terror funding itself has gotten squeezed, he said. ""you are having terrorist incidents (now), but the fact that you were finding 5,000-10,000 stone throwers being provided with money by the terrorist organisations, why is it that in the last 8-10 months it has not happened?"" he asked. moving on to gst, the minister said this has resulted in creation of a national tax structure. ""in the three months, you have all the check points in states disappeared, you have clear flow of goods and services which has started all over the country,"" he said. jaitley said the gst council has noted some challenges and it is taking steps to address them. gst, he said, has been a ""reasonable smooth transformation,"" but there is scope for improvement. ""i think in gst council we have succeeded in creating india's first federal institution,"" he said. the transition, he said, would be a far more successful experience which will plug the holes into india's taxation system. responding to questions, jaitley said the indian government wants to encourage startups. ""the obvious challenge to the country is to grow and grow fast. it has to grow at a much higher rate than we have been growing in recent history,"" he said, adding that the benefits of the growth must also reach that section of the population which till date has been the least serviced one. observing that conventionally india was a far more difficult place to do business, he said that situation has substantially improved for the better. identifying corruption as one of the two stigmas for india, jaitley said the institutional mechanism to fight corruption has become much stronger. asserting that direct taxes have to become ""more rational and more reasonable"" jaitley said he has already announced a roadmap to bring down the corporate tax to about 25 per cent and is trying to ensure that india becomes a far more compliance society and also tax assessment is more technology driven rather than human interaction. — pti ","gst , demonetisation desired impact : jaitley","washington , october 8 finance minister arun jaitley said government ' initiatives like ' swachh bharat ' , goods services tax ( gst ) demonetisation desired impact , latter two resulting increasing tax compliance squeezing quantum cash economy. keynote address – via video conference -- berkeley india conference yesterday , jaitley said public support reforms undertaken governments day centre state levels.

2017-10-09,our diwali going up in smoke: shopkeepers after cracker ban,"new delhi, october 9 news of the supreme court order decreeing a cracker-free diwali this year spread like the proverbial wildfire through wholesale markets here on monday, uniting shopkeepers big and small in their anger and dismay. with losses running into crores, their diwali was going up in smoke, said shopkeepers in sadar bazaar and jama masjid, two of the biggest cracker markets in the city. the news travelled fast in the narrow bylanes of the two markets in the old city with shops piled high with crackers of all kinds, ranging from sparklers selling for about rs 20 a stick to powerful bombs going up to rs 1,000 and more. the supreme court said its order of last november banning the sale of firecrackers in delhi-national capital region (ncr) would continue till october 31 -- diwali falls on october 19 -- in an effort to check pollution this festival of lights. ""all dealers across ncr have been affected. the ban was imposed in 2016 last year and was lifted temporarily around 20 days back. now, what will be done with the old stock? crackers worth crores will go waste,” said amit jain, who sells firecrackers in jama masjid. ; harjit singh chhabra, head, sadar nishkarm welfare association, estimated that losses could go up to hundreds of crores. according to him, 500 temporary licences have already been issued to sell firecrackers in delhi-ncr. of these, sadar bazaar has 24. this does not include those who have a permanent licence. ""ban nuclear weapons, not crackers,"" said one shopkeeper in sadar bazaar. ""the supreme court's job is to regulate not ban,"" added another who had set up shop close by. ""they have banned diwali in delhi,"" said a third. the posters came up equally rapidly. a banner saying ""patake hi patake"" was pulled down to make way for a new one declaring, ""nashe se mar rahe hai log, patakon se nahi (people are dying because of drugs, not of crackers"". ""we are selling crackers not nuclear weapons that you impose a ban. this is india, not taliban that you can go on banning things like this,"" chhabra told pti. shopkeepers in sadar bazaar have threatened to go on strike and insist they won't follow the order. ""we can't sell in shops so we will sell on the pavement if nothing works out,"" chhabra said, addressing a crowd that had gathered near his shop. ""this is not child's play. they have revoked the old ban only to bring it again. what do we do with these crackers that we bought,"" he added, showing his licence giving him permission to sell crackers till november 21. his story found wide echo in the area. sandeep mahajan, another shopkeeper from sadar bazaar, said he has over 600 kg of crackers worth about rs 8 lakh. ""my losses will be three times more. i had bought crackers worth rs 25 lakh,"" added rajiv saxena of rk enterprises. many of them said they were just getting over the blow of ""28 per cent gst on crackers"". ""we are clueless about what to do next! for us diwali is finished. the last i knew, supreme court was authorised to regulate, not ban. this will only create new avenues for corruption. i can already see policemen taking rounds to harass us,"" said surinder chawla. while environmentalists and others welcomed the apex court order, chawla is amongst those hoping that the biggies of sivakasi -- firecracker manufacturing hub -- manage to get a stay. ""people running the industry in sivakasi are big shots. they will get us out of this situation,"" chawla said. the ""cracker lobby"" also contests that a ban would help in reducing pollution.

2017-10-13,taking india-us trade to $500 bn not a distant dream: jaitley," washington, october 13 the goal of increasing the annual trade between the us and india to usd 500 billion is not a “distant dream” given the opportunities that new delhi offers to american companies, particularly in aviation and defence sectors, finance minister arun jaitley has said. jaitley said the relationship between india and the us had evolved into a very strong partnership in the last few years and goals like ‘mission-500’ outlined and re-emphasised the objective of the partnership. “if one sees the opportunities that the defence and aviation sector in itself offers, increasing annual bilateral trade to usd 500 billion is not a distant dream,” he told a washington audience on thursday when asked if the usd 500 billion bilateral trade target was achievable. according to the united states trade representative (ustr) figures, india was us’ ninth largest trading partner with the total two-way trade of usd 67.7 billion last year. ; it is loaded in favour of india, which runs a surplus of usd 24 billion. jaitley said a lot of us companies had made investments in india and now a lot of indian companies felt comfortable in making investments in america. “it is an exercise which requires to be taken forward,” he said at an event organised by the federation of indian chambers of commerce and industries held at the headquarters of the international monetary fund. jaitley said one of the suggestions which was mooted in the meeting with us commerce secretary wilbur ross was that the two countries must get back governmental participation in private sector conferences. for the first time a different concept is taking place in november when a large number of american businesses are travelling to india for the global entrepreneurship (ges), he said, adding that the exercise would probably be repeated in the us next year. “this would provide a great opportunity for indian businesses here,” jaitley said. he said over the next decade or so india’s aviation sector is all set for a huge expansion. “us companies are a natural investor in that particular sector,” he said. “we have taken a huge initiative in the defence sector and we want these companies in partnership with indian companies to set up manufacturing facilities in india itself,” jaitley said. responding to a question on land and labour reforms, jaitley said they were not an immediate problem to the reform process started by the government in these two sectors. “we have allowed the state governments to make whatever necessary changes they want to make in land acquisition laws,” he said. noting that the labour problem is overstated in india, jaitley said the age of workers’ strike is long over in india. there has not been any hurdle of substantial nature in several areas, for instance the reforms in the banking and aviation sectors, he said, adding that in the last three and a half years, the government had been broadly sticking to the fiscal deficit targets. “we have realised the merit of trying to stick to that,” he said. the government was on target on direct tax, jaitley said, asserting that on gst, it was too early to discover a pattern because of a transition phase. “our priority is to include fiscal prudence at a very high level,” he said. jaitley said the government was trying to address the problem of non-performing asset on a very high priority. “this has two aspects. one is to recover what is recoverable. for this the government has created new laws, amended laws and have created new machinery, which will probably take care of it,” he said. jaitley said there was a need to strengthen public sector banks so that their ability to lend in india is maintained. this issue is at a high priority area for the government, he noted. “i can tell you that when you undertake structural reform of this kind, there could obviously be short-term impact, one quarter, for two quarters or so. “but these transient impacts should not be construed as any form of a long-term challenge because i do see that the med-term and long-term impact of all these changes is certainly going to be very positive,” jaitley said while responding to a question on stimulus. pti ",taking india-us trade $ 500 bn distant dream : jaitley,"washington , october 13 goal increasing annual trade us india usd 500 billion “distant dream ” given opportunities new delhi offers american companies , particularly aviation defence sectors , finance minister arun jaitley said. jaitley said relationship india us evolved strong partnership last years goals like ‘mission-500 ’ outlined re-emphasised objective partnership. “if one sees opportunities defence aviation sector offers , increasing annual bilateral trade usd 500 billion distant dream , ” told washington audience thursday asked usd 500 billion bilateral trade target achievable. according united states trade representative ( ustr ) figures , india us ’ ninth largest trading partner total two-way trade usd 67.7 billion last year. ;

2017-10-31,india jumps 30 ranks to 100th in world bank's ease of doing business list,"new delhi, october 31 india has jumped 30 places to rank 100th in the world bank's 'ease of doing business' ranking, helped by a slew of reforms in taxation, licensing, investor protection and bankruptcy resolution. the ranking comes as a shot in the arm for the narendra modi government amid dissenting voices in certain quarters about implementation of the goods and services tax (gst) as well as demonetisation. in its annual report 'doing business 2018: reforming to create jobs', the world bank said that india's ranking reflects nearly half of the 37 reforms, adopted since 2003, implemented in the last four years. the ranking, however, does not take into account business environment post implementation of gst, which weaved the country of 1.3 billion into one market with one tax and removed inter-state barriers for trade. india, which was ranked 130th among the 190 nations, is ""one of the top 10 improvers in this year's assessment, having implemented reforms in 8 out of 10 'doing business' indicators,"" it said. this is the first time india has broken into top 100 nations. ; india is the only large country this year to have achieved such a significant shift. the parameters that witnessed improvement in 2016-17 were india making it faster for start business, reduction in procedures and time required to obtain building permit, easier access to credit, protecting minority investors, ease of paying taxes, trading across borders, enforcing contracts and making resolving insolvency easier, the world bank said. but it still lags in areas such as starting a business, enforcing contracts and dealing with construction permits. it takes 30 days now to register a new business, down from 127 days 15 years ago, but ""the number of procedures is still cumbersome for local entrepreneurs who still need to go through 12 procedures"", it said. ""this is a major major jump,"" rita ramalho, acting director for world bank's global indicators group, said in washington, attributing the climb of 30 places to the series of reforms undertake by the modi government since 2014. the gst, which was implemented from july 1, will get reflected only in next year's 'ease of doing business' report. ""gst reforms have not been counted this year. it would come into play for the report next year,"" ramalho said, adding that demonetisation was not covered. india was ranked 130th for last two years. in 2014, it managed to get 142nd spot. according to the world bank, new zealand is the easiest place on the planet to do business, followed by singapore, denmark, south korea and hong kong. the us and the uk are ranked 6th and 7th on the list. among brics countries, russia tops the list with 35th position, followed by china which has retained its ranking at the 78th place for the second consecutive year. the biggest surprise of this year, the authors of the report said, is india, which jumped 30 spots in one year by improving its score by 4.71 to 60.76 points. ""india has improved a lot (this year), but there's still room for improvement, so, i wouldn't necessarily classify it as a nice place to do business yet, but definitely is in the right direction to become a nice place. it is much easier than it was two years ago,"" ramalho said. santiago croci downes, acting manager, doing business unit at world bank, said that in the 15 years' history of this annual report, there have been only five countries like georgia and rwanda, which made a massive jump in one year. but none of them were as big an economy as india. noting that india made a very big effort in the past two years, the world bank said the results now reflect those initiatives. ""this is a continuous effort of two or three years. but there's still a long way to go,"" she said. india used to be in the bottom quarter of the distribution, now it's in the middle, which is a big improvement. ""it (india) is still a place where there is room for improvement in making the life of entrepreneurs, less bureaucratic, making transactions simpler and more efficient and less costly. so, there's still significant room for improvement. but it was a very significant change and even not just in relative but also in absolute terms,"" she said. for entrepreneurs in india, doing business is simpler now, she argued. referring to the series of reforms being carried out by india, downs said there is a willingness to improve the private sector and prioritise these.

(follow the tribune on facebook; and twitter @thetribunechd) the council may on friday rationalise rates in sectors where the total incidence of taxation has gone up because the goods were either exempt from excise or attracted lower vat rates under the previous indirect tax regime. as the council tries to accommodate industry concerns on tax rates, after estimating the impact on revenue, a rationalisation of items in the 28 per cent tax bracket is expected. “most of the daily-use items like shampoo could be lowered to 18 per cent. tax rate on items like furniture, electric switches and plastic pipes could be relooked at,” an official said. besides, making the composition scheme more attractive is on the agenda and as per the group of ministers’ (gom) recommendations, the council may decide to allow businesses in inter-state trade to opt for the arrangement. the gom had also suggested slashing tax rate to 1 per cent for manufacturers and restaurants opting for the scheme from 2 per cent and 5 per cent, respectively. it was in favour of doing away with the tax rate distinction between ac and non-ac restaurants, those which are not covered under the composition scheme and tax them at a flat 12 per cent. currently, non-ac restaurants are taxed at 18 per cent. it also suggested that eating out at hotels that have room tariff of more than rs 7,500 should attract a uniform 18 per cent rate instead of any separate category for 5-star hotel, which currently falls under the 28 per cent bracket. with regard to traders, the gom came up with a two-pronged approach for taxation under the composition scheme. it suggested that traders who want to exclude sale proceeds of tax-free items from turnover can pay 1 per cent gst. however, for those who pay tax on total turnover, the tax rate has been proposed at 0.5 per cent. while a regular taxpayer has to pay taxes on a monthly basis, a composition supplier is required to file only one return and pay taxes on a quarterly basis. with a view to easing compliance burden of taxpayers, the council is also going to review the requirement of filing three returns every month under the gst set-up. businesses have to file returns in gstr-1, gstr-2 and gstr-3 forms for every month. these forms detail outward supplies of taxable goods and/or services, inward supplies for claiming input tax credit and monthly returns. the review follows businesses complaining about problems in matching invoices while filing july returns. businesses have also complained of trouble in invoice matching while filing gstr-2. “it would be reviewed whether matching of invoices should be done every month or that should be made only quarterly,” the official added. the assam finance minister-headed gom has already suggested allowing all businesses to file quarterly returns under the gst regime, akin to those businesses whose monthly turnover is up to rs 1.5 crore. the first three months of gst rollout have earned a cumulative revenue, including integrated gst collections, of around rs 2.78 lakh crore for the exchequer. the businesses have initially filed sales returns or gstr-3b and paid taxes. gstr-3b was introduced for making compliance easy and would be available only till december. the official further said that gstr-3b might be extended beyond december as the government felt that businesses had adapted themselves to the system. 3b is required to be filed by the 20th of next month. the final gst returns are to be filed by submitting forms gstr-1, 2 and 3. over 47 lakh businesses have filed gstr-1 return for july. these sales returns will have to be matched with the purchase invoice to be filed in gstr-2. over 21 lakh businesses have filed july gstr-2 and the due date for filing has been extended by a month to november 30. after matching of gstr-1 and 2, the businesses will have to file july gstr-3, the last date for which is december 11. pti ","gst council may prune items 28 per cent slab , simplify returns","guwahati , november 9 gst council friday may consider reducing items 28 per cent tax slab slash rates daily-use items , plastic products hand-made furniture looks provide relief consumers. four months goods services tax ( gst ) rolled , panel headed union finance minister arun jaitley look comprehensive overhaul rates , easing returns-filing providing relief small medium enterprises , official sources said. 23rd meeting council , held , also deliberate suggestions made assam finance minister himanta biswa sarma-headed gom cut tax rates composition scheme businesses 1 per cent lower rates non-ac restaurants. council , comprising state finance ministers , also set review gst returns filing cycle make taxpayer-friendly. ;

(follow the tribune on facebook; and twitter @thetribunechd) as many as 178 items of daily use were shifted from the top tax bracket of 28 per cent to 18 per cent, while a uniform 5 per cent tax was prescribed for all restaurants, both air-conditioned and non-ac, finance minister arun jaitley said after the gst council meeting here. ; currently, 12 per cent gst on food bill is levied in non-ac restaurants and 18 per cent in air-conditioned ones. all these got input tax credit, a facility to set off tax paid on inputs with final tax. jaitley said the restaurants, however, did not pass on the input tax credit (itc) to customers and so the itc facility is being withdrawn and a uniform 5 per cent tax is levied on all restaurants without the distinction of ac or non-ac. restaurants in starred-hotels that charge rs 7,500 or more per day room tariff will be levied 18 per cent gst but itc is allowed for them. those restaurants in hotels charging less than rs 7,500 room tariff will charge 5 per cent gst but will not get itc. the all-powerful gst council pruned the list of items in the top 28 per cent goods and services tax (gst) slab to just 50 from current 228. so, only luxury and sins goods are now only in highest tax bracket and items of daily use are shifted to 18 per cent. also, tax on wet grinders and armoured vehicles was cut from 28 per cent to 12 per cent, he said, adding the tax rate on six items was reduced from 18 per cent to 5 per cent, on 8 items from 12 per cent to 5 per cent and on six items from 5 per cent to nil. chewing gum, chocolates, coffee, custard powder, marble and granite, dental hygiene products, polishes and creams, sanitary ware, leather clothing, artificial fur, wigs, cookers, stoves, after-shave, deodorant, detergent and washing power, razors and blades, cutlery, storage water heater, batteries, goggles, wrist watches and mattress are among the products on which tax rate has been cut from 28 per cent to 18 per cent. the top tax rate is now restricted to luxury and demerit goods like pan masala, aerated water and beverages, cigars and cigarettes, tobacco products, cement, paints, perfumes, acs, dish washing machine, washing machine, refrigerators, vacuum cleaners, cars and two-wheelers, aircraft and yacht. items on which tax rate has been cut from 28 per cent to 18 per cent include wire and cables, furniture, mattress, trunk, suitcase, detergents, shampoos, hair cream, hair dyes, make up, fans, lamp, rubber tubes and microscope. tax rate on condensed milk, refined sugar, pasta curry paste, diabetic food, medicinal grade oxygen, printing ink, hand bags, hats, spectacles frame and bamboo/cane furniture has been cut from 18 per cent to 12 per cent. that on puffed rice chikki, flour of potatoes, chutney power, fly sulphur recovered in refining crude and fly ash to 6 per cent from 18 per cent. guar meal, hop cone, certain dried vegetables, unworked coconut shell and fish would attract nil gst tax as against 5 per cent now. tax on idli-dosa batter, finished leather, coir, fishing net, worn clothing and desiccated coconut has been cut to 5 per cent from 12 per cent. “consumers will be benefited by lower prices as most of the taxable items are in the 5 per cent, 12 per cent or 18 per cent slabs,” jaitley said. the cut in tax will cost rs 20,000 crore in revenues annually, bihar deputy chief minister sushil kumar modi said. launched on july 1, the gst weaved 29 states into a single market with one tax rate but while traders and small business complained of increased compliance burden, voices of dissent rose on high tax rate on some common use goods. with economy growing by its slowest pace since narendra modi government came to power, the “panic-stricken govt has no option but to concede demands for change” in the tax, former finance minister p chidambaram, said on twitter today. in ease compliance burden, the council relaxed the return filing criteria and also lowered the penalties for late filing. “as part of efforts to rationalise gst structure, the council has been reviewing rates from time to time. in the last 3 meetings, we have been systematically looking at 28 per cent tax bracket and rationalising certain items out of that bracket into lesser categories, mostly 18 per cent or even less,” jaitley said. gst tax slabs of 5, 12, 18 and 28 per cent were decided going by the principle of fitting each item into a category most close to cumulative pre-gst taxes. “optically, some items should not have been in 28 per cent despite being in old regime. secondly, some items manufactured by small entities had excise exemption,” he said, adding in the last meetings 30-40 items have been taken out of 28 per cent bracket. bipin sapra, tax partner, ey india, said, “while the reduction of rates would substantially reduce the prices of a number of commodities; however the government may need to balance the revenue considerations too.” krishan arora, partner, grant thornton india llp said the decision of gst council on pruning of the 28 slab list would be a welcome move for many industries in mass consumption space. in certain cases, it is also likely to bring down the total tax impact even lower than earlier regime which would be a big relief to the industry as well as consumers. rationalisation exercise of tax slabs needs to be carried out comprehensively keeping in mind the significance of the industry and the overall tax incidence under earlier regime, arora said. vishal raheja of taxmann described the move as “great step” and said, “in future, we may expect that the government will further slash tax rates by moving from 4-tier tax slabs to lesser slabs or even single gst rate”. abhishek a rastogi of khaitan & co said while it was expected that there will be rate cuts, it was never expected that the list will be trimmed down so significantly. “with the rate reduction on a plethora of products, the next step of the government should be to ensure that the benefit of the rate reduction goes to the consumers,” he said. “it appears that after this mass rate reduction various anti-profiteering problems may kickoff for businesses which would not pass on the benefit to the consumers.” pti ",gst 178 items mass consumption slashed 18 %,"guwahati , november 10 biggest gst rejig yet , tax rates 200 items , ranging chewing gum chocolates , beauty products , wigs wrist watches , friday cut provide relief consumers businesses amid economic slowdown.

2017-11-16,cabinet clears setting up of gst anti-profiteering authority,"new delhi, november 16 the union cabinet on thursday approved setting up of a national anti-profiteering authority under the gst, as it seeks to ensure that consumers get the benefit of reduced prices under the new indirect tax regime. (follow the tribune on facebook; and twitter @thetribunechd) union minister ravi shankar prasad said currently there are only 50 items which attract the highest tax of 28 per cent under the goods and services tax (gst) regime and rates on many items have been cut to 5 per cent as well. ; ""the national anti-profiteering authority is an assurance to consumers of india. if any consumer feels that the benefit of tax rate cut is not being passed on, he can complaint to the authority,"" prasad told reporters after the cabinet meeting. this reflects government's full commitment to take all possible steps to ensure benefits of implementation of gst to the common man, the minister said. the approval by the cabinet paves the way for immediate establishment of the apex body, which is mandated to ensure that the benefits of gst rate reduction is passed on to consumers. the gst council, chaired by union finance minister and comprising state counterparts, had last week decided to slash tax rates of over 200 items in the gst regime as well as lowered tax rates on ac and non-ac restaurants to 5 per cent. the council had earlier approved setting up of a five-member national anti—profiteering authority to enable consumers to file complaint in case price reduction is not passed on. a five-member committee, headed by cabinet secretary p k sinha, comprising revenue secretary hasmukh adhia, cbec chairman vanaja sarna and chief secretaries from two states, has been entrusted to finalise the chairman and members of the authority. the authority will have a sunset date of two years from the date on which the chairman assumes charge. the chairman and the four members of the authority have to be less than 62 years. as per the structure of the anti-profiteering mechanism in the gst regime, complaints of local nature will be first sent to the state-level 'screening committee', while those of national level will be marked for the 'standing committee'. if the complaints have merit, the respective committees would refer the cases for further investigation to the directorate general of safeguards (dgs). the dg safeguards would generally take about three months to complete the investigation and send the report to the anti-profiteering authority. if the authority finds that a company has not passed on gst benefits, it will either direct the entity to pass on the benefits to consumers or if the beneficiary cannot be identified will ask the company to transfer the amount to the 'consumer welfare fund' within a specified timeline. the authority will have the power to cancel registration of any entity or business if it fails to pass on to consumers the benefit of lower taxes under the gst regime, but it would probably be the last step against any violator. according to the anti—profiteering rules, the authority will suggest return of the undue profit earned from not passing on the reduction in incidence of tax to consumers along with an 18 per cent interest, as also impose penalty. — pti ",cabinet clears setting gst anti-profiteering authority,"new delhi , november 16 union cabinet thursday approved setting national anti-profiteering authority gst , seeks ensure consumers get benefit reduced prices new indirect tax regime.

2017-11-17,moody’s action spruces up india’s investment credentials," new delhi, november 17 the sovereign rating upgrade by global agency moody’s has put india alongside italy, spain, bulgaria and the philippines in terms of investment climate. in effect, india has become the largest economy among baa2-rated sovereigns, according to moody’s. the agency on friday upgraded india’s sovereign credit rating by a notch to ‘baa2’ with stable outlook after a gap of 13 years, saying reforms would foster sustainable growth. sovereign rating is issued to national governments and is a barometer of the country’s investment climate. it gives investors insight into the level of risks, including political, associated with investing in a particular country. ; according to moody’s, baa rating is medium-grade and subject to moderate credit risk while the modifier 2 indicates a mid-range ranking. the government and some commentators in india have been pitching hard for a rating upgrade citing the country’s strong economic fundamentals, political stability and a slew of reforms. some of the key reforms that the narendra modi government has initiated include the goods and services tax (gst), demonetisation, aadhaar, bank recapitalisation, the insolvency and bankruptcy code and targeted delivery of benefits through the direct benefit transfer (dbt) system, among others. the other two leading global rating organisations such as fitch and s&p have bbb- rating with a stable outlook. bbb- is just a notch above the junk grade and the lowest in investment ratings. the upgrade signals increasing confidence in the indian economy vis-a-vis china in the international market. in september, s&p global ratings cut china’s long-term sovereign credit rating by one level to ‘a+’ from ‘aa-’. even moody’s in may this year downgraded china to a1 from aa3 and changed outlook to stable from negative. after moody’s action, india is now three notches away from china. with baa2 and a stable outlook, india is behind only china in the brics bloc, moody’s said, adding that india, china and south africa are investment grade sovereigns in the grouping. russia has a ba1 rating, south africa (baa3) and brazil (ba2). foreign investors are expected to see the current action by moody’s as another evidence of a growing indian economy. a rating upgrade usually gives a leg-up to the economy, prompting companies to expand capacity in the country, which also generates more jobs. this is also viewed as a positive sign by investors in stocks, bonds and currency markets, sparking more capital inflows. the factors that rating agencies normally consider while deciding on sovereign ratings include fdi inflows, debt-to-gdp ratio and per capita income of nations, among others. according to moody’s, the average fiscal deficit of the other baa2-rated countries was 4.2 per cent in 2016 and 3.1 per cent in 2017 (forecast). the “median debt: gdp ratio for baa2 countries as against india’s debt:gdp ratio stood at 42.7294:68.9645,” moody’s said. moreover, on a ppp basis, india’s gdp per capita has outstripped the baa-rated median for 19 countries. between 2006 and 2016, this grew by 108 per cent against 74 per cent for all baa-rated medians, it added. pti ",moody ’ action spruces india ’ investment credentials,"new delhi , november 17 sovereign rating upgrade global agency moody ’ put india alongside italy , spain , bulgaria philippines terms investment climate. effect , india become largest economy among baa2-rated sovereigns , according moody ’ s. agency friday upgraded india ’ sovereign credit rating notch ‘baa2 ’ stable outlook gap 13 years , saying reforms would foster sustainable growth. sovereign rating issued national governments barometer country ’ investment climate. gives investors insight level risks , including political , associated investing particular country. ;

2017-11-19,'hardik factor': is bjp contemplating a patidar cm face for gujarat,"vibha sharma  new delhi, november 19 in high-stakes gujarat, while the bjp contends the situation “very much under control” apparently it is “not quite how its top leadership would have preferred it to be”. a reason why there are now speculations that party chief amit shah may be having a change of heart over his original plan to go with incumbent chief minister vijay rupani as the bjp’s face in the coming elections. ; in fact, bjp leaders directly involved with assimilating ground inputs say “as on date and in given circumstances, the bjp appears to be winning between 105 and 122 seats” in the 182-member assembly. “perhaps around 115 seats but not 150 as leaders have been projecting. but there are still 20 days to go (for first phase), anything can happen,” they say. the main reason for this is the hype and the hullabaloo around this young patidar leader called hardik patel. interestingly, while the bjp leadership is trying to get him by their side, or so claim the local sources, hardik patel’s one-point agenda is reservation for his community, which makes it kind of tough for any negotiations to fructify. prime minister narendra modi, they say, is against any kind of reservation. so that leaves for the bjp the only other plausible solution and which is projecting a clear-cut patidar leader as its cm face. those in contention for the job could be deputy cm nitin patel, union minister purushottam rupala and state president jitu vaghani. what may go favour of nitin patel are the number of mlas supporting him. while the first list of 70 candidates released on friday had as many as 18 patidar candidates, the list of 36 released yesterday also had many from the community (around 13, some local leaders claim). while the main rival congress is struggling to find consensus on issues, taking the lead the bjp has so far announced 106 candidates for the elections to be held in two phases — december 9 and 14. the second list for 36 constituencies includes 14 reserved seats, 12 st and two sc candidates. it is expected that the remaining names may be announced around tuesday. though they constitute only around 13 per cent of the vote-share, patidars have the power to influence a much larger base (some claim 70 to 80 per cent) due to their hold on the business in the state. apart from the hardik patel factor, there seem to be other reasons troubling the bjp leadership. disgruntlement among rural areas and farmers and the gst seems to be some of them. “what goes in our (bjp) favour is the tina (there is no other alternative) factor. independent surveys indicate disenchantment because of several reasons. as on date, the bjp is winning gujarat but not with the numbers befitting the reputation of prime minister and shah,” they say. shah has said the elections are being contested under the leadership of incumbents vijay rupani and nitin patel. normally, the bjp goes with the incumbent in the state it is in power so that makes the claim of vijay rupani higher. however, opting for a patidar cm candidate would not just stump hardik patel and also main rival congress, which does not have a strong leader from the community to take charge of the situation. local leaders expect the prime minister to make a formal announcement on the issue of cm face next he addresses a public rally in gujarat. notably, chief minister before and after narendra modi was in the chair were both patidars — keshubhai patel and anandiben patel. after anandiben’s resignation it was expected that nitin patel, who was then the finance minister, would take charge but the bjp chose rupani, which is again believed to have caused a lot of heartburn among the community.",' hardik factor ' : bjp contemplating patidar cm face gujarat,"vibha sharma new delhi , november 19 high-stakes gujarat , bjp contends situation “very much control ” apparently “not quite top leadership would preferred ” . reason speculations party chief amit shah may change heart original plan go incumbent chief minister vijay rupani bjp ’ face coming elections. ;

2017-12-05,to the manner born? rahul gandhi gets ready to be cong prez,"new delhi, december 5 in january 2013, rahul gandhi was named congress vice-president when his mother told him the night before that ""power is like poison"". five years after that emotional acceptance speech in jaipur, rahul gandhi is ready to pick up that poison chalice. with no other claimants to the post, he will step into his mother sonia gandhi's shoes as congress president next week. ‘shehzada’, ‘princeling’ and ‘pappu’, the gandhi scion, who saw his grandmother and father being assassinated, has been called many a derogatory name through the years as he appeared to shy away from the responsibility of leading the congress. the young bespectacled boy who clung to his father rajiv gandhi's waist as his grandmother indira gandhi's body was consigned to flames is now 47. ; there has been no getting away from the spotlight since for the man poised to take over as president of the party, the sixth from the gandhi-nehru 'dynasty' to do so, continuing a chain beginning with motilal nehru. the easy elevation is unsurprising, given the tacit understanding within the party that the mantle must pass from gandhi to gandhi. politics may or may not have been his calling but it was certainly in his blood. so, as he moved from a home education to delhi university's st stephen's college and then to harvard and rollins college in florida and trinity college, cambridge, the final goal was always clear. he also joined the monitor group, a consulting group in london, where he worked for three years. but it had to be back home, to a political role carved out for him, after that. often dismissed for practising the politics of ""fits and starts"", rahul gandhi became an mp in 2004 when he won the amethi lok sabha seat. he has taken a surprisingly long time to learn the ropes, coming across as earnest and well meaning but also uncertain and disinterested. he took up emotive issues like the agrarian crisis in vidarbha, did the unusual by staying the night at a dalit home in uttar pradesh with then british foreign secretary david milliband, but squandered much of the goodwill by seeming to lose interest and disappearing from view. in 2015, for instance, he took a 56-day sabbatical. and there are also two annual sojourns timed around his june birthday and new year's eve. he may no longer have that luxury. his first litmus test is only days away with elections in gujarat on december 9 and 14. the results for both the polls in himachal pradesh and gujarat will be out on december 18. top congress leaders say rahul gandhi's leadership of the party would be established if he delivers a victory in gujarat or at least substantially improves the congress tally. gandhi's past electoral record has not been too good. since he became congress vice-president in 2013, the party has lost power in state after state and is left with only punjab, puducherry, meghalaya, karnataka and himachal pradesh. but rahul gandhi looks more confident than he has for a while, having worked on his image and outreach. armed with a refurbished social media team mostly managed by his hand-picked people, he is trying to shed his reticence and appear more accessible. he’s now more relaxed and confident, targets modi regularly with snappy one liners (gabbar singh tax, for instance), takes selfies with people and has improved his twitter following to 4.71 million. in a dose perhaps of some realpolitik, rahul gandhi is also openly declaring his hindu credentials. ""i am a lord shiva worshipper,"" he said recently to counter the bjp's efforts to win the hindu vote. he has been visiting temples routinely -- and does not necessarily visit mosques at the same time. in doing so, he seems to be correcting the congress' pro-minority image. rahul gandhi has also been speaking out on his life outside the spotlight. ""i believe in destiny,"" he said when asked why he is not getting married. he recently also revealed that he is a black belt in the japanese martial art form aikido. it may have made a difference. of late, the bjp seems to be taking rahul gandhi more seriously, often fielding a host of ministers to counter the congress charge against demonetisation and gst. congress leaders say he has come of age and cite his address at the university of california, berkley, where he boldly took questions, even on dynastic politics. there was the rahul gandhi who walked into the press club of india and tore off an ordinance by the then congress-led upa government headed by manmohan singh to overturn an apex court order barring convicted mps from contesting elections. and then there is this one readying to be president of the grand old party. maybe not so impetuous or naive, but reasoned and rational. the normally taciturn manmohan singh yesterday called rahul gandhi the ""darling of the congress"" after he filed his nomination. it is now up to rahul gandhi to prove he is indeed one. — pti ",manner born ? rahul gandhi gets ready cong prez,"new delhi , december 5 january 2013 , rahul gandhi named congress vice-president mother told night "" power like poison "" . five years emotional acceptance speech jaipur , rahul gandhi ready pick poison chalice. claimants post , step mother sonia gandhi ' shoes congress president next week. ‘shehzada ’ , ‘princeling ’ ‘pappu ’ , gandhi scion , saw grandmother father assassinated , called many derogatory name years appeared shy away responsibility leading congress. young bespectacled boy clung father rajiv gandhi ' waist grandmother indira gandhi ' body consigned flames 47. ; getting away spotlight since man poised take president party , sixth gandhi-nehru ' dynasty ' , continuing chain beginning motilal nehru. easy elevation unsurprising , given tacit understanding within party mantle must pass gandhi gandhi. politics may may calling certainly blood. , moved home education delhi university ' st stephen ' college harvard rollins college florida trinity college , cambridge , final goal always clear. also joined monitor group , consulting group london , worked three years. back home , political role carved , that. often dismissed practising politics "" fits starts "" , rahul gandhi became mp 2004 amethi lok sabha seat. taken surprisingly long time learn ropes , coming across earnest well meaning also uncertain disinterested. took emotive issues like agrarian crisis vidarbha , unusual staying night dalit home uttar pradesh british foreign secretary david milliband , squandered much goodwill seeming lose interest disappearing view. 2015 , instance , took 56-day sabbatical. also two annual sojourns timed around june birthday new year ' eve. may longer luxury. first litmus test days away elections gujarat december 9 14. results polls himachal pradesh gujarat december 18. top congress leaders say rahul gandhi ' leadership party would established delivers victory gujarat least substantially improves congress tally. gandhi ' past electoral record good. since became congress vice-president 2013 , party lost power state state left punjab , puducherry , meghalaya , karnataka himachal pradesh. rahul gandhi looks confident , worked image outreach. armed refurbished social media team mostly managed hand-picked people , trying shed reticence appear accessible. ’ relaxed confident , targets modi regularly snappy one liners ( gabbar singh tax , instance ) , takes selfies people improved twitter following 4.71 million. dose perhaps realpolitik , rahul gandhi also openly declaring hindu credentials.

2017-12-06,guj polls: ‘cong will provide free sanitary pads to girl students’,"vadodara, december 6 the congress will provide sanitary napkins to girl students in gujarat free of cost by abolishing gst if voted to power, all india mahila congress president sushmita dev announced here on wednesday. dev also attacked the narendra modi government for imposing “12 per cent” gst on sanitary napkins, which she said “runs contrary” to the government’s “beti bachao beti padhao” campaign for girls. “imposition of 12 per cent gst on sanitary napkins is a big shocker for poor girls and women. the modi government did not slash the tax (on sanitary napkins) despite demands raised by various ngos and women’s group though it reduced the tax on other items,” dev said while addressing reporters. the campaigning for the first phase of polls, slated for december 9, will end tomorrow. if voted to power, congress will provide sanitary napkins to girl students of schools and colleges in the state free of cost, she said. ; dev said not reducing the gst on sanitary napkins is “contradictory” to the “beti bachao beti padhao” campaign of the central government. “at one end, the government is promoting healthier menstrual hygiene practices among girls and women while on the other hand they are increasing the cost of sanitary napkins,” said dev, who represents silchar seat in assam. she said the imposition of 12 per cent gst on sanitary pads is a “regressive move in the menstrual health discourse”, which will take a toll on health of poor girls and women who lack the access to sanitary napkins. dev sought to link the “rising girls’ school dropout ratio in gujarat” with costlier sanitary pads. “i am afraid that higher price (of sanitary pads) on account of gst might push girls back to adopting unhygienic menstrual practices,” the congress leader said. dev also attacked gujarat chief minister vijay rupani for “not filling up” posts of women in the state police department. former chief minister anandiben patel had in 2014 announced 33 per cent quota for women in gujarat police force. dev also claimed that the gujarat police have been refusing to register complaints of rape sought to be lodged by affected women. “congress will set up a committee in each district of gujarat to extend help to the victims of rape,” she said. speaking after dev, congress national spokesperson priyanka chaturvedi termed as an “eyewash” the “beti bachao beti padhao” campaign. “when it comes to female sex ratio in gujarat, the state is ranked at 24th position in the country. rate of literacy in women is also low in gujarat,” she said. chaturvedi accused the prime minister of “remaining silent” on the naliya gang-rape issue while addressing public rallies in the poll-bound state. “modi didn’t say a word about the gang-rape because some bjp office-bearers are allegedly involved in the crime,” she said, adding that no progress is made in the case despite the chief minister ordering a judicial inquiry. — pti ",guj polls : ‘cong provide free sanitary pads girl students ’,"vadodara , december 6 congress provide sanitary napkins girl students gujarat free cost abolishing gst voted power , india mahila congress president sushmita dev announced wednesday. dev also attacked narendra modi government imposing “12 per cent ” gst sanitary napkins , said “runs contrary ” government ’ “beti bachao beti padhao ” campaign girls. “imposition 12 per cent gst sanitary napkins big shocker poor girls women. modi government slash tax ( sanitary napkins ) despite demands raised various ngos women ’ group though reduced tax items , ” dev said addressing reporters. campaigning first phase polls , slated december 9 , end tomorrow. voted power , congress provide sanitary napkins girl students schools colleges state free cost , said. ;

2017-12-06,campaigning for first phase of gujarat polls ends tomorrow,"ahmedabad, december 6 the high-octane campaign for the first phase of the crucial gujarat assembly polls, viewed as a prestige battle for prime minister narendra modi and a litmus test for the leadership of soon-to-be congress chief rahul gandhi, will come to an end tomorrow. a total of 89 seats—out of 182—spanning the saurashtra and south gujarat regions, are up for grabs in the first phase with 977 candidates in the fray, including chief minister vijay rupani. voting will be held on december 9. while the bjp is fighting anti-incumbency and struggling to alter a seemingly negative perception about demonetisation and the goods and services tax (gst) rollout, the congress, galvanised by an assertive rahul gandhi, has mainly targeted the “hollow gujarat development model” to slam modi. modi and gandhi had aggressively led their parties’ campaigns in saurashtra and south gujarat which often turned personal. ; saurashtra and kutch are crucial for the ruling bjp as these two regions have the highest concentration of seats in the first phase. political pundits believe that the party winning the maximum number of seats from saurashtra and kutch will be better placed to form the next government in the state. saurashtra, located on the arabian sea coast, covers 11 districts of the state. kutch is the largest district comprising 10 talukas, 939 villages and six municipalities. of the 58 seats in saurashtra and kutch, the bjp had won 35 in the 2012 assembly polls and the congress 20. of the remaining three seats, two were won by the now-defunct gujarat parivartan party (gpp) of keshubhai patel and one by the nationalist congress party (ncp). in 2007, the tally of the bjp and the congress in saurashtra and kutch stood at 43 and 14 respectively, while the ncp had bagged one seat. of the 35 seats spread across the seven districts of south gujarat, the bjp had won 28 and the congress six in the 2012 polls. the remaining seat was won by “others”. the 2009 tally for the bjp and the congress stood at 19 and 14 seats respectively in south gujarat, while two constituencies had gone to “others”. prominent candidates in the fray for the saturday battle include rupani, who is contesting from rajkot (west) against the congress’ indranil rajyaguru, shaktisinh gohil (mandvi) and paresh dhanani (amreli) — both from the congress. rajput strongman gohil has locked horns with the bjp’s new face, virendrasinh jadeja, also a rajput, in the muslim-dominated seat. in patidar-dominated amreli, dhanani (the sitting congress mla) is pitted against bjp heavyweight bavkubhai undhad, the legislator from the nearby lathi seat. the contest for the 12 seats in surat, the diamond and textile hub of the country, is being viewed as a referendum on the note ban and gst, as the bjp is facing a stiff opposition from the trading community. during canvassing, gandhi had interacted with the traders in surat, who vented their ire against demonetisation and the “complicated gst structure”. subsequently, the congress vice-president had attacked the modi government over the “four-tier” gst structure and sought rationalisation of the indirect tax rates. for the bjp, union ministers arun jaitley and smriti irani had held the fort to defend the gst and note ban, while trying to allay the concerns of the traders and textile merchants during their interactions with them. on the campaign trail, modi had addressed about 14 rallies, while gandhi had spent more than seven days in saurashtra and south gujarat, addressing a number of meetings. bjp president amit shah, the chief poll strategist of the saffron party, had also addressed a number of rallies, mainly targeting the congress and gandhi. the bjp had also drafted in union minister rajnath singh, nirmala sitharaman, besides uttar pradesh chief minister yogi adityanath, rajasthan chief minister vasundhara raje and madhya pradesh chief minister shivraj singh chouhan. the congress had fielded former prime minister manmohan singh and prominent leaders such as p chidambaram, jyotiraditya scindia, sachin pilot, to name a few, for canvassing. the campaign mainly shaped up as a duel between modi and gandhi, with the latter emerging as the congress’ pivot to take on the might of the prime minister on the latter’s home turf. a big takeaway for the congress was ensuring the support of the hardik patel-led patidar anamat andolan samiti (paas), an umbrella organisation of the numerically strong patidar community, which traditionally formed the bedrock of the bjp’s support in gujarat. in its bid to form a caste bloc against the bjp, the congress won over alpesh thakor, patel and jignesh mewani, who have emerged as the young turks representing the obcs, patidars and dalits respectively. the congress, which is in political wilderness in gujarat for 22 years, is desperate to break the jinx. it has raised issues

earlier, a row had erupted over the youth congress’ online magazine tweeting a meme of modi, mocking his english speaking skills and raising his “chaiwalla” past. similarly, gandhi’s visit to the

2017-12-07,can cong breach urban bjp stronghold of 'diamond city' surat?,"ahmedabad, december 7 surat, gujarat's diamond city and the epicenter of the patidar quota movement, is set for a tough assembly poll battle as the congress has added the face of the patidar agitation hardik patel to its arsenal this time. amid issues like implementation of the goods and services tax (gst) and demonetisation, apart from the 'patidar' factor, it is to be seen for whom the large trading community of this diamond and textile hub will vote, when the city goes to polls in the first phase on saturday. though ahmedabad is the largest city of gujarat, surat is a favoured destination of political heavyweights in this poll season. congress vice-president rahul gandhi visited the city twice last month to understand the plight of those who were “hit by gst and note ban”. during his visit, gandhi also addressed a huge rally in the city’s patidar strongholds - varachha and katargam. ; on december 3, quota agitation leader hardik patel led a mega road show in varachha. gujarat chief minister vijay rupani led the bjp’s road show in majura area the same day. prime minister narendra modi last month addressed a rally at kadodara, located on the city's outskirts. the congress is hoping to snatch some seats from the bjp this time by capitalising on the 'anger' factor of patidars and the traders. on the other side, the bjp is confident of retaining its bastion, as its leaders claim the “ground reality” is different from what the congress is projecting. out of the total 12 constituencies in surat city, nearly half of the seats - varachha road, kamrej, katargam, karanj, olpad and udhna - have a concentrated population of patidars, who mostly migrated here from saurashtra. the remaining six seats are - surat-east, surat-north, surat-west, choryasi, limbayat and majura. to some extent, surat-north and majura seats also have a significant population of patidars, who are into various businesses, including diamond cutting, polishing, trading and in different trades associated with textiles. the city has been a bastion of the bjp since long. but, the political scenario in this bustling business hub seems to have changed after hardik patel started the agitation to get reservation for his community two years back. at that time, surat witnessed large scale violence and arson, mostly in varachha and adjoining areas. out of the two sedition cases lodged against hardik, one was registered in surat. since then, the hardik-led agitating body, patidar anamat andolan samiti (paas), is up in arms against the ruling bjp and has vowed to defeat it. notably, bjp president amit shah had to cut short his speech at a function in varachha area in september when some paas agitators created chaos by shouting slogans and throwing chairs. now, in an apparent bid to thwart the anti-incumbency factor following the patidar 'anger', the bjp has dropped six of its sitting mlas - from kamrej, surat-east, surat-north, karanj, udhna and katargam seats. these leaders include sitting mla of katargam, nanu vanani, who is a minister in the rupani government. out of the nearly 1.98 lakh voters of varachha road seat, the patidars are in the driving seat with their number being over 1.5 lakh. in kamrej, where the total electorate is about 4.28 lakh, the patidars alone account for over two lakh. in katargam, having around 2.77 voters, the patidars are in a dominating position with over 1.18 lakh electorate. besides the 'angry' patidars and traders, there are various other factors which could breach the hull of bjp's ship in this coastal city. since a large population, mostly patels, of this city belongs to saurashtra region, the agrarian crisis back home could also add fuel into their “anger” here, surat city congress president hasmukh desai said. “many decades back, patels and other communities from saurashtra region started settling here. since they still own agricultural land back home, they are holding the bjp government responsible for their dwindling farm income. it is possible that their anger could reflect in the voting here,"" desai said. apart from patidars, the congress is also banking on small traders and entrepreneurs whose businesses were claimed to have been hit by demonetisation and the implementation of gst by the bjp-led government at the centre. in july, the textile traders of surat city called a massive strike against the gst. the congress was quick to take up the issue and party vice president rahul gandhi held two back-to-back visits last month. “on one side we are getting full support from the patidars, while on the other the trading community and the shopkeepers, who are spread across the city, are seeing a ray of hope in congress after gandhi's visit. all the factors are in our favour,"" desai claimed. however, the bjp discarded the argument, claiming that the ground reality is totally different. ""though traders were unhappy initially, they now understand the benefits of gst. this so-called anger will never convert into votes. if the people were still against us, then why so many had turned up for the chief minister's rally?"" bjp's sitting mla from majura, harsh sanghvi, asked. meanwhile, the paas members have already hit the streets in the patidar-dominated areas to convince people not to vote for the bjp. according to paas convener for surat, dharmik malavia, they have set a target of defeating the bjp on at least five seats - varachha road, karanj, kamrej, olpad and surat-north. ""when we tell people do not vote for the bjp, it implies that vote for congress if you want to uproot the party which committed atrocities on us,"" malavia said. “the people are in our support and the bjp candidates are finding it difficult to even enter into the patidar societies for canvassing,"" he claimed. the 182-member gujarat assembly will go to the polls in two phases -- on december 9 and 14 -- and the counting of votes will be taken up on december 18. pti",cong breach urban bjp stronghold ' diamond city ' surat ?,"ahmedabad , december 7 surat , gujarat ' diamond city epicenter patidar quota movement , set tough assembly poll battle congress added face patidar agitation hardik patel arsenal time. amid issues like implementation goods services tax ( gst ) demonetisation , apart ' patidar ' factor , seen large trading community diamond textile hub vote , city goes polls first phase saturday. though ahmedabad largest city gujarat , surat favoured destination political heavyweights poll season. congress vice-president rahul gandhi visited city twice last month understand plight “hit gst note ban ” . visit , gandhi also addressed huge rally city ’ patidar strongholds - varachha katargam. ; december 3 , quota agitation leader hardik patel led mega road show varachha. gujarat chief minister vijay rupani led bjp ’ road show majura area day. prime minister narendra modi last month addressed rally kadodara , located city ' outskirts. congress hoping snatch seats bjp time capitalising ' anger ' factor patidars traders. side , bjp confident retaining bastion , leaders claim “ground reality ” different congress projecting. total 12 constituencies surat city , nearly half seats - varachha road , kamrej , katargam , karanj , olpad udhna - concentrated population patidars , mostly migrated saurashtra. remaining six seats - surat-east , surat-north , surat-west , choryasi , limbayat majura. extent , surat-north majura seats also significant population patidars , various businesses , including diamond cutting , polishing , trading different trades associated textiles. city bastion bjp since long. , political scenario bustling business hub seems changed hardik patel started agitation get reservation community two years back. time , surat witnessed large scale violence arson , mostly varachha adjoining areas. two sedition cases lodged hardik , one registered surat. since , hardik-led agitating body , patidar anamat andolan samiti ( paas ) , arms ruling bjp vowed defeat it. notably , bjp president amit shah cut short speech function varachha area september paas agitators created chaos shouting slogans throwing chairs. , apparent bid thwart anti-incumbency factor following patidar ' anger ' , bjp dropped six sitting mlas - kamrej , surat-east , surat-north , karanj , udhna katargam seats. leaders include sitting mla katargam , nanu vanani , minister rupani government. nearly 1.98 lakh voters varachha road seat , patidars driving seat number 1.5 lakh. kamrej , total electorate 4.28 lakh , patidars alone account two lakh. katargam , around 2.77 voters , patidars dominating position 1.18 lakh electorate. besides ' angry ' patidars traders , various factors could breach hull bjp ' ship coastal city. since large population , mostly patels , city belongs saurashtra region , agrarian crisis back home could also add fuel “anger ” , surat city congress president hasmukh desai said. “many decades back , patels communities saurashtra region started settling here. since still agricultural land back home , holding bjp government responsible dwindling farm income. possible anger could reflect voting , "" desai said. apart patidars , congress also banking small traders entrepreneurs whose businesses claimed hit demonetisation implementation gst bjp-led government centre. july , textile traders surat city called massive strike gst. congress quick take issue party vice president rahul gandhi held two back-to-back visits last month. “on one side getting full support patidars , trading community shopkeepers , spread across city , seeing ray hope congress gandhi ' visit. factors favour , "" desai claimed. however , bjp discarded argument , claiming ground reality totally different.

2017-12-08,cong jittery on guj poll eve,"aditi tandon  new delhi, december 7 the congress found itself on the defensive today after its senior leader mani shankar aiyar called pm narendra modi “neech aadmi”, giving the bjp ample ammunition against the grand old party two days ahead of the first phase of gujarat elections on december 9. snubbed by congress vice-president rahul gandhi, aiyar, who has been suspended from the party’s primary membership, quickly apologised for “misrepresentation” of his words that could harm congress’ interests in gujarat, but by then, party insiders acknowledged, the damage had been done. (follow the tribune on facebook; and twitter @thetribunechd) ; “what i said was a hindi translation of the english word “low”. i meant to say the language the pm used was very low. i never meant to say low born, like the pm has now misrepresented. i am told the word “neech” has several connotations in hindi. modi chose to distort it to mean low-born, but that is not what i meant nor is that my culture. i apologise for the misrepresentation the word used by me lent itself to, specially because it is going to harm congress interests in gujarat,” said aiyar, whose “chaiwala” remarks for modi had turned the 2014 lok sabha election tide in favour of the bjp. aiyar still maintains he never used the word “chaiwala” for modi. that said, congress leaders felt the jitters all day today and privately said aiyar’s remarks would damage party’s prospects in gujarat. that explained the instant rebuke aiyar attracted from congress president-elect rahul gandhi. congress officially denounced aiyar, who is famous in party circles for his self-goals. aiyar’s remarks, which came in reaction to the pm’s attack on first pm jawaharlal nehru, attracted widespread condemnation from within the congress. former law minister ashwani kumar said, “the ‘neech aadmi’ remark is totally unacceptable considering congress’ commitment to civilised discourse. in any case, two wrongs don’t make a right. civilised critique is more effective than personal attacks. personal barbs always leave a scar and every harsh word increases the bitterness that weakens the nation’s unity apart from being politically counter-productive.” meanwhile, former prime minister manmohan singh today claimed that it was because of the “vehement opposition” from pm modi, then the gujarat chief minister, and other bjp leaders that the congress-led upa government could not introduce the goods and services tax (gst). addressing the media in rajkot, the nerve centre of the saurashtra region, singh said the gst was originally proposed by the congress, but it could not be taken up due to “vehement opposition” by modi and the bjp party in general. singh claimed if the congress was allowed to bring the bill, the gst would have been in a “much simpler form”. stoking controversy ye aadmi bahut neech kisam ka aadmi hai, is mein koi sabhyata nahi hai, aur aise mauke par is kisam ki gandi rajniti karne ki kya avashyakta hai?

polls in gujarat, where prime minister narendra modi and congress’ heir-apparent rahul gandhi are locked in a bitter, high-stakes political duel after a 22-year reign of the bjp. ; (follow the tribune on facebook; and twitter @thetribunechd) sixty-eight per cent polling was recorded in the first phase of gujarat polls, senior deputy election commissioner unmesh sinha said. addressing a press conference, deputy election commissioner umesh sinha said polling was going on till late at many places, and those who were in the queue by 5 pm will be given an opportunity to vote. “in many places as reported till late the poll was going on. those who were in queue at 5 pm will be given an opportunity to vote,” he said, adding that the final polling figures will come late in the evening. the first phase of poll for 89 seats in 19 districts recorded 68 per cent polling, and it may touch the figure of 71 per cent, similar to the last assembly elections when the percentage was recorded at 70.7 per cent. district wise, polling in kachch district was recorded at 63 per cent, 75 in surendranagar, 75 in morbi, 70 in rajkot, 65 in jamnagar, 71 in bharuch, 73 in narmada, 73 in khed, 60 in

surat, in many of the patidar dominated areas, posters emerged with photographs of the dead patidar youth, killed during and after the patidar agitation on the gmdc grounds on august 25, 2015, reading “don’t forget the sacrifice of these martyrs and uproot the bjp”. there were reports of technical glitches in electronic voting machines (evms) in surat and some other centres, but the polling process resumed after the machines were replaced, election commission officials said. malfunctioning of evm machines was reported in sattapar village in anjar constituency and the polling process had to be halted. chief election officer bb swain said an inquiry was ordered after senior congress leader arjun modhwadia complained of possible evm tampering at three polling booths in a muslim-dominated area in porbandar. modhwadia claimed that some machines were found to be connecting to external devices via bluetooth. swain said: “we received the complaint with screenshots about the linkage of evm with wifi or bluetooth devices. so we rushed the collector, porbandar, and our observers from the election commission of india (eci) to the place. their scrutiny says that there was no merit in the complaint by arjun modhwadia.” as many as 977 candidates were in the fray in the 89 seats of saurashtra and south gujarat, of which 63 were won by the bjp and 26 by the congress in the 2012 assembly polls. a total turnout of 71.32 per cent was recorded in the last election to the 182-member assembly. as the polling process began at 8 am, people stepped out of their houses braving the cold weather and queued up to cast vote at polling stations. with the marriage season on, brides and grooms, clad in wedding finery, came to polling booths along with their relatives to exercise their franchise. many such voters were seen in bharuch, bhavnagar, gondal and surat. a 115-year-old woman from upleta town of rajkot, aajiben chandravadia, also voted. several important leaders and candidates, including gujarat chief minister vijay rupani, his opponent on rajkot-west seat indranil rajyaguru, senior congress leader ahmed patel, gujarat bjp chief jitu vaghani were among the early voters. cricketer cheteshwar pujara also cast his vote in rajkot. prominent candidates in saturday’s battle include chief minister vijay rupani, who is contesting from rajkot (west), congress’ shaktisinh gohil (mandvi) and paresh dhanani (amreli). the election is crucial for the congress and the bjp before the 2019 lok sabha polls and is seen as a prestige battle for modi, who was the chief minister of gujarat from 2001 to 2014, and a litmus test for the leadership of soon-to-be congress chief rahul gandhi. emotive issues of religion and caste competed with that of development and the attacks by the two parties often turned personal as leaders indulged in name-calling. the congress, in political wilderness in gujarat for nearly 22 years, is desperate to break the jinx. it has raised questions on the bjp’s gujarat “development model”, demonetisation and gst. the bjp is banking on its performance and modi’s popularity to counter any anti-incumbency or impact of the patidar quota stir. modi has attacked the congress over the issue of dynastic politics and corruption and invoked ‘gujarati pride’ in his campaign speeches. while modi addressed about 15 rallies, gandhi spent more than seven days in saurashtra and south gujarat, addressing a number of meetings and emerging as the congress pivot to take on the prime minister on his home turf. agencies ",gujarat polls : 68 % voter turnout

(follow the tribune on facebook; and twitter @thetribunechd) at a rally in harij in patan district, gandhi said modi raised the issue of suspended congress leader mani shankar aiyar’s remark about him as the pm had got exposed on other issues like the narmada water, other backward castes (obc) and development in 22 years of the bjp rule in the state. “it is very interesting to see how the truth catches up with the people. modiji started saying he will contest the election on the issue of narmada water. it came to notice that the river water did not reach villages and went to the tata nano factory,” he claimed. ; “after 2-3 days, he said he will contest election on the issue of obcs. even that did not work,” gandhi added. thereafter, modi declared he will contest on the basis of 22 years of development. it, too, did not bear fruit. “after that modiji says, ‘mani sankar aiyar said a bad thing about me, so this will be my election issue’,” he remarked. referring to a report, gandhi denounced the modi government for spending “rs 3,700 crore in advertisements”. “as per a figure yesterday, the modi government has spent rs 3,700 crore in advertisements. so all the money (of this government) is going in building its image and to industrialists,” he said. “our government will use that money for your health and education,” the congress vice-president said. referring to allegations about amit shah’s son jay shah’s company turnover and rafale fighter jet deal, gandhi said modi did not raise the issue of corruption in the entire election campaign. “modiji cannot escape from rafale or jay shah issues, whatever he may say (in election rallies). even if he does not talk about corruption in his 200 speeches, the pm cannot escape this. gujarat has decided that the next government will not be of the industrialists, but will be of the poor, farmers, labourers, and small businessmen,” he said. “the truth has caught up with modiji. the pm has only one thing left with him. he spoke yesterday and for 60-70 per cent of the time he talked about me. but this election is not about modiji, rahulji, solanki, bjp or congress, but about the future of the people of gujarat,” he said. gandhi said during canvassing he will focus on 22 years of the bjp rule in the state during which the ruling party “worked for 5-10 industrialists” and “snatched land from farmers to hand over to tata nano.” “the congress allocated rs 35,000 crore to mnrega, while the bjp government gave rs 33,000 crore to the tata nano factory. water from the narmada went to that factory. the factory gets electricity for 24 hours even when you get it only at night,” he alleged. land from villages in mundra was given to (gautam) adani at re 1 per metre rate, which the latter sold back to the government for rs 3,000 per metre, he alleged. “last year, the nda government waived rs 1.30 lakh crore of loans of the 10 richest people. farmers also ask for loan waiver, and (union finance minister) arun jaitley and the prime minister say it is not their policy,” gandhi said. he promised a complete loan waiver to farmers as soon as the congress formed government in the state. “i promise that the congress will get you the right price (for your produce) and will also let you know in advance how much you are going to get,” he said. gandhi said a congress government will also spend money on improving health care facilities and education in the state. attacking the government on demonetisation and the goods and services tax, he alleged the winter session of parliament was delayed because the pm did not want to answer questions on gst and note ban. pti ",modi changing agenda gujarat polls getting exposed : rahul,"patan , december 9 congress vice-president rahul gandhi saturday accused prime minister narendra modi changing agenda gujarat elections getting “exposed ” one issue another.

2017-12-10,rural-urban divide over hardik patel among patidar youth,"amreli (gujarat), december 10 patidars, whose movement for job reservation has created a stir in gujarat in the last few years, are a divided lot with youth in the rural areas appearing to be providing strong support to their leader hardik patil, while those in urban areas may not be that enthusiastic about him. travelling through patidar-dominated areas in mehsana, amreli, vadodara and surat, a visiting ians correspondent found the reaction mixed in the community — divided between supporters and opponents of hardik patel, the 24-year-old youth leader who has created a storm in the state. youngsters in rural areas appear to be hard-core supporters of hardik patel while in urban pockets, the community seems to be divided between the bjp and hardik-led paatidar anaamat andolan samiti (paas) fighting for reservation for the affluent and landed patels. deepak bhai patel, who runs a medical shop in the mehsana assembly constituency in mehsana district, the bastion of the patidar community and a bjp citadel, said that the community needs reservations because those who come from families with small landholdings are in a poor condition and need justice. when reminded about the constitutional cap of 50 per cent on reservations, he said: ""kuch na kuch rasta niklega (some way will be found). if they don't find a way, they will suffer as elections will come again "". mehsana is the home district of prime minister narendra modi and deputy chief minister nitin patel represents it in the assembly. patel is locked in a tough contest against congress candidate jivabhai patel, a former mp. ; a patidar youth in surat, amit patel, said: ""anamat mile na mile, bhai bhai ko hi favour karega (we may or may not get reservations but a brother will only favour his brother)"". however, there are youths like parvej patel and chirag patel, who are not bothered about reservations. parvej patel, a chartered accountant in vadodara, said: ""patidars here are affluent. most of them are in business and they don't care about education. their priority is business. so where does reservation matter to them?"" chirag patel, a businessman in surat, said: ""we want security and the bjp provides that. due to gst, we faced a lot of trouble, but they are taking corrective measures too. it will benefit us and the country as well in the long term"". despite anger and displeasure with the bjp, there are many like parvej and chirag who vow to vote for the saffron party to keep the congress out of power, as they feel they would be insecure if the bjp loses. there are many assembly constituencies in mehsana, surat and amreli that have been witnessing a pitched battle between the bjp and the patidars. patidars are categorised under various sub-castes dominated by leuva and kadva, who claim their ancestry to the sons of lord ram: luv and kush. leuva patels claim that they are the descendants of luv, lord ram's elder son, and kadvas of kush, the younger son. since hardik patel is a kadva patel, he has been successful in mobilising them. he has formed committees of youth patidars in many of the villages. worried by the hardik factor, the bjp is leaving no stone unturned to woo the obcs. in saurashtra, north and south gujarat, patidars hold the key in many of the seats and an overwhelming majority of them had been supporters of the bjp in previous elections, but this time many from the community have joined hands with hardik, which is likely to benefit the congress. a discussion at a tea stall in the sardar circle area of amreli in saurashtra presented a typical scene that is prevalent in the state. the discussion took an ugly turn when journalists sought to know the mood of the patidars. pareek sohaliya, a b.com student, claimed that paresh dhanani, the congress candidate, would win as he has the support of the patidars. ""a lot of development work has been initiated by paresh bhai. he has defeated bjp ministers like purshottam rupala and dilip bhai sanghani. this time, the bjp candidate will lose his deposit,"" sohaliya, a patidar, said. but balji bhai, also a patidar, countered his claim.

2017-12-11,"change, evms talk of town","geetanjali gayatri  vadodara/ahmedabad, dec 10 as campaigning gathers steam for the second phase of polling scheduled for december 14 and people mark their loyalties in rural areas with party flags fluttering atop their homes, two things can be said with certainty about this assembly election — gujarat seems desperate for change, almost restless, and nobody trusts the electronic voting machines (evms). the 22 years of the bjp rule in the state has left the gujaratis craving for a change that has, so far, eluded them. however, they believe this election, in the past many years, is different from the cakewalk of the past for the bjp. for starters, the congress seems to have, finally, arrived on the scene after a “marginalised” existence, making it a closely fought bi-polar contest. this election also stamps the leadership credentials of party vice-president rahul gandhi who, in the driver’s seat, seems “a man with a job on hand”. “rahul, practically his party’s face this election has been accepted as a leader which is essentially why the congress is in the game this time round,” political observers maintain. ; though this is also the first assembly election the state bjp is fighting without prime minister narendra modi at the helm in the state, he is extensively touring the state to win support for his party. anti-incumbency dovetailed with the rise of hardik patel as the face of the patidar-discontent and modi-baiter, the consolidation of the dalits under jignesh mevani and the coming together of the obcs under alpesh thakor have all added to the bjp’s long list of woes. if that is not all, the snub of demonetisation to the common man, gst blow to the state’s trading community and the spurt in the unemployment are weighing the bjp down. “traders are sore with the gst rollout and business has taken a beating. demonetisation hit everybody hard. the congress is making its presence felt effectively and has roped in the ‘anti-bjp’ brigade for support. all these put together augur poorly for the bjp which is sweating it out in the field,” says indukumar jani, executive president of the gujarat khet vikas parishad. gujaratis believe this is the one election which could turn into a “game-changer” where the bjp can get buried under its own weight. in the eyes of the common man, the evms are suspect. “the confidence with which the bjp is declaring it will win raises serious doubts. the evms are, after all, machines which can be programmed and tampered with. nobody has faith in them,” explains ahmedabad’s ashok kumar, speaking on behalf of his friends as they discuss politics. the people’s union for civil liberties even represented to the chief election commissioner against the use of evms. “we urged them to replace the evms with ballot papers. the recently concluded uttar pradesh local bodies’ election results have shown that substituting evms with ballot papers can throw up completely different results. the bjp did poorly in places where ballots were used,” said prof hemant kumar shah, associated with the pucl. the bjp leaders, however, are not convinced about any anti-incumbency factor against the bjp or the doubts over the evms. state leaders term this as propaganda of the opposition headed for a rout. “this is the most convenient excuse with the opposition because we are winning,” says yamal vyas of the state bjp.","change , evms talk town","geetanjali gayatri vadodara/ahmedabad , dec 10 campaigning gathers steam second phase polling scheduled december 14 people mark loyalties rural areas party flags fluttering atop homes , two things said certainty assembly election — gujarat seems desperate change , almost restless , nobody trusts electronic voting machines ( evms ) . 22 years bjp rule state left gujaratis craving change , far , eluded them. however , believe election , past many years , different cakewalk past bjp. starters , congress seems , finally , arrived scene “marginalised ” existence , making closely fought bi-polar contest. election also stamps leadership credentials party vice-president rahul gandhi , driver ’ seat , seems “a man job hand ” . “rahul , practically party ’ face election accepted leader essentially congress game time round , ” political observers maintain. ;

""what he is saying is not true. i am looking for a good job,"" mehbub says, his voice choking with anguish and a sense of shame. later, walking towards his shanty on the fringes of the town, mehbub narrates how circumstances forced him to quit studies after high school. his father is a driver, who earns rs 5,000 per month. minutes later, mehbub, in a manner nearly identical to parmar, inquires about this correspondent's job profile, qualifications and salary. ""did they also pay you separately for this trip over and above the salary? do they have entrance exams for the job?"" mehbub asks. en route to patan's sami tehsil, deepakbhai devipujak, a resident of the district's baspa village, pulls out his china-made tablet to show images of devastation caused by the july 2017 floods in his area. ""all our standing crop was levelled by the surge of water. and till date we have not received compensation for the loss despite numerous promises by the authorities,"" he says. deepak says he will pursue a law degree, in accordance with his farmer father's wish. however, only reservations can ensure a government job that can secure his future, he affirms. ""our caste numbers around 1.5 crore across the country. we are listed as backward castes by the gujarat government. but we want reservations to end the discrimination against us and ensure our proper representation in the government,"" he says. the devipujak community, listed among the nomadic tribes and denotified tribes in gujarat, fall in the obc category. but they have been demanding a separate quota within the 27 per cent reservation for obcs as they are too marginalised to compete with other groups. in vadgam constituency's chhapi village, bhawesh kumar echoes a similar sense of despair. the 29-year-old, who has completed his ma and bed, is desperately seeking a government job but runs a mobile repairing shop out of necessity. these voices have little presence in the prevailing political discourse of the state, saddled by raging debates on wild conspiracy theories and a heady dose of religious polarisation. the patidar agitation for reservations, led by hardik patel, reflected similar frustration even among the youth of the landed patel community. according to the rbi's handbook of statistics, gujarat's growth driven by capital-intensive industries has not generated adequate amount of jobs, and in recent years the rate of manufacturing output has steadily fallen. small and medium-scale enterprises have also shut shop more than ever before, especially after the introduction of gst and demonetisation, resulting in further shrinking of job opportunities, data reveals. will gujarat's youth make their presence felt in this election? counting day on december 18 should provide some answers. pti ","gujarat , recurring question , jobs gone ?","radhanpur/patan/vadgam , december 12 state highways smooth journeys long arduous. take refuge smartphones , mostly encased plastic , shutting rest world. occasional chuckle youngsters sound leaking ear plugs give hint source entertainment - mostly video clips bollywood flicks , regional albums comedy clips. prince parmar one bus , travelling gandhidham , town kutch district , patan town. 23-year-old youth , son landless farmer , works "" supervisor "" garments company gandhidham meagre salary rs 10,000 per month. ; "" deduct half salary take even three days , "" parmar , dalit , says. sharing angst frustration , parmar suddenly asks , "" much earn ? study ?

2017-12-16,rahul gandhi: from ‘reluctant prince’ to new hope for moribund party,"new delhi, december 16 once dubbed the ""reluctant prince"", rahul gandhi on saturday took over the reins of the congress, signalling not just the coming of age of the heir apparent, but a generational change in the 132-year-old party. the new party president, the sixth member of the nehru- gandhi family to lead the political outfit, takes charge from his mother sonia gandhi at a time when the party is facing one of its worst crises, with the bjp occupying the centrestage of national and state politics. but the 47-year-old amethi mp, formally elevated to the party president's post today, has taken the narendra modi government on with a renewed vigour of late. observers believe his demeanour has changed in the last few months. dressed in his white kurta and pyjamas, wearing sneakers and a jacket in winter, he looks more mature and speaks a language that connects with the people. he has been taking potshots at the modi government on twitter, often using colourful and popular cultural idioms. ; the gandhi scion has described the goods and services tax (gst) as the ""gabbar singh tax"", called the government a ""suit-boot ki sarkar"", referred to a ""fair and lovely tax"" and even brought in his dog, piddi, to score political brownie points. though it has often been said that he lacks the charisma of his mother and grandmother, or the ease with which his younger sister, priyanka, reaches out to people, gandhi has seemingly found his feet and confidence. for the younger leaders of the party, he spells hope in the current political maelstrom, but gandhi has also said he will take the old guard, along with the new. ""every post comes with a challenge. he has to rebuild the party at the grassroots and strengthen its ideological base,"" said sushmita dev, a close confidant of rahul gandhi and one of the young leaders of the party. the 17th congress president since independence was ushered to the centrestage of politics when he won from amethi in uttar pradesh in 2004, a seat which was represented by his father rajiv gandhi and mother sonia gandhi in the lok sabha earlier, and made his first mark in parliament when he spoke passionately about vidarbha farm widow kalavati. for, while politics may or may not have been his calling, it is certainly in his blood. starting from his great-great grandfather motilal nehru, the congress has been tightly held by his ancestors, including great grandfather jawaharlal nehru, grandmother indira gandhi, father rajiv gandhi and mother sonia gandhi, who steered the party for a record 19 years in a row. the party had made rahul gandhi its general secretary in 2007 and vice-president in 2013. his easy elevation was not surprising, given the tacit understanding within the party that the mantle must pass from one gandhi to another. in the early years, it had seemed that the man who had seen the assassination of his grandmother as a teenager and that of his father as a young adult, wanted to steer clear of the murky world of politics. gandhi, who went to st stephen's college in delhi, rollins college in florida and trinity college, cambridge, joined the monitor group, a consulting group in london, where he worked for three years. but after that, it had to be back home, to the political role carved out for him. his leadership in elections has so far been dismal. since he became the congress vice president in 2013, the party has lost power in state after state and is left with only five currently. but congress leaders hope he would draw the party out of quagmire and onward to success. ""i see hope and confidence in rahul,"" said punjab chief minister amarinder singh, who was his father's friend. the ""reluctant prince"" -- as he was dubbed by sections of the media -- is now seemingly raring to go. congressmen refer to his address to the students in berkley, us, when he boldly took questions, even on dynastic politics, to underline his new-found confidence. the bjp has also started taking rahul gandhi seriously of late, often fielding a host of ministers to counter the congress leader, who started tweeting a question every day to modi, quizzing him on a wide range of subjects, in the run-up to the recent assembly polls. his first litmus test is gujarat and it has to be seen if his hard work in steering the party's vigorous campaign will pay off. though exit polls predict a victory for the bjp in gujarat and himachal pradesh, top congress leaders feel if their party wins or significantly improves its position in gujarat, rahul gandhi's leadership will be established. a party leader said rahul gandhi's next challenge would be to cobble together electoral alliances. he would have to handle the rough and tumble of 24x7 politics and take on aggressive rivals such as modi and bjp president amit shah.

2017-12-21,upward movement of global economy to help india: jaitley,"new delhi, december 21 finance minister arun jaitley on thursday exuded confidence that the upward movement of the global economy will also help india which has been growing at the “new normal” growth rate of 7-8 per cent. replying to a debate on the second batch of supplementary demands of grants in the lok sabha, he said the decision to bring petroleum products under the goods and services tax (gst) will be taken by the gst council. the lower house later approved the supplementary demands envisaging a total additional expenditure of about rs 66,113 crore, of which net outgo would be rs 33,379 crore. the minister also took a dig at the congress, saying that there was no talk of ‘gabbar singh tax’ when the overall indirect tax rate was 31 to 31.5 per cent on average before introduction of the gst. “when you imposed 31.5 per cent tax (including excise, vat, cst and cascading effect), nobody remembered the gabbar singh tax. now tax rate is only 18 per cent,” jaitley said. ; during the election campaign in gujarat, congress leader rahul gandhi had dubbed the gst as ‘gabbar singh tax’. on the issue of inclusion of petroleum goods in the gst regime, jaitley dared the congress party to ask their chief ministers in five states to openly say that they favour gst on petroleum goods. he further said that petroleum goods are zero rated under the gst and a decision would be taken by the gst council on whether to bring them under the new tax regime. the government, he said, could not have postponed gst rollout as it was constitutionally binding to have the new tax regime by september 16, 2017. he also assured the house that no state will lose revenue on account of implementation of gst as there is a guarantee by the centre to compensate them for 5 years. referring to the global economy, jaitley said there was a “visible reversal” and upwards movement will help india which has grown by 7-8 per cent, a new normal, in the past three-and -half years. the global economy is expected to grow by 3.6 per cent in 2017 and 3.7 per cent next year. jaitley further said during the last three-and-half years, the government has been able to bring down the fiscal deficit, current account deficit, contain inflation and stabilise exchange rate. he further said the government has enacted a law mandating monetary policy committee to maintain inflation at 4 per cent plus/minus 2 per cent. inflation has already come down from double digits during the upa regime to 2-2.5 per cent and is very much within the 4 per cent limit, he said. the rise in inflation last month can be attributed to three factors—vegetable price rise after rain, surge in crude oil prices and disbursement of allowances to central government employees, he added. observing that india no more suffers from policy paralysis and fear of being part of the ‘fragile five’ global economies, jaitley said “india is a bright spot, sweet spot, fastest growing major economy in the world”. he further said the structural reforms—gst and demonetisation—have temporarily slowed down the economy but they will accelerate growth in the coming years as happened after the launch of liberalisation in 1991. on the deteriorating bad loans position of banks, jaitley said it was mainly on account of the loans given to industry prior to 2014. the government has taken various initiatives, including the bankruptcy code that will make industrialists stand in queue for bankruptcy, he said, adding banks are being recapitalised to the tune of rs 2.11 lakh crore. on the disinvestment of air india, he said it was unfair to ask taxpayers to bear the burden of rs 55,000 crore debt for running of the national carrier. “there is a right time to privatise otherwise nothing will be left to privatise,” he said. — pti ",upward movement global economy help india : jaitley,"new delhi , december 21 finance minister arun jaitley thursday exuded confidence upward movement global economy also help india growing “new normal ” growth rate 7-8 per cent. replying debate second batch supplementary demands grants lok sabha , said decision bring petroleum products goods services tax ( gst ) taken gst council. lower house later approved supplementary demands envisaging total additional expenditure rs 66,113 crore , net outgo would rs 33,379 crore. minister also took dig congress , saying talk ‘gabbar singh tax ’ overall indirect tax rate 31 31.5 per cent average introduction gst. “when imposed 31.5 per cent tax ( including excise , vat , cst cascading effect ) , nobody remembered gabbar singh tax. tax rate 18 per cent , ” jaitley said. ;

""the delay in disbursing refunds means your capital is blocked. the committee's report said the (quantum of) blocked capital (stuck up with the government for refunds) could be between 15-20 per cent of the working capital. declining of the working capital would lead to losing of jobs by the workers,"" mitra pointed.

2017-12-26,low-profile rss man vijay rupani back at the helm,"ahmedabad, december 26 vijay rupani, a low-profile rss man who has the trust of bjp president amit shah, is back in the chief minister's chair after having survived the incumbency factor and a violent quota stir by the patidars. born in rangoon (now yangon, myanmar) rupani, 61, joined an rss shakha as a schoolboy, before graduating to the bjp via the sangh's students wing — the akhil bharatiya vidyarthi parishad (abvp). though prime minister narendra modi was the bjp's face in the high-octane election campaign in his home state, rupani, belonging to the relatively small jain community, steered the party machinery in gujarat, neutralising the incumbency factor against his government and surviving quota stir by the patidar community, the bedrock of the party's support base. that he also successfully contained disenchantment with the government over farm distress in some parts of the state, and economic slowdown due to demonetisation and roll out of the goods and services tax (gst), also stood him in good stead. despite the bjp's tally falling below 100 in a long time, rupani's selection also suggested that the top party leadership wanted continuity before the 2019 lok sabha polls. ; though only a second-time mla, he made a mark as an able administrator. rupani, who worked mostly in the party organisation in gujarat, fought his first assembly election in 2014, winning a by-poll from rajkot west. this time he won from the same seat with an impressive margin of over 53,000 votes. a bachelor of law, rupani was a rajya sabha member between 2006 and 2012. it was under him as chairman of the gujarat tourism development corporation in 2006 that the hugely successful advertisement campaign 'khushboo gujarat ki', featuring megastar amitabh bachchan, was launched to promote the state as a tourism hotspot. he was also the chairman of the gujarat municipal finance board in 2013. when the rajkot west seat fell vacant in october 2014 after speaker of the assembly vajubhai vala was appointed the karnataka governor, rupani won the by-poll. on february 19, 2016, he was appointed the chief of the gujarat bjp. it was seen as a victory for the amit shah camp in the state unit. when the state's first and only woman chief minister anandiben patel resigned in august 2016 following allegations of inept handling of the patidar and dalit agitations, rupani was catapulted to the hot seat. rupani honed his political skills in the crucible of the gujarat navnirman agitation, a socio-political movement in 1974 by students and the middle-class against economic crisis and corruption in public life. it soon spread elsewhere, particularly in bihar, where socialist legend jayaprakash narayan gave a call for 'total revolution'. the movement finally led to the fall of indira gandhi government and installation of the first non-congress dispensation at the centre under morarji desai. rupani, who was then with the abvp, was jailed for nearly a year during emergency. as the mayor of rajkot in 1996-97, he endeared himself to people of the city with his initiatives for improvement of the civic infrastructure. rupani's mettle as a politician will be tested again in the 2019 lok sabha polls when modi bids for a second shot at power. delivering gujarat to the bjp is the least he would expect from amit shah's man in gandhinagar. pti",low-profile rss man vijay rupani back helm,"ahmedabad , december 26 vijay rupani , low-profile rss man trust bjp president amit shah , back chief minister ' chair survived incumbency factor violent quota stir patidars. born rangoon ( yangon , myanmar ) rupani , 61 , joined rss shakha schoolboy , graduating bjp via sangh ' students wing — akhil bharatiya vidyarthi parishad ( abvp ) . though prime minister narendra modi bjp ' face high-octane election campaign home state , rupani , belonging relatively small jain community , steered party machinery gujarat , neutralising incumbency factor government surviving quota stir patidar community , bedrock party ' support base. also successfully contained disenchantment government farm distress parts state , economic slowdown due demonetisation roll goods services tax ( gst ) , also stood good stead. despite bjp ' tally falling 100 long time , rupani ' selection also suggested top party leadership wanted continuity 2019 lok sabha polls. ;

(follow the tribune on facebook; and twitter @thetribunechd) to materialise its potential, india, kose said, needed to take steps to boost investment prospects. there were measures under way to do in terms of non-performing loans and productivity, he said. “on the productivity side, india has enormous potential with respect to secondary education completion rate. all in all, improved labour market reforms, education and health reforms as well as relaxing investment bottleneck will help improve india’s prospects,” kose said. noting that india had a favourable demographic profile, he said it is rarely seen in other economies. “in that context, improving female labour force participation rate is going to be important. female labour force participation still remains low relative to other emerging market economies. bringing force right now idle outside of the productive activities will make a huge difference,” he said. reducing youth unemployment is critical, and pushing for private investment, where problems are already well-known like bank assets quality issues...if these are done, india can reach its potential easily and exceed, kose asserted. “in fact, we expect india to do better than its potential in 2018 and move forward,” he said. india’s growth potential, he said, would be around 7 per cent for the next 10 years. the indian government is “very serious” with gst being a major turning point and banking recapitalisation programme is really important, kose said. “the indian government has already recognised some of these problems and is undertaking measures and is willing to see the outcomes of these measures,” he said. “india is a very large economy. it has a huge potential. at the same time, it has its own challenges. this government is very much aware of these challenges and is showing just doing its best in terms of dealing with them,” the world bank official said. the latest world bank growth estimate for 2017 is 0.5 per cent, less than the previous projection, and 0.2 per cent less in the next two years. “it is slightly lower than its previous forecast, primarily because india is undertaking major reforms,” kose said. these reforms, of course, would bring certain policy uncertainty, he said, “but the big issue about india, when you look at india’s growth potential and our numbers down the road 2019 and 2020, is that it is going to be the fastest growing large emerging market”. “india has an ambitious government undertaking comprehensive reforms. gst is a major reform to have harmonised taxes, is one nation one market one tax concept. then, of course, the late 2016 demonetisation reform was there. the government is well aware of these short-term implications,” kose said. he said there might have been some temporary disruptions but “all in all” the indian economy had done well. “the potential growth rate of the indian economy is very healthy to 7 per cent. i think the growth is going to be at a high rate going forward,” the world bank official said. the big question is whether indian policymakers would, under the necessary reforms, push its potential growth up, kose said. “so far we have seen ambitious policy initiatives and implementation like gst. and we have all the reasons to expect this government to continue economic policies to create friendly environment for businesses and push its growth potential up,” he said. in a south asia regional press release, the world bank said india is estimated to grow 6.7 per cent in fiscal year 2017-18, slightly down from the 7.1 per cent of the previous fiscal year. this is due in part to the effects of the introduction of the goods and services tax, but also to protracted balance sheet weaknesses, including corporate debt burdens and non-performing loans in the banking sector, weighing down private investment, it said. pti ","wb says india huge potential , projects 7.3 pc growth 2018","washington , january 10 “ambitious government undertaking comprehensive reforms ” , india “enormous growth potential ” compared emerging economies , world bank said wednesday , projected country ’ growth rate 7.3 per cent 2018 7.5 next two years. india , despite initial setbacks demonetisation goods services tax ( gst ) , estimated grown 6.7 per cent 2017 , according 2018 global economics prospect released world bank wednesday. “in likelihood india going register higher growth rate major emerging market economies next decade. , ’ focus short-term numbers. would look big picture india big picture telling us enormous potential , ” ayhan kose , director , development prospects group , world bank , told pti interview. ; said comparison china , slowing , world bank expecting india gradually accelerate. “the growth numbers past three years healthy , ” kose , author report , said. 2017 , china grew 6.8 per cent , 0.1 per cent india , 2018 , growth rate projected 6.4 per cent. next two years , country ’ growth rate drop marginally 6.3 6.2 per cent , respectively.

2018-01-29,climate change may cut farm income by 20-25%: economic survey,"new delhi, january 29 climate change could adversely affect farmers’ income by up to 20-25 per cent in the medium term, the economic survey warned and suggested the need for “dramatic” improvement in irrigation, use of new technologies and better targeting of power and fertiliser subsidies. (follow the tribune on facebook; and twitter @thetribunechd) the government has also been recommended to take “radical follow-up action” to achieve its objective of addressing agricultural stress and doubling farmers’ income. since agriculture is a state subject and an open political economy question, the survey strongly advocated a mechanism similar to the gst council to bring more reforms in the agriculture sector and boost farmers’ income. “climate change — whose imprint on indian agriculture is already visible — might reduce farm incomes by up to 20-25 per cent in the medium term,” the survey for 2017-18 said. ; climate change could reduce annual farm incomes in the range of 15-18 per cent on average, and up to 20-25 per cent for unirrigated areas, it said. at current levels of farm income, that translates into more than rs 3,600 per year for the median farm household, the survey estimated. “minimising susceptibility to climate change requires drastically extending irrigation via efficient drip and sprinkler technologies, and replacing untargeted subsidies in power and fertiliser by direct income support,” the survey said, while calling for review of cereal-centric farm policy. india needs to spread irrigation and do so against a backdrop of rising water scarcity and depleting groundwater resources, it said. at present, about 45 per cent of farm land is under irrigation. the indo-gangetic plain, and parts of gujarat and madhya pradesh are well irrigated. but parts of karnataka, maharashtra, madhya pradesh, rajasthan, chattisgarh and jharkhand are still extremely vulnerable to climate change on account of not being well irrigated. the survey further said that fully irrigating indian agriculture, that too against the backdrop of water scarcity and limited efficiency in existing irrigation schemes, will be a defining challenge for the future. technologies of drip irrigation, sprinklers, and water management—captured in the “more crop for every drop” campaign—may well hold the key to future indian agriculture and hence should be accorded greater priority in resource allocation, it said. and, of course, the power subsidy needs to be replaced by direct benefit transfers so that power use can be fully cost and water conservation furthered, it added. stating that the climate change will increase farmer uncertainty, the survey called for an effective crop insurance and embrace farm science and technology with renewed ardour. “building on the current crop insurance program pradhan mantri fasal bima yojana, weather-based models and technologies like drones need to be used to determine losses and compensate farmers within weeks,” it said. stating that the agri-sector is experiencing structural changes leading to new challenges and opportunities, the survey said that the farm sector will remain an engine of broad based growth even as its share in gross value addition (gva) is on the decline. the central priority of the government will be to provide opportunities for farmers to diversify their income generating opportunities to reduce the various risks by facilitating the development of agriculture sub-sectors like livestock and fisheries, it observed. pti",climate change may cut farm income 20-25 % : economic survey,"new delhi , january 29 climate change could adversely affect farmers ’ income 20-25 per cent medium term , economic survey warned suggested need “dramatic ” improvement irrigation , use new technologies better targeting power fertiliser subsidies.

2018-01-30,7-7.5% growth projected in 2018-19,"sanjeev sharma  new delhi, january 29 while identifying employment, education and agriculture as core focus areas, the economic survey for 2017-18 has projected a recovery in the growth rate of the economy to 7-7.5 per cent in the next fiscal as the impact of demonetisation and goods and services tax (gst) wanes. the economic survey for 2017-18 presented in parliament by finance minister arun jaitley two days before the government’s fifth and final union budget has pegged the growth rate for the current fiscal at 6.75 per cent as recovery picked up in the second half. edit: guarded growth ; the survey document for this year comes in pink colour, which highlights gender issues against the backdrop of development. the survey has highlighted that against the emerging macro-economic concerns, policy vigilance will be necessary in the coming year, especially if high international oil prices persist or elevated stock prices correct sharply, provoking a “sudden stall” in capital flows. on the agenda for the next year, the survey has listed supporting agriculture, stabilising the gst, completing the twin balance sheet (tbs) actions, privatising air india, and staving off threats to macro-economic stability. calling for the need to revive investments rather than savings, the survey seeks to achieve economic growth on the strength of the only two truly sustainable engines — private investment and exports. the survey has also called for utmost priority to social infrastructure like education, health and social protection to engineer an inclusive and sustainable growth. it has called for timely dispute resolution, including tax litigation. all these pointers in the survey indicate that the budget is likely to focus on these areas in the final year before the 2019 general election. chief economic adviser arvind subramanian said there has been a boost in registered direct and indirect taxpayers. this includes a 50 per cent increase in unique indirect taxpayers under the gst compared to the pre-gst system and an addition of about 1.8 million individual income tax filers since demonetisation in november 2016. the survey noted that the sum of all government efforts increased income tax collections, thus far, between rs 65,000 and rs 90,000 crore. these numbers imply a substantial increase in reported incomes (and hence in formalisation) of about 1.5 per cent to 2.3 per cent of the gdp. girish vanvari, national head of tax, kpmg (india), said it will be interesting to note how the government responds to the popular expectations of lower tax rates at individual and corporate tax levels especially in the light of an increasing tax base post gst and demonetisation. among the big novel ideas mooted in the survey is the “technology of gst council”. subramanian said the gst council is akin to “technology of reform”, the principle needs to be applied for reform in many other areas. for example, the “cooperative federalism technology” of the gst council could be used to create a common agricultural market, integrate fragmented and inefficient electricity markets, solve interstate water disputes, implement direct benefit transfers (dbt), make access to social benefits portable across states, and combat air pollution. fiscal indicators and forecast inflation average retail inflation declined to six-year low of 3.3 per cent in 2017-18, with the economy moving towards a more stable price regime tax disputes separate hc benches recommended for tax cases to prune pendency. claims for indirect and direct tax in litigation stood at rs 7.58 lakh cr by march 2017 employment real estate and construction sector will create over 15 million jobs over next five years despite signs of stress in the segment in last few quarters demonetisation has encouraged financial savings tax collection by states, local govts lower than those in other federal countries insolvency code being actively used to resolve npa woes policy vigilance needed if oil prices stay high or stock prices correct sharply foreign exchange reserves grew by 14.1% from end of dec 2016 to end of dec 2017 climate change has had an adverse impact on agricultural yields swachh bharat initiative improved sanitation coverage in rural areas from 39% to 76% indian society exhibits a strong desire for a male child survey in pink colour to highlight gender issues cea: crony socialism to stigmatised capitalism the last 50-60 years have seen a shift in attitude from what i call crony socialism to stigmatised capitalism. —arvind subramanian, cea in 2 yrs, universal basic income: govt chief economic adviser arvind subramanian expressed hope that at least one or two states will implement the idea of universal basic income (ubi) in the next two years. subramanian in the economic survey 2016-17 had mooted the idea of universal basic income or a uniform stipend paid to every adult and child, poor or rich. “i can bet... within the next two years, at least one or two states will implement ubi,” subramanian said.",7-7.5 % growth projected 2018-19,"sanjeev sharma new delhi , january 29 identifying employment , education agriculture core focus areas , economic survey 2017-18 projected recovery growth rate economy 7-7.5 per cent next fiscal impact demonetisation goods services tax ( gst ) wanes. economic survey 2017-18 presented parliament finance minister arun jaitley two days government ’ fifth final union budget pegged growth rate current fiscal 6.75 per cent recovery picked second half. edit : guarded growth ;

2018-01-30,climate change can sow agri distress,"vibha sharma  new delhi, january 29identifying agriculture as one of the focus areas along with employment and education, the economic survey has advocated “dramatic” improvement in irrigation, new technologies and replacing untargeted subsidies in power and fertiliser by direct income support for sustaining the sector. more broadly the cereal-centricity of current policy needs to be reviewed, it said. the last few seasons have witnessed a problem of plenty — the farm revenue is declining for a number of crops despite increasing production and market prices falling below the minimum support price (msp). (follow the tribune on facebook; and twitter @thetribunechd) ; productivity will have to be increased, and price and income volatility reduced, against the backdrop of increasing resource constraints. climate change, as per the survey, could reduce annual farm incomes in the range of 15-18 per cent on average, and up to 20-25 per cent for un-irrigated areas. india needs to spread irrigation and do so against a backdrop of rising water scarcity. at present, about 45 per cent of the farm land is under irrigation. “climate change — whose imprint on the indian agriculture is already visible — might reduce farm incomes by up to 20-25 per cent in the medium term,” it warns. in terms of money, this translates into more than rs 3,600 a year for the median farm household. the observations are significant in the backdrop of the narendra modi government’s aim to double the farmers’ income by 2022. as per the economic report card of the government for 2017-18, extreme temperature shocks reduce farmer incomes by 4.3 per cent and 4.1 per cent during kharif and rabi seasons, respectively, whereas extreme rainfall reduces incomes by 13.7 per cent and 5.5 per cent, respectively. shortages of water and land, deterioration in soil quality, and of course climate change-induced temperature increases and rainfall variability, are all going to impact agriculture. it is therefore opportune to analyse the effects of climate on indian agriculture, it says. since agriculture is a state subject and an open political economy question, a mechanism similar to the gst council is required to bring more reforms in the agriculture sector and boost farmers’ income.

; this whole myth about bjp being an election winning machine, propaganda they have done about their might and well-oiled machinery that can take on any challenge, that myth has been put to rest comprehensively now. these elections signify not just blatant rejection of vasundhara raje’s government but also bjp’s policies-whether it is gst, notebandi, agrarian distress. was it a surprise that late sanwar lal jat’s son lost? here is the double speak. bjp always blames the congress for dynasty politics. sanwar lalji who is no more, his son is a non-political person. he was given a ticket just because he is son of sanwar lal. they also wanted to use caste because his caste would vote for him. unlike any other cm, vasundhara raje for the first time held caste-wise meetings. so she would call brahmins, rajputs, malis, meenas, gujjars and so on at separate times. first they tried dividing society along religious lines. now they are dividing it on caste lines. but did caste calculations force congress to maintain silence on padmaavat row? let me make it very clear. as far as i am concerned, anybody, any group, organisation takes law into their own hands, that is unacceptable. the government of the day must take action. against karni sena too? everybody. but who is in power in rajasthan? bjp. who is in power at centre? bjp. i&b ministry? bjp. gujarat, madhya pradesh, rajasthan, maharashtra -- all bjp governments. you try and do competitive politics and start banning films because you want to get votes of kshatriya community and government of india which is also bjp remains absolutely silent. if vasundhara raje was so concerned about sentiments of rajput community when the movie was being made a year and half ago the issue first came up. she could have found the film producers, organisation that was upset, community that was feeling hurt and found a middle ground to settle the issue. when the film was made and madhya pradesh banned the film, it became competitive politics. congress has said anyone’s sentiments are hurt, we must take cognisance of the fact. but anyone takes law in their own hands that is not acceptable to anyone. is congress unified in rajasthan or is there a gehlot faction, a cp joshi faction? these three victories belong to the people of rajasthan and congress workers who were brave enough to take on the might of the state government. the collective objective of everyone in the party is to ensure that we win the elections. would it not help to project a young, dynamic face like you as cm? there are few aberrations but traditionally congress party has not done. we have a parliamentary democracy so elected mlas will choose their leader along with the aicc. bjp on the other hand has named raman singh, shivraj singh chauhan as cm faces for 2018 polls where they are in power. but i asked in jaipur that why is vasundhara raje not the cm face for 2018. there is a deafening silence. are you possible cm face of rajasthan? my job really was to rebuild the party in rajasthan. we were given a thrashing and had 21 mlas only, lowest ever since independence. four years later i can draw some satisfaction that our efforts have paid off. it has been the entire team of congress leadership, young and old who got us here. will rural economy focus in budget resonate with voters in 2019? their fake love for the farming community has now been aroused because they knew that pushback from agrarian sector is very hard. if they really felt so much for the farming community, four years ago when the first budget was made why were these announcements not made? they gave two lakh crores of concessions to a few corporate houses then. now when elections are round the corner, they are making grand announcements with no money to show and no allocations made. this is a face-saving exercise. do you see a perceptible change in congress under rahul gandhi’s leadership? will opposition rally around it in 2019? nationally, the only party that can take on bjp is congress. we have to work with like-minded parties. as time goes on we will have to find a middle path where we can come together amid state-level competing interests and mount a formidable challenge for 2019. rahul gandhi is our party president. he is leading from the front. his aggressive stand and taking on narendra modi and his policies have given confidence to people of india and to congress workers. he has support not just of people like me, but even of so called party old guard.",myth bjp election-winning machine put rest : pilot,"smita sharma new delhi , february 4 congress leader sachin pilot beaming confidence important win party candidates bypolls lok sabha seats ajmer alwar mandalgarh assembly seat rajasthan recently. meet party president rahul gandhi monday along winners. pilot calls results rejection vasundhara raje ’ caste politics blamed padmaavat row her. believes modi government ’ ‘pro-farmer ’ budgetary announcements symbolic face saving gesture. pilot also claimed rahul gandhi leading front support young well party old guard. excerpts interview : significant message win ?

even the flow of foreign investment has dipped to its lowest level,” the sp chief added. responding to questions on whether his party would be part of the third front and equations with the congress, which seemed to be distancing itself from the sp following the uttar pradesh assembly election, he said the friendship was intact. “our friendship with the congress is still intact. i have a very good rapport with every opposition party and leader. i have not spoken to ‘bua-ji’ (as he often refers to bsp supremo mayawati), but i am on good terms with her too,” he said. on the communal violence in kasganj in uttar pradesh on republic day, the former chief minister said, “it’s good that so many video tapes have surfaced and made it clear what triggered the unfortunate killing. “videos show that persons from one community are proceeding to celebrate republic day, carrying the tricolour in their hands while those from another community are holding saffron flags as well as the tricolour and are trying to stop them.” the bjp’s allegation that the sp was vitiating the atmosphere of communal harmony in uttar pradesh was baseless, yadav said. “if we are doing that, they (the bjp government) should act against us. why they are not doing that?” the sp will soon take out a ‘yatra’ passing through several states, yadav said, without giving further details. — pti ",economic anarchy lead third front 2019 : akhilesh,"mumbai , february 5 samajwadi party chief akhilesh yadav monday said “economic anarchy ” affected sections society likely lead “third front ” bjp ahead next lok sabha elections. former uttar pradesh chief minister also spoke continuing friendship congress “good rapport ” opposition parties , including bahujan samaj party ( bsp ) . “a kind economic anarchy prevailing country. entire country reeling chaos , banks , farmers , businessmen , youths salaried classes .... , every section society suffering lead formation third front ahead lok sabha elections 2019 , ” said. yadav speaking members mumbai hindi patrakar sangh ( mumbai hindi journalists association ) here. bjp , said , gujarat election due gst factor truth large section business community , gujarat across country , angry. ; people yet get dues owing gst roll-out demonetisation , added. yadav , addressed sp rally yesterday , met party workers leaders city maharashtra today. elaborating thinks economic anarchy , yadav asked , “why think government bailing banks ?

eyes on 2019, he wooed the youth, both inside and outside the party. to congress leaders today, he said the party must change if it wanted to lead india once again and also confessed that “in the last few years of our upa government, we didn’t stand up to people’s expectation and they felt let down by us”. to the youth, he extended an invitation to enter politics. “i will break two walls — the wall between congress leaders and workers and the wall between political establishment and indian youth,” he said. using the vacant aicc plenary stage as a symbol of his urge, he said, “you won’t find such empty stages in any party. i have cleared this space for you. only you can change india.” rahul stole the occasion to ask his faction-ridden party to discipline itself “at least until elections”. “you can quarrel after elections,” he joked as his party stands reduced to punjab, karnataka, puducherry and mizoram. he publicly acknowledged that the congress still tolerated parachute candidates and denied the ticket to workers who don’t have money. “no, no, no. you are the workers who carry the congress in your hearts and you will get the party ticket,” promised the congress chief, who had said something similar on becoming the congress vice-president in the jaipur session of the party. nevertheless, it was this repeat promise of justice to workers that fetched him the heaviest applause in his 40-minute hindi-english mixed speech. for most part, the gandhi scion launched a caustic attack on the saffron family, accusing the bjp and the rss of using religion to grab power and of destroying institutions. “like the kauravas, the bjp and the rss are designed to fight for power. like the pandavas, the congress is designed to fight for the truth. the bjp is the voice of one organisation. the congress is the voice of a nation… people can accept a murder accused as the bjp president, but won’t accept the same in the congress,” he said, tearing into bjp chief amit shah. in parts, the congress chief peppered his address with sarcasms like when he said, “farmers are dying, youth have no jobs, but pm modi says let’s do yoga… instead of facing the truth of the crisis caused by gst and demonetisation, the pm diverts attention and never accepts his mistakes.” likens bjp to kauravas rahul gandhi said like the kauravas, the bjp and the rss were designed to fight for power;

2018-04-20,"india's reforms bearing fruit, make case for more steps: imf","washington, april 20 the reforms carried out by india have been bearing fruit and benefiting people, making a strong case for more steps, a top imf official has said. the implementation of the goods and services tax (gst), despite a bumpy road, is going to help secure the solidity of foundation of public finances, david lipton, international monetary fund (imf)’s first deputy managing director david lipton, told pti. the recent steps taken to deal with the accumulated problems in banks are important ones, lipton said, as he identified digital id technology and other structural reforms as important moves towards inclusive growth and making india an economic powerhouse. “there’s certainly more to be done but india is seeing benefits from what it has done,” he said on the sidelines of the spring meeting of the imf and the world bank. “india’s reforms have been bearing fruit and we see that in growth performance. (india’s) growth last year was 6.7 per cent. we’re now projecting 7.4 this fiscal year and 7.8 the following (year). that’s a very healthy acceleration and it really means for a country that is huge, adds up to an awful lot of economic activity. ; “india’s goal is to have sustained growth and to have a growth that boosts the living standards very broadly across the population. the reforms that have been carried out so far have had benefits and make a very good case for carrying forward with further reforms,” lipton said. a country of india’s size has to be very careful to keep public finances under control because any interruption of economic activity that comes from fiscal difficulties would be a setback, he said. strengthening the foundation of fiscal finances with the gst is one reform that stood out, lipton said. asked if these reforms had been inclusive enough, lipton said the eco-system being built around digital id technology offered a big help in this regard. the problem of inclusion in india is particularly a difficult one given the size of the country and the remoteness of much of the population as well as the complexity of some very overburdened urban areas, he said. “there’s been progress, but i think that this is a challenge that has not yet been not solved and may not be solved for a while. but what makes sense is to carry on. “i hope that in india’s case, new technologies, some of which are already being applied can help overcome remoteness and can promote inclusivity, whether it’s retina id numbers system and the architecture of finance and commerce that’s going to be built around that or some of the new fintech innovations that allow people to do commerce or banking, whether it’s savings and earning on their savings or borrowing may be useful for the creation and building businesses through new technologies,” lipton said. the indian government is effectively looking at how technologies can lead to better efficiency and less waste and corruption in government interactions with the people, whether it’s in spending and benefits or the collection of taxes, the senior imf official said. “so, i think in a big country, technology can be a way to leapfrog the more old-fashioned ways in building connectivity that leads to inclusion in the country,” he said. asked about the aadhaar card technology, lipton said it is relatively new and seemed to have many advantages. “it surely has huge promises and could help overcome remoteness and promote inclusion,” he said. there certainly are possible drawbacks, he noted. “from the beginning it’s been clear that issues of privacy and data security are going to arise when you use a technology like this. and it’ll be the societies’ job to figure out the dos and don’ts of that,” he said. “i hope it (india’s progress) will show in poverty reduction statistics and eventually in a measurement of metrics of inclusion. “i’ve said there’s more to be done. there are further reforms both in terms of consolidating the budget situation to ensure that there’s never an incident of doubt about fiscal finances in terms of making the banking system more competitive and dealing with the legacy problems of npas (non- performing assets),” he said. the important job is not just to recapitalise, but to change the governance and change the competitiveness so that banks serve as a positive force, allocating credit well and being a driving force in the economy, he said. asked about imf managing director christine lagarde’s remarks that she did not expect any major economic reforms in an election year, lipton said: “it’s always a difficult to make policy during election years. “we certainly hope that there can continue to be a progress, but it’s really the judgment of the politicians, the government about what can be done when.” “if policies are managed well and reforms are supportive of inclusive growth, india’s economy could become a powerhouse economy. it is already, i think, the 10th largest, but with the population and the growth rate there’s more potential. “the challenges of getting from here to there are very substantial. india needs a process of growth and development. and development means both economic and social development and more inclusion. we do think the gender gap in involving women, in the economy in a way that their full potential can contribute to india’s economic growth is very important objective,” lipton added. pti","india ' reforms bearing fruit , make case steps : imf","washington , april 20 reforms carried india bearing fruit benefiting people , making strong case steps , top imf official said. implementation goods services tax ( gst ) , despite bumpy road , going help secure solidity foundation public finances , david lipton , international monetary fund ( imf ) ’ first deputy managing director david lipton , told pti. recent steps taken deal accumulated problems banks important ones , lipton said , identified digital id technology structural reforms important moves towards inclusive growth making india economic powerhouse. “there ’ certainly done india seeing benefits done , ” said sidelines spring meeting imf world bank. “india ’ reforms bearing fruit see growth performance.

2018-06-18,jaitley hints at no cut in excise on petrol; asks citizens to pay taxes,"new delhi, june 18 union minister arun jaitley on monday urged citizens to pay their due share of taxes “honestly” to reduce dependence on oil as a revenue source, and virtually ruled out any cut in excise duty on petrol and diesel saying it could prove counter-productive. while salaried class pays their due share of taxes, jaitley said “most other sections” have to improve their tax payment record, which is keeping india “far from being a tax-compliant society”. “my earnest appeal, therefore, to political leaders and opinion makers...would be that evasion in the non-oil tax category must be stopped and, if people pay their taxes honestly, the high dependence on oil products for taxation eventually comes down. in the medium and long run, upsetting the fiscal maths can prove counter-productive,” jaitley said. in a facebook post titled ‘the economy and the markets reward structural reforms and fiscal prudence’, jaitley said in last four years, the central government’s tax-gdp ratio had improved from 10 per cent to 11.5 per cent. almost half of this, 0.72 per cent of gdp, accounts for an increase in non-oil tax-gdp ratio. the level of non-oil taxes to gdp at 9.8 per cent in 2017-18 is the highest since 2007-08--a year in which our revenue position was boosted by buoyant international environment, he said. ; “this government has established a very strong reputation for fiscal prudence and macro-economically responsible behaviour. we know what happened during the taper tantrum of 2013. fiscal indiscipline can lead to borrowing more and obviously increase the cost of debt. “reliefs to consumers can only be given by a fiscally responsible and a financially sound central government, and the states which are earning extra due to abnormal increase in oil prices,” jaitley said. in an apparent dig at senior congress leader p chidambaram’s remark that tax on oil should be cut by rs 25 per litre, jaitley retorted “this is a ‘trap’ suggestion”. without naming chidambaram, jaitley noted that the “distinguished predecessor” had “never endeavoured to do so himself”. “it is intended to push india into an unmanageable debt--something which the upa government left as its legacy. we must remember that the economy and the markets reward structural reforms, fiscal prudence, and macro-economic stability. “they punish fiscal indiscipline and irresponsibility. the transformation from upa’s “policy paralysis” to the nda’s “fastest growing economy” conclusively demonstrates this. the government is aspiring to improve the tax-gdp ratio,” jaitley said. chidambaram had last week claimed that it was possible for the centre to cut tax by up to rs 25 per litre on petrol prices but the modi government would not do so. as per government estimates, every rupee cut in excise duty on petrol and diesel will result in a revenue loss of about rs 13,000 crore. the price of indian basket of crude surged from usd 66 a barrel in april to around usd 74 currently. jaitley said despite higher compliances in new system, as far as the non-oil taxes are concerned, india is still far from being a tax-complaint society. “salaried employees is one category of tax-compliant assessees. most other sections still have to improve their track record. the effort for next few years has to be to replicate the last four years and improve india’s tax to gdp ratio by another 1.5 per cent. “the increase must come from the non-oil segment since there is scope for improvement,” he said. these additions, jaitley said, had to come by more and more people performing their patriotic duty of paying the non-oil taxes to the state. “the tragedy of the honest taxpayer is that he not only pays his own share of taxes but also has to compensate for the evader,” he said. jaitley said the central government collected taxes in the form of income tax, its own share of gst and the customs duty. around 42 per cent of the central government taxes are shared with the states. state governments collect their 50 per cent from gst besides their local taxes. these are independent of taxes on petroleum products. the states charge ad valorem taxes on oil. if oil prices go up, states earn more, he said. pti",jaitley hints cut excise petrol ;

tenure remaining, and return to the us for “very compelling reasons”—the second high-profile exit from the government in less than a year. he said he would leave the office within the next two months, even though his contractual term was co-terminus with the government. subramanian was appointed cea, finance ministry, on october 16, 2014, for a three-year term and was given an extension last year. “my departure from this job for entirely personal reasons. it is no secret that we are expecting our first grandchild in the early september. that’s a very compelling reason that takes us back to old life of that used to lead of researching, writing, teaching and reflecting above all,” he said. subramanian’s official contract was till may 2019. ; “the first person i mentioned this to was the prime minister after consulting mr (arun) jaitley,” he said, while expressing that this was the best job he ever had and probably ever will. earlier in the day, union minister arun jaitley announced that subramanian will be leaving the finance ministry after nearly 4 years because of “pressing family commitments” and return to the us. asked about his last date in the office, he said, “in terms of date, the hard deadline is early september, when the baby is going to arrive. we haven’t exactly finalised. it would be over the next month or two. no firm date as yet has been fixed.” to a question on his future plans, he said, it will be revealed in the next few days. “you will get to know what i am exactly, i will be going do, in the next few days. i can not reveal that right now for obvious reasons. whatever has to be done has to done through formal channel but in few days you will get to know what i will be doing in the next year at least,” he said. “i am profoundly grateful and humbled by these extraordinarily generous words by minister arun jaitley announcing my decision to return-for personal reasons-to researching and writing. cea job most rewarding, fulfilling, exciting i have

august 2017, nearly two-year before his term was to end. incidentally, both were handpicked after the bjp government came to power in may 2014 and cited personal reasons for quitting the job ahead of tenure. when asked about his successor, he said the process would start soon and “competence, competence, competence, that’s what the government believes in and that’s what the government should follow” while choosing his successor. on the unfinished agenda, he said, he would like to see office of cea in every state. “one thing which i wish we could have done... there was a lot of demand for creating the office of cea in a number of states, a number of chief ministers were keen to have something like this and i wish i had more bandwidth, time and energy to kind of do this in the states as well. i hope it will happen going forward,” he said. on the recent talks of india aiming at touching double digit growth rate, he said it should certainly aspire for this. subramanian said: “it helps on so many fronts. to achieve double digit growth, you need two things, you need favourable external environment, which is not the case and you need to do a lot of domestic policy hard work at home. “i think government has begun to do the later but i think economic environment has deteriorated. so may be task become that more challenging. i would never say double digit growth is beyond the reach of india. we can but you would need both need external environment and ongoing sustained policy reform at home.” on global trade wars and growing protectionism, the cea said: “i do think we need to think about what measures we need to take to cushion any adverse fallout. i think trade war will not happen internationally but if it does, we have to find appropriate responses in terms of domestic polices as well.” when asked if he would be willing to take up assignment in the future in india, he said, he always committed to serving the country. on the goods and services tax, he said many of the exempted sectors should come under this as broader the base of gst better it is. it is for the gst council to take a call, he added. on his proposal of setting up a bad bank two-and-a-half years ago to deal with bad loans, he said: “i was very passionate about that but the nclt process offers a legal framework for resolving this bad bank might not have been able to do. i am very happy in this instance that an alternative idea gained traction and resolution process is moving well.” with regard to the universal basic income proposed by him in the economic survey of 2016-17, he said, it didn’t happen but it became a part of the policy discussion. “the idea has been around. we just brought it in the more prominence. all policies will have to navigate through challenging times,” he

“so, when our friends in congress say that they will have just one gst rate, they are effectively saying they will tax food items and commodities, which are currently at zero or 5 per cent, at 18 per cent,” he said in an interview to ‘swarajya’ magazine. ; modi, according to a part-transcript of the 45-minute interview posted by swarajya on its website, said against a total of 66 lakh indirect taxpayers registered since independence, 48 lakh new enterprises have registered since the launch of the gst on july 1, 2017. “around 350 crore invoices were processed and 11 crore returns were filed. would we be looking at such numbers, if gst were indeed very complex?” he asked. “check-posts across the country have been abolished and there are no more queues at state borders. not only are truck drivers saving precious time but also the logistics sector is getting a boost and thereby increasing the productivity of our country. would this be happening if gst was complex?” to a query on criticism of gst implementation, he said the new tax regime was a massive change, requiring a complete reset of one of the world’s largest economic systems. “the reform merged 17 taxes, 23 cesses into one single tax. when it was finally introduced, it was our endeavour to make it simple and ensure sensitivity of the system. there are often teething troubles seen when a reform of this magnitude is carried out, but these issues were not only identified but also addressed in real time,” he said. the gst, he said, has seen indian cooperative federalism at its best. “we consolidated the states and developed proactively a consensus, where earlier governments had failed.” the prime minister said earlier many taxes were hidden and under the gst, “what you see is what you pay.” “the government has reduced taxes on nearly 400 groups of items. around 150 groups of items have zero per cent tax rate. if you look at the rates, for most of the day-to-day commodities, the rate has actually come down. be it rice, wheat, sugar, spices, etc, total tax levied has been reduced in most cases. large number of items of daily usage are either exempted or in 5 per cent slab. some 95 per cent items fall in/below the 18 per cent slab,” he said. the gst, he said, has been designed to eliminate inspector raj with the help of information technology. from returns to refund, everything happens online, the pm said. pti",mercedes milk cannot taxed rate : pm modi,"new delhi , july 1 prime minister narendra modi sunday ruled single tax rate gst , saying mercedes car milk cannot taxed rate accepting congress party ’ demand uniform 18 per cent rate would lead spike food essential items ’ taxation. modi said goods services tax ( gst ) within one year launch led 70 per cent jump indirect taxpayer base , demolished check-posts merged 17 taxes 23 cesses one single tax. new tax regime , subsumed central levies like excise duty service tax state taxes like vat , aimed making indirect taxation “simple ” eliminating inspector raj , said , adding gst evolving system calibrated based feedback state governments , trades stakeholders. “it would simple one slab would meant could food items zero per cent tax rate. milk mercedes rate ?

2018-07-04,cabinet approves steep rs 200 per quintal hike in msp for paddy,"vibha sharma  new delhi, july 4 the government on wednesday hiked the minimum support price for paddy by a steep rs 200 per quintal as it looked to keep its poll promise to give farmers 50 per cent more rate than their cost of production. the decision, taken by the union cabinet headed by prime minister narendra modi, comes less than a year before the next general election. while the bjp had promised in 2014 to give farmers a price of 1.5 times of cost, an announcement to give effect to the promise was made in the government’s fifth and final annual budget presented on february 1 this year. the cabinet committee on economic affairs (ccea) at its meeting on wednesday approved the msp of 14 kharif (summer-sown) crops. according to sources, the msp of paddy (common grade) has been increased by rs 200 to rs 1,750 per quintal, while that of grade a variety by rs 160 per quintal to rs 1,750. ; the msp of paddy (common) was rs 1,550 per quintal and rs 1,590 per quintal for paddy (grade a) variety. the msp of cotton (medium staple) has been increased to rs 5,150 from rs 4,020 and that of cotton (long staple) to rs 5,450 from 4,320 per quintal. in pulses, tur msp has been raised to rs 5,675 per quintal from rs 5,450, and that of moong to rs 6,975 per quintal from rs 5,575. urad msp has been hiked to rs 5,600 from rs 5,400 per quintal. hike in paddy msp will increase the food subsidy bill by over rs 11,000 crore based on procurement figure of the 2016-17 marketing year (october-september). the food corporation of india (fci), the government’s nodal agency for procurement and distribution of foodgrains, buys wheat and rice from farmers at msp and supplies the grains under the food security law. paddy is the main kharif (summer sown) crop, the sowing of which has already begun with the onset of southwest monsoon. earlier, sources had said that the msp rate proposed by the agriculture ministry is higher than the government’s farm advisory body cacp, considering growing farm distress because of fall in prices of most crops, owing to bumper production. india is estimated to have harvested a record foodgrains production at 279.51 million tonnes in the 2017-18 crop year (july-june) on all-time high output of rice, wheat, coarse cereals and pulses. the announcement of higher msp coupled with forecast of normal monsoon this year could further boost foodgrains output. however, the higher support price could also fuel food inflation. the revision is estimated to cost the central government rs 15,000 crore. union minister rajnath singh, who made the announcements on wednesday, said his government would ensure the revisions would not affect inflation. “there are many factors that lead to rate of inflation. i want to assure people on behalf of the government that this will not affect the inflation rates in any way,” singh said. “it is a well considered decision. all input costs have been taken into consideration while fixing the msp.” the revision in minimum support prices comes at a time when aggravating agrarian distress is forcing farmers to plan protest marches across the country. india is estimated to have harvested a record foodgrains production at 279.51 million tonnes in 2017-18 crop year (july-june), on all-time high output of rice, wheat, coarse cereals and pulses. however, agriculture experts point out that higher msps alone would not bring relief to india’s distressed farming sector, because penetration of msp benefits are limited to some states. for example, eastern states remain largely remained untouched by the benefits of msp, while states like punjab, haryana, western uttar pradesh, parts of gujarat, maharashtra and southern states are major beneficiaries. besides, several small and marginal farmers are not aware of these benefits. unimpressed farmers’ representatives said the revision was less than they asked for. bhartiya kisan union national general secretary yudhvir singh and bku-rajewal president balbir singh rajewal said input costs were much higher than factored by the cacp and the bjp-led government. “the government has not fulfilled our expectations. when the basis of cacp calculations is not correct so how can proper msp be calculated? unless the cacp method of msp calculation is revised, the farmers cannot hope to make any gains. what the government has given today is not c2 plus 50 as it is claiming but a2 plus afl. even with the current calculation methodology adopted by the cacp, the paddy msp should be at least rs 2200 a quintal. also where is the assurance of procurement? unless there is proper agriculture policy backed by 100 per cent procurement assurance there can be no relief, ” said yudhvir singh, outlining the agitation by his organisation from haridwar on september 23 to rajghar in delhi on october 2 on issues related to msp and loan waiver. in agriculture terms, ‘a2’ covers actual paid out expenses, both cash and kind, and includes cost on seeds, fertilisers, hired labour, machines, insecticides, pesticides, irrigation costs, etc. ‘a2+fl’ is the actual paid-out expenses plus imputed value of family labour. ‘c2’ includes a2+fl, plus rentals as well as interest on owned land and fixed assets. “the c2 formula makes the cost of production higher than what the commission for agricultural costs and prices bases its recommendations,” agriculture expert sudhir panwar said. rajewal said additional input costs like gst on fertilisers and machines and diesel prices should take msp on paddy to at least rs 3,200 per quintal. experts said higher msp alone could not bring relief to distressed segment as msp penetration was limited to some states. “eastern states have largely remained untouched of its benefits unlike punjab, haryana, western uttar pradesh and parts of gujarat, maharashtra and southern states. small and marginal farmers are not even aware of its benefits. the ‘historic’ hike only signifies how the modi government suppressed msp to contain inflation in the past four years. “the much hyped msp increase for coarse grains and pulses is of little use for farmers unless supplemented with robust procurement system like paddy and that too in selected states. therefore, hike in coarse cereals, pulses and oilseed is of notional value. moreover, to make msp functional centre should announce state wise procurement target on the basis of production estimates of kharif crops,” panwar said. however, officials said the agriculture ministry proposed higher rate than advisory body cacp’s recommendation to cover up losses due to a fall in prices of crops following bumper production.. this year will see three crucial elections—madhya pradesh, rajasthan and chhattisgarh. with pti",cabinet approves steep rs 200 per quintal hike msp paddy,"vibha sharma new delhi , july 4 government wednesday hiked minimum support

2018-07-05,decoding msp by modi govt: why farmers are not impressed,"vibha sharma  new delhi, july 5 ahead of key assembly and lok sabha elections, the bjp-led centre on wednesday announced a “historic” hike in the minimum support price (msp) for kharif (summer-sown) crops, including paddy, for the 2018-19 marketing season. unimpressed farmers’ representatives, however, claimed the rs 200 hike in the paddy msp was not sufficient to cover the real input costs or benefit the small and marginal farmers comprising the majority, as around 90 per cent are unable to sell crops at the assured price because of lack of procurement mechanism. swaraj abhiyan and jai kisan andolan termed the msp hike only a “small victory” for farmers in the election year. the narendra modi government has been forced to partially act, at least on paper, on the promise of remunerative msp that it had made before the previous election. however, it was not the price promised by modi in hundreds of election meetings and contained in the 2014 election manifesto of the bjp, they contend. “any increase in support price of crops is welcome but let us remember what this msp announcement is not the price computed at 50% above comprehensive cost (c2) being demanded by farmer organisations,” they say. bhartiya kisan union national general secretary yudhvir singh and bku-rajewal president balbir singh rajewal also reiterated the same that input costs are much higher than factored by the cacp and the government while calculating the support prices announced on wednesday and that it was not as per the formula claimed, c2 plus 50. ; “the government has not fulfilled our expectations. when the basis of cacp calculations is not correct, how can proper msp be calculated? unless the cacp method of msp calculation is revised, the farmers cannot hope to make any gains. what the government has given today is not c2 plus 50 as it is claiming but a2 plus fl. “even with the current calculation methodology adopted by the cacp, the paddy msp should be at least rs 2,200 a quintal. also, where is the assurance of procurement? unless there is a proper agriculture policy backed by 100 per cent procurement assurance there can be no relief,” said yudhvir singh. the bku is planning an agitation from hardwar on september 23 to rajghat in delhi on october 2 on issues related to msp and loan waiver. other farmer organisations are also determined to carry on with their protests. so what are c2 plus 50 and a2 plus fl formulas? agriculture expert sudhir panwar explains that while the a2 plus fl formula takes into account actual cost plus imputed value of family labour in the production of a crop, the c2 formula factors in several other costs, including imputed rent on land and interest on capital, making the cost of production higher than what the commission for agricultural costs and prices (cacp) bases its recommendation. also, according to rajewal, with additional input costs like gst on fertilisers and machines and diesel prices, paddy msp should factor in these issues. experts say higher msp alone cannot bring relief to distressed segment as msp penetration was limited to some states. big farmers may gain but small and marginal ones, those with one or two acres of land, are unlikely to be any better off. “eastern states have largely remained untouched of its benefits unlike punjab, haryana, western uttar pradesh and parts of gujarat, maharashtra and southern states. small and marginal farmers are not even aware of its benefits. the ‘historic’ hike only signifies how the modi government suppressed msp to contain inflation in the past four years. “the much-hyped msp increase for coarse grains and pulses is of little use for farmers unless supplemented with robust procurement system like paddy and that too in selected states. therefore, hike in coarse cereals, pulses and oilseed is of notional value. moreover, to make msp functional the centre should announce state-wise procurement target on the basis of production estimates of kharif crops,” says panwar. as per officials, the agriculture ministry proposed higher rate than the advisory body cacp’s recommendation to cover up losses due to a fall in prices of crops following bumper production. however, according to swaraj abhiyan, what the government announced is not an immediate relief to farmers, it is merely a promise, the fulfillment of which depends on government procurement and intensive support. “without legal framework, msp is discretionary and farmers continue to be at the mercy of the whims of the next government,” they say. remember, elections are around the corner and while the bjp-led nda will have one more chance to woo farmers in the rabi (winter crops season) this is the last kharif announcement before the 2019 lok sabha polls/ avik saha of jai kisan andolan says that comparisons reveal “nothing historic or substantial about the msp hike. it is in fact lower than the hikes given by upa ii government in respect of almost all crops; for paddy, while the average hike provided by the upa ii was 69%, the modi government’s hike is only 41%. in 2008-09, which was also an election year, the upa government had announced a hike in msp for paddy common by 20.8%, which is much more that the hike of 12.9% now”. “yet, problems remained during the upa regime because no effort was made to ensure that farmers can sell their crop at msp. mere announcement brings nothing to the pocket of the farmer and if this government wants to seriously address the acute agrarian distress, it must immediately strengthen the market intervention and support schemes,” says jaivir singh, also from the jai kisan andolan. “even with the bjp ruling in many of the states, msp was not implemented in the last four years; so it is not clear how it will now suddenly be implemented. the opacity of intent of this government is worrisome and keeping in mind the track record of this government, one can at best be cautiously optimistic,” he adds ajit singh yadav alleges, “the msp was deliberately kept low for four years and is now being increased in the election year. therefore, this is nothing but an election gimmick. the real proof of effectiveness of the announcement will be tested from october onwards when crops will be harvested and will come to markets for sale. “this government had made a similar announcement for rabi crops but not a single farmer could sell all the produce at msp. agri-markets have become graveyards for farmers and this government has been a silent by-stander to the day-light robbery of farmers.” jai kisan andolan is a constituent member of all india kisan sangharsh coordination committee (aikscc), an apex body of 194 farmer organisations from across the country.",decoding msp modi govt : farmers impressed,"vibha sharma new delhi , july 5 ahead key assembly lok sabha elections , bjp-led centre wednesday announced “historic ” hike minimum support price ( msp ) kharif ( summer-sown ) crops , including paddy , 2018-19 marketing season. unimpressed farmers ’ representatives , however , claimed rs 200 hike paddy msp sufficient cover real input costs benefit small marginal farmers comprising majority , around 90 per cent unable sell crops assured price lack procurement mechanism. swaraj abhiyan jai kisan andolan termed msp hike “small victory ” farmers election year. narendra modi government forced partially act , least paper , promise remunerative msp made previous election. however , price promised modi hundreds election meetings contained 2014 election manifesto bjp , contend. “any increase support price crops welcome let us remember msp announcement price computed 50 % comprehensive cost ( c2 ) demanded farmer organisations , ” say. bhartiya kisan union national general secretary yudhvir singh bku-rajewal president balbir singh rajewal also reiterated input costs much higher factored cacp government calculating support prices announced wednesday per formula claimed , c2 plus 50. ;

2018-07-08,"trs, sp support simultaneous polls; dmk calls it unconstitutional","suresh dharur  hyderabad/chennai/new delhi, july 8 in an indication of the political realignment ahead of the general elections, the ruling telangana rashtra samithi (trs) in telangana has come out strongly in support of the nda government’s proposal to hold simultaneous polls to the lok sabha and state assemblies while its counterpart in andhra pradesh, the telugu desam party (tdp), has made an volte-face and opposed the idea. the telangana chief minister and trs founder president k chandrasekhar rao has sent a letter to the law commission chairman justice bs chauhan, pledging his support to the idea of synchronised polls to save resources and time and ensure unhindered focus on development. “we all know that four to six months of time is being spent in conducting elections each time to the lok sabha and the state legislatures. the entire administrative and security machinery get busy with the conduct of elections twice in a period of five years as per the current practice. the imposition of model code of conduct for such a long period is also hampering development and welfare activities being undertaken by the state government,” the chief minister said in his letter, which was handed over to justice chauhan by the party mp b vinod kumar in delhi on sunday. kcr, as the chief minister is known in the political circles, pointed out that large sums of public money was being spent on frequent elections in the country. “in the above backdrop, our party is strongly in favour of holding simultaneous elections to the lok sabha and the state legislative assemblies,” he said. the trs chief had in the past unequivocally backed demonetisation, goods and services tax (gst) and other policies of the nda government, triggering speculation about his party could gravitate towards the nda. the congress is the principal adversary of trs in telangana, while bjp is a marginal player. ; on the other hand, the ruling telugu desam party (tdp) in neighbouring andhra pradesh, which had recently ended alliance with the bjp and walked out of the nda over the special category status issue, has made a u-turn on the issue and opposed the idea of simultaneous polls, saying it was a “political ploy” of the saffron party to marginalise regional parties. “the simultaneous polls will weaken leaders of regional parties across the country. no national party is in a position to form government at the centre on its own and the support of regional parties has become mandatory. strengthening of regional parties has become a big obstacle for national parties,"" the senior tdp leader and finance minister y ramakrishnudu said. accusing prime minister narendra modi and bjp president amit shah of hatching “political conspiracies” to weaken the regional parties, he cautioned the people to be vigilant about such devious designs. the regional party had supported the idea of synchronous polls before parting ways with the bjp. in fact, the chandrababu naidu-led government had even suggested that polls to urban and rural local bodies should be conducted within one year of the elections to the lok sabha and assemblies. the law commission has prepared a draft paper titled 'simultaneous elections—constitutional and legal perspectives' and has sought opinions of all stakeholders including political parties, constitutional experts, bureaucrats and academia on the paper before finalising its report and sending it to the government. in its draft, the law panel has recommended amendments to the constitution and the representation of people's act, 1950, to facilitate simultaneous polls. sp support the proposition got a rather surprising up-vote—from akhilesh yadav’s samajwadi party. “in case public representatives switch sides or indulge in horse trading, action should be taken against them by the l-g within a week,” he said. general elections as well as state assembly elections of haryana, maharashtra and jammu & kashmir is due next year. ‘unconstitutional’ after the all india anna dravida munnetra kazagham, it was rival dravida munnetra kazagham’s turn to reject the proposal. dmk working president mk stalin said it his letter to the commission: “dmk are of the firm opinion that the proposed call for simultaneous elections to lok sabha and state legislatures goes against the basic tenets of our constitution."" the admk said it would consider supporting the proposal only after 2021, when tamil nadu will hold its next assembly elections. ‘managed democracy’ the aam aadmi party (aap) rejected the idea on sunday saying that it would turn india into a ""managed democracy"". aap leader ashish khetan, who appeared before the law commission to present his party's views, said after the meet: ""we are against the idea of the so-called one-nation-one-poll because it will turn india's federal democracy into a managed democracy."" he added that for simultaneous polls to lok sabha and state assemblies to happen, the constitution of india will have to be ""mutilated and rewritten completely"".

“india has three decades before it hits the point where the working-age population starts to decline. so that’s a long time. this is india’s window of opportunity in asia. it’s somewhat only a few other asian countries have this,” he said. “for the (next) three decades, it (india) is a source of growth for the global economy and could be even longer. but three decades where india can be almost what china was for the world economy for a while,” salgado said. in its report, the imf executive board has forecast india’s growth to rise to 7.3 per cent in fy2018/19 and 7.5 per cent in fy2019/20, on strengthening investment and robust private consumption. “the indian economy is recovering from the two shocks that started from late 2016: demonetisation and then the kind of implementation issues related to the gst. we see growth recovering. generally, india is benefiting from good macroeconomic policies; stability-oriented policies as well as some important reforms that have been done in recent years,” he said. although there are short-term issues, the imf views that as a long-term major gain for india by implementing a national gst. “it’s something that’s difficult to do. other countries have struggled. in india it’s much more complex because you have 29 states and union territories and you need agreement. i think that was a great achievement,” he said. insolvency and the bankruptcy code is the other big achievement, he said. “we are seeing certain positive steps there and we hope that can continue,” he said. “the third (big achievement) from an economist’s point of view is the inflation targeting framework that you now have in the reserve bank of india, formally adopted in 2016 but informally even earlier. we have seen the benefits of that have lower inflation and inflation expectations,” he said. and then there are some of the key smaller steps like things to improve the business climate, steps to further liberalise fdi. “in the near term, it’s just to make sure that effective implementation of those are ongoing. if you think of the insolvency and bankruptcy code, it’s a difficult change. basically, the underlying system to resolve bad assets from the corporate sector side is something new. it takes time and experience has to be gained. and we’re seeing some of the hitches along the way there, but generally things seem to be moving in the right direction,” the senior imf official said. noting that the government is taking steps to “streamline and simplify” the gst, he said the imf believed that this is important. “overall we’re seeing efforts to improve the balance sheet of banks as well as corporate sector. in our view, these are all important things that need to continue,” he said. salgado said that for india, things are relatively positive. “india has a young population. it has the potential for a demographic dividend of the next three decades,” he said but quickly cautioned that demographic dividend is not automatic. “it takes good policies to create jobs, to create even stronger economic growth. seven to eight per cent growth is very good. it’s one of the best in the world. but for india, which is appropriately aspiring to quickly catch up with the richer advanced countries, you need even stronger growth,” he said in response to a question. “so if you think about china, china had double-digit growth for many years and that’s how we quickly caught out and that’s something we should aspire to as well. because if that doesn’t occur, there is the risk that india could grow old before it becomes rich,” he said, noting that the imf is now suggesting india to take steps towards structural reforms. “the second message we are saying that steps to structural reforms have to continue and, in some ways, have to even take a step further up,” he said identifying labour reforms, improving the business climate, and enhancing infrastructure as key areas for continued reforms. and finally it is important to finish the cleanup of bank and corporate sector balance sheets, he said. pti ",strong indian economy continues lead global growth : imf,"washington , august 8 india source growth global economy next decades could china world economy , imf said wednesday , suggested country take steps towards structural reforms. “india contributes , purchasing power parity measures , 15 per cent growth global economy , substantial , ” ranil salgado , international monetary fund ’ mission chief india , told pti. next china us , said. salgado said spillovers india big open economy. “but total global growth purchasing power parity ( ppp ) terms , ’ 15 per cent total global growth. trading high china trade levels , ” salgado said imf executive board released report annual consultations india. said imf views india “long-run source global growth ” . ;

2018-08-09,imf forecasts india’s gdp to grow at 7.5 per cent in 2019-20,"new york, august 9 india is projected to clock an economic growth of 7.5 per cent in the 2019-2020 fiscal year on strengthening of investment and robust private consumption, the imf said in its latest report. the international monetary fund (imf), in the report published on tuesday, said the near-term macroeconomic outlook for india is “broadly favourable”. growth is forecast to rise to 7.3 per cent in fiscal year 2018/19 and 7.5 per cent in 2019/20 on strengthening investment and robust private consumption, the report said. headline inflation is projected to rise to 5.2 per cent in fiscal year 2018/19, as demand conditions tighten, along with the recent depreciation of the rupee and higher oil prices, housing rent allowances and agricultural minimum support prices, it said. the current account deficit is projected to widen further to 2.6 per cent of the gdp on rising oil prices and strong demand for imports, offset by a slight increase in remittances, the report said. it said financial sector reforms had been undertaken to address the twin balance sheet problems, as well as to revive bank credit and enhance the efficiency of credit provision by accelerating the cleanup of bank and corporate balance sheets. ; “stability-oriented macro-economic policies and progress on structural reforms continue to bear fruit” in the country, the report said. it said following disruptions related to the november 2016 currency exchange initiative and the july 2017 goods and services tax (gst) rollout, growth slowed to 6.7 per cent in fiscal year 2017/18, but a recovery is underway led by an investment pickup. headline inflation averaged 3.6 per cent in fiscal year 2017/18, a 17-year low, reflecting low food prices on a return to normal monsoon rainfall, agriculture sector reforms, subdued domestic demand and currency appreciation. the report recommended that continued fiscal consolidation is needed to lower elevated public debt levels, supported by simplifying and streamlining the gst structure. further, while important steps have been taken to improve the recognition of non-performing assets (npas) and recapitalise public sector banks (psbs), more needs to be done. “a recent large fraud at a psb highlights financial sector weaknesses and underscores the need for the government to take further steps to improve the psbs’ governance and operations, including by considering more aggressive disinvestment,” it said. with demand recovering and rising oil prices, medium-term headline inflation has risen to 4.9 per cent in may 2018, above the mid-point of the reserve bank of india (rbi)’s headline inflation target band of about 4 per cent. however, persistently-high household inflation expectations and large general government fiscal deficits and debt remain key macroeconomic challenges. “systemic macro-financial risks persist, as the weak credit cycle could impair growth and the sovereign-bank nexus has created vulnerabilities,” the report said. economic risks are tilted to the downside, the report said, adding that on the external side, risks include a further increase in international oil prices, tighter global financial conditions, a retreat from cross-border integration, including spillover risks from a global trade conflict, and rising regional geopolitical tensions. “domestic risks pertain to tax revenue shortfalls related to continued gst implementation issues and delays in addressing the twin balancesheet problems and other structural reforms,” it said. imf executive board directors welcomed the strong economic growth and commended the indian authorities for the important and wide-ranging reforms. while noting the broadly positive outlook, the directors observed that risks are tilted to the downside from external factors, such as higher global oil prices and tighter global financial conditions, as well as domestic financial vulnerabilities. against this background, they underscored the need for continued prudent macroeconomic policies and renewed emphasis on macro-financial and structural reforms. pti",imf forecasts india ’ gdp grow 7.5 per cent 2019-20,"new york , august 9 india projected clock economic growth 7.5 per cent 2019-2020 fiscal year strengthening investment robust private consumption , imf said latest report. international monetary fund ( imf ) , report published tuesday , said near-term macroeconomic outlook india “broadly favourable ” . growth forecast rise 7.3 per cent fiscal year 2018/19 7.5 per cent 2019/20 strengthening investment robust private consumption , report said. headline inflation projected rise 5.2 per cent fiscal year 2018/19 , demand conditions tighten , along recent depreciation rupee higher oil prices , housing rent allowances agricultural minimum support prices , said. current account deficit projected widen 2.6 per cent gdp rising oil prices strong demand imports , offset slight increase remittances , report said. said financial sector reforms undertaken address twin balance sheet problems , well revive bank credit enhance efficiency credit provision accelerating cleanup bank corporate balance sheets. ;

of violence from some states like madhya pradesh, maharashtra and gujarat and death of a child in bihar due to lack of access to an ambulance. the congress said the bandh had been successful and the united protest by the opposition parties had sent out a strong signal to prime minister narendra modi that people were now “going to teach him a lesson”. although the congress had given a clarion call to the entire opposition to join the bandh, bsp and sp leaders did not participate in the delhi agitation led by congress president rahul gandhi. the congress later dismissed the absence of sp and bsp

would unseat the bjp. launching a comprehensive attack on the bjp, manmohan singh also urged all opposition parties to sidestep their narrow differences and interests and unite to dislodge the bjp in the larger interest of democracy and unity. “time to dislodge the bjp is nearing. all opposition parties must rise above their small differences to defeat the bjp in the interest of national unity and democracy,” singh said, adding that the modi-led government had crossed all limits of “anti-people policies”. gandhi later took the attack on modi forward, saying: “the entire opposition is gathered here in a strong message to the pm. we promise you from here that together we will defeat the bjp (in 2019).” he accused the bjp of dividing india. “modi says nothing has happened in 70 years. indeed what he has done in four years has never happened in 70 years. wherever you see, one indian is fighting against the other. wherever you go, they divide people. one religion against another, one caste against another and one state against another,” he said. the congress later claimed the bandh was a success, saying the death of a two-year-old in bihar was not due to the bandh call. “the bihar administration has also clarified that,” congress media chief randeep surjewala said. on why sp and bsp were absent, surjewala said: “in fact four parties were absent: cpi, cpm, sp and bsp, as they wanted to hold their own protests which we welcomed. this issue is not an issue of political one upmanship. this is a people’s issue.” the congress is demanding reduction of excise duties on petrol and diesel and said the government had made rs11 lakh crore from 12 excise hikes on petrol and diesel in the last four years. “petrol should also be brought under gst,” surjewala said, attacking the bjp for saying “fuel price rise is beyond their control”. “if that’s the case, people will take control and teach this government a lesson soon. in any case, their countdown has begun,” he said. aap

2018-09-15,govt to stick to fiscal deficit target; mum on fuel tax cuts,"new delhi, september 15the government is determined to keep fiscal deficit at 3.3 per cent of gdp on the back of buoyant tax revenues and expectations of surpassing the disinvestment target, finance minister arun jaitley said saturday but remained non-committal on cutting tax on petrol and diesel. a day after steps to contain the widening current account deficit (cad) and check fall of the rupee were announced, prime minister narendra modi on saturday continued his two-day review of the economy as he took stock of tax collections and macro-economic indicators in analysing performance of different wings of the finance ministry. after the meeting, jaitley exuded confidence of surpassing the 7-7.5 per cent gdp growth target projected in the last budget presented on february 1, meeting capital expenditure targets, surpassing tax collections projections and exceeding the record rs 1 lakh crore target of revenue mobilisation from government stake sale in psus. he, however, did not say if the meeting discussed the recent spike in fuel prices that has led petrol touching a record high of rs 81.63 per litre and diesel to rs 73.54 a litre. there were expectations that the government may cut excise duty on the two fuels to ease burden on the consumers but it seems it didn't want to take chance as it stands to lose rs 14,000 crore in revenue from a re 1 per litre cut in excise. ; it feels that the country cannot afford to have a twin deficit problem-a depreciating rupee and high crude import bill putting pressure on the country's current account deficit (cad), and a fiscal slippage. ""the government is confident and will strictly maintain the 3.3 per cent fiscal deficit target,"" jaitley told reporters after the over three-hour long meeting. with 44 per cent of the budgeted capital expenditure estimate for the current fiscal year ending march 31, 2019 already spent by august 31, the government ""will end the year without any cut,"" he said, adding that it was extremely necessary to maintain 100 per cent capital expenditure for high growth rate. ""the government is confident that we will have a growth rate higher than what we had projected earlier this year in the budget,"" he said. ""the inflation is broadly under control"". on revenue collections, he said the impact of anti-black money measures, demonetisation and gst are now visible with ""phenomenal"" increase in tax base. ""the cbdt is very clear that this year they will be able to collect in excess of budgeted target,"" he said. on indirect tax side, he said the goods and services tax (gst) is settling down and a pick up in consumption will boost collections in coming months. ""we are confident that between direct and indirect tax collections, the government will comfortably meet the target if not surpass it,"" he said, adding the rs 1 lakh crore disinvestment target will be surpassed. ""and on basis of all these analyses, we are optimistic about our growth rate, our tax collection and certainly as far as fiscal deficit is concerned will strictly meet the 3.3 per cent target,"" he said. asked if fuel prices and duty cuts were discussed, he said the meeting today was internal review meeting. almost half of the retail selling price of petrol and diesel is made up of central and state taxes. the centre currently levies a total of rs 19.48 per litre of excise duty on petrol and rs 15.33 per litre on diesel. on top of this, states levy value added tax (vat). ""the primary focus of yesterday's discussions was with regard to current account deficit and how to narrow it down and possible steps with that regard. today of course was an internal meeting in which the prime minister took the review of various departments of finance,"" jaitley said. after yesterday's review meeting, the government announced easing in overseas borrowing norms for manufacturing companies; removed restrictions on foreign portfolio investors (fpi) investment in corporate bonds and provided tax benefits on masala bonds. at saturday's meeting detailed presentations were made by departments of economic affairs, revenue, expenditure and disinvestment. ""after those detailed presentations, prime minister expressed his satisfaction with regard to the broad parameters in relation to economy and macroeconomic data which is so far emerging this year.
