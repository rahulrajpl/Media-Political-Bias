2014-12-01,rafale deal on agenda as parrikar meets french counterpart today,"ajay banerjee  new delhi, november 30 when indian defence minister manohar parrikar meets his french counterpart jean-yves le drian tomorrow, he faces a harsh reality; almost 40 per cent of the indian air force fighter jet fleet is on its ‘last legs’ and needs an immediate replacement. a decision to buy jets from france is pending since january 2012, stuck in ‘modalities’ of transfer of technology. the ministry of defence (mod) selected french company dassualt aviation’s rafale jets out of six-global bidders in january 2012 to meet its need of 126 medium multi-role combat aircraft (mmrca). the visiting french defence minister will raise the issue to conclude the deal during his two-day visit to new delhi tomorrow. ; parrikar and his team of officials, expectedly, will be looking to provide the iaf with the necessary firepower to deal with any eventuality in view of the unfriendly neighborhood. parrikar, who joined as defence minister on november 10, will have to balance the ‘make in india’ mantra with the reality of international arms deals. the mod is yet to accept the terms proposed by dassault. the draft contract is 90 per cent complete. the first 18 jets are to be imported and the rest manufactured under licence by hindustan aeronautics limited (hal). in january 2012, four sub committees were formed to study the contract. its complexities are huge like transfer of technology, pricing, work share between dassualt and hal. sources said dassault was reluctant to accept responsibility for the 108 fighters to be built by hal as far as liquidity damages and timelines for production are concerned. this is the main issue stalling the deal as the french company has made it clear that it could logically not guarantee what hal produces. in fact, the last 60 planes are slated to have 90 per cent indian content. the french company wants clauses on access, inspection and post-manufacture testing and has also asked hal to clarify the specifics of similar liability clauses in other such comparable deals like hal's sukhoi-30 mki licence production deal with russia. on october 4, iaf chief air chief marshal arup raha sounded an alarm saying most of the fleet of fighter jets was “on its last legs”. the ongoing acquisition programmes to replace these aging jets with new ones are running years behind schedule while the ongoing mid-life upgrade of existing fleets of mig 29, jaguar and the mirage 2000 has slowed down. “there is a delay in each and every project (for fighter jets)… we have lost timelines, overruns are much more than they should have been. it is definitely a matter of concern”, the iaf chief has warned. at present, india has 34 fighter jet squadrons (16-18 planes in each) against the projected need of 45 squadrons. without rafale, the iaf will have to continue to fly its fleet of mig 21s and mig 27s for longer periods. even if india inks the contact now, it would take three-four years for the first squadron of rafale to arrive and another seven-eight years for the balance of the aircraft.

however, the iaf, which has ordered a court of inquiry on the crash, denied that any final conclusion has been arrived at. noting that the incident relates to “inadvertent firing” of ejection seat of the plane, air force chief arup raha said india has had similar incidents or accidents in the past. “in this case, we have done a thorough investigation but it is not yet complete. a final report is yet to come. but, we did not really find anything wrong with the system. “and it does not, of course, indicate that there is a human error or a pilot error,” he said. raha underlined that there had been instances when such inadvertent firing had taken place. “that goes to show there is something wrong since we did not find anything wrong in system per se, mechanical part, servicing part as well as electrical part of the ejection system. “the coi is yet to find an exact reason. we are yet to decide how to pinpoint exactly,” he said. asked if the iaf has ruled out deliberate ejection, he said it has. “we have not been able to find any fault with the system as of now. but this thing has happened. we have historical evidence of the seat having malfunctioned in the past. “so that is a good ground to say that there has been something wrong,” he told reporters here. sukhoi cannot replace rafale: iaf chief indian air force chief arup raha today ruled out buying of more russian su-30s in place of french rafale jets saying the two aircraft complement each other but do not replace the other. amid doubts creeping in that talks with rafale would breakdown, raha said that his force has no plan b and was working on only plan a. highlighting that his force has a number of legacy aircraft and their replacements are necessary, raha said the medium multi-role combat aircraft (mmrca) deal, for which rafale has been shortlisted, needs to be inked in the “quickest possible time because drawdown is true”. defence sources had said that india could buy more sukhoi 40s in case the rafale deal does not happen. however, raha said, “mmrca and sukhoi-30, the requirements are slightly different. and they have their own capabilities. they complement each other but do not replace each other.” he said that everyone is aware of the drawdown of the combat squadrons of the iaf and stressed that every air force faces obsolescence in its cycle of operations. “it is not new or specific to indian air force,” raha said addressing journalists here at the aero india. he said legacy aircraft of the force like mig-21 and mig-27 need to be replaced so that the force can have the required 42 squadrons of combat planes. asked about the rafale fighter jet, he said he would prefer to call it mmrca. “rafale has been selected as l1 (lowest bidder). it is a replacement. it is important that we have the mmrca and we need to have it in the quickest possible time because drawdown is true,” raha said. he said mmrca could fill up the gap in the air force, adding that if the deal is inked today, the first squadron will only come in three years and subsequent ones in 5-6 years. he said the contract negotiating committee is working out the issues in the deal and hoped it would be inked. asked if the force has a plan b in case the deal does not happen, raha said, “no, we don’t have a plan b as of now. we are only working on plan a”. rafale was shortlisted in 2012 by the ministry of defence but a final contract is yet to be signed. as per the rfp (request for proposal) issued in 2007, the first 18 jets are to be imported and the rest 108 manufactured under licence by hindustan aeronautics ltd (hal). — pti ","russia blames ‘human factor ’ , iaf denies","bengaluru , february 19 russia today blamed “human factor ” crash sukhoi-30 mki fighter aircraft october last year led grounding entire fleet india ’ frontline fighter plane month , charge denied indian air force. “our stand human factor , ” said vitaly borodich , vice presdient ( military sales ) irkut corporation. irkut subsidiary russia ’ state-run united aircraft corporation umbrella organisation country ’ aerospace industry. borodich claimed iaf also accepted “human factor ” . “they ( iaf ) accept , therefore , aircraft operation , ” said , briefing group journalists sidelines aero india air show here. ;

2015-03-11,rafale deal continues to face turbulence,"new delhi, march 11 india’s multi-billion dollar rafale fighter jet contract with france continues to be stuck in the doldrums even as the two countries have agreed to “fast-track” the negotiations. but while forward movement is awaited in this regard, defence sources made it clear that the upcoming visit of prime minister narendra modi to france and the fighter jet deal were two separate issues which cannot be linked. “there are some issues which still persist because of which the final contract is pending for such a long time,” defence sources here said when asked if the issues relating to pricing and the guarantee clause had been sorted out. talking about chances that the deal would be worked out ahead of modi’s visit to france next month, the sources maintained the two were not linked. “the rafale deal is not linked to the official visit of the prime minister. these are two separate things. an official visit is not only about signing defence deals,” the sources said. ; they made it clear that the makers of rafale—dassault aviation—will have to stand by the clauses of the request for proposal (rfp) to which they had agreed. asked if that meant that the ball was in the french court as far as the rafale deal was concerned, the sources said one could say so. meanwhile, talking about the likely options in case the rafale deal were to fall through, the sources said that indian defence procurement rules do not permit any lateral entry and a fresh tender was the only solution if the contract does not get signed. the sources, however, refused to give a timeline for a final decision. they also insisted that the rafale deal and the joint development project with russia for a fifth generation fighter aircraft (fgfa) are two different things. “there is no link between the two. we want to speed up the process on the fgfa front, but that has got nothing to do with the rafale deal,” the sources said. the french rafale and the eurofighter typhoon were the only ones left standing after years of tests on technical and other aspects vis-a-vis the move to acquire medium multi-role combat aircraft. “rafale was selected in 2012 since it was the lowest bidder. the difference in cost with the second bidder was razor thin. with cost now more than double, how can it be the lowest bidder,” defence sources had said in january while explaining why the negotiations for finalising the contract were taking so much time. another point of contention is the guarantee clause under which rafale has to stand guarantee for the planes that would be manufactured by state-owned hal. as per the rfp issued in 2007 for the 126 jets, the first 18 are to be imported while the remaining ones are to be manufactured under licence by hindustan aeronautics ltd (hal). in february, dassault aviation ceo eric trappier said the pricing remains the same from day one and it has not wavered from the rpf. however, defence sources insist it is otherwise. french defence minister jean-yves le drian had last month held talks here with his indian counterpart manohar parrikar to salvage the contract. the visit by the french minister had come just two months after he and parrikar met and decided to “fast-track” the contract negotiations for the nearly usd 10-billion deal for the rafale fighter jets. — pti ",rafale deal continues face turbulence,"new delhi , march 11 india ’ multi-billion dollar rafale fighter jet contract france continues stuck doldrums even two countries agreed “fast-track ” negotiations. forward movement awaited regard , defence sources made clear upcoming visit prime minister narendra modi france fighter jet deal two separate issues cannot linked. “there issues still persist final contract pending long time , ” defence sources said asked issues relating pricing guarantee clause sorted out. talking chances deal would worked ahead modi ’ visit france next month , sources maintained two linked. “the rafale deal linked official visit prime minister. two separate things. official visit signing defence deals , ” sources said. ;

the minister is flying down on may 5 from qatar to firm up the modalities as india wants the fighter aircraft as soon as possible. “this visit will focus on firming up the broad parameters for the deal under which the contract would eventually be inked,” the sources said. french sources said they “are open to any idea” but insisted that nothing has been fixed as yet. “we will have to see how the meeting will go and then get a feedback to actually decide what can be done. we are open to all ideas. something will have to be done,” they said when asked about the plans for a joint venture. the production rate of dassault aviation for rafale stands at about 1 aircraft per month. however, the company has bagged three major contracts this year totalling to 84 aircraft, all of which have to be delivered fast. the latest contract to be won by dassault was from qatar for 24 rafale fighter jets and mbda missiles. last month, india and france had agreed to get into a government to government contract for 37 rafale jets in fly-away condition to be delivered keeping the critical requirement of the indian air force in mind. in february, egypt had become the first foreign buyer of rafale with a contract for 24 aircraft. also, the orders of the french navy are pending. while all the three deals are under government to government contract, contours of the agreement in case of deal with india are still unknown as this would be first such deal between france and india in defence. both in the case of egypt and qatar, government-to-government contract provides for an umbrella cover, whereas the actual contract is between the respective mod and dassault aviation. “this ensures necessary guarantee to the buying government from the french government with regard to price, delivery and quality. at the same time it allows flexibility to dassault aviation to have necessary commercial arrangements in place to meet the contractual obligations,” the sources said. it is expected that the indian defence ministry will also follow a similar model, something that the french would be keen for. parrikar had said all future negotiations for purchase of french rafale fighters would be through government to government route. he has also said further negotiation will decide if in. and if so, the number of it. under the original deal, 18 rafale jets were to be bought off the shelf while 108 were to be manufactured by state-run hindustan aeronautics limited (hal). the talks have been stuck over pricing and dassault’s refusal to stand guarantee for the jets to be manufactured by hal. the government has now decided to put aside the mmrca contract. the request for information for a medium multi-role combat aircraft was issued in 2001 and a request for proposal was issued in 2007. rafale was shortlisted in 2012. though the 36 rafale jets would be a shot in the arm for the iaf, it will not be enough for the dwindling air power of the force. even though the sanctioned strength of the iaf is 42 squadrons, it is currently equipped with only 35. adding to the trouble is the phasing out of the ageing mig 21s and mig 27s in the coming years. their draw-down is scheduled to start in 2017. the iaf has been banking on the rafale, the indigenously developed light combat aircraft ‘tejas’ and the fifth generation fighter aircraft deal with russia, but all the projects are running behind schedule. — pti ",rafale deal : dassault likely enter jv indian firm,"new delhi , may 3 multi-billion deal 36 rafale fighter jets could see french defence major dassault aviation entering joint venture state-run hal private player set base augmenting existing production line. defence sources said step , taken allow french firm ramp production rate help meet offset obligations india , likely 30-50 per cent sales value. considered first major push ‘make india ’ category defence sector , approach also mean french company would stand better chance case indian government decides go medium multi-role combat aircraft later initial 36 agreed. allow dassault aviation set manufacturing facilities india augment existing production line merignac france joint venture hal private player choice. operation sustainment perspective also , creating facilities help iaf , sources said. issues among others would discussed forthcoming visit french defence minister jean-yves le drian may 6 indian counterpart manohar parrikar national security advisor ajit doval , said. ;

i had to do a three months exercise to first crystalise it. i have done it now and i expect it to be out very soon. “but, he (rahul) is saying so casually that they had kept rs 500 crore. he does not know this issue at all,” he said, adding that it was the same case about other issues raised by him including the land bill. rahul had slammed the government for not implementing the orop. it has been a long-standing demand of the over two million ex-servicemen of india. it seeks to ensure that a uniform pension is paid to the defence personnel retiring in the same rank with the same length of service, irrespective of their date of retirement. the scheme is estimated to cost around rs 8,600 crore initially and subsequently several crore rupees annually. currently, all pre-2006 (the year the 6th pay panel recommendations became effective) pensioners receive lesser pension than not only their counterparts but also their juniors. parrikar also attacked the congress on the controversial land bill and accused the upa of “sez scam”. “if the bill that we brought does not become a law, it is the farmer who is going to get damaged the most,” he said, adding land is required for all projects, including those for power, water supply and roads. noting that all children of a farmer cannot go into farming because the land will get fragmented, parrikar said agriculture needs to co-exist with industrilisation. “when we became independent, our country’s population was about 35 crore, if i am not mistaken, of which around 20 crore were farmers. we say that 70 per cent was agriculture,” he said, adding today farmers constitute some 25 per cent of the population. “but in real numbers, out of 125 crore, 25 per cent is 34 crore. at that time it was 20. so 14 crore people have increased,” he pointed out. “the land remains the same which means that the fragmentation of land is taking place. if more people go into agriculture, fragmentation will be more and a fragmented land holding cannot be economically viable,” he said. the former goa chief minister underlined that he considers farmers to be big since they are creators and that is why he respects them. parrikar alleged the upa government brought its land bill “after their sez scam where private land was acquired at dirt cheap rate”. he claimed the upa brought in the legislation only to appease the public outcry against their sez policy. “these people (upa) brought that without proper thinking. “... under their government, lakhs of hectares of fertile land was acquired for sez projects which was a big fraud. it was forced on the country. even now, even 30 per cent of that land is not used. rest is with private operators,” parrikar said. — pti ",parrikar blames antony creating ‘stalemate ’ defence ministry,"new delhi , may 25 taking predecessor a. k. antony , defence minister manohar parrikar today said congress leader cannot “escape ” responsibility “stalemate ” created tenure. minister accused congress vice-president rahul gandhi raising important issues , including ‘one rank , one pension ’ ( orop ) without understanding it. combative parrikar , accused congress “compromising national security ” , said took brief spell arun jaitley defence minister start “moving wheels ” sector. however , said , assess damage caused due “stalemate ” . “he ( antony ) cannot escape responsibility assess level damage everyone style functioning , ” parrikar told pti interview. ; “what inherited stalemate. arunji tried started moving wheels. many issues , hardly time five months. started moving wheels. think started putting speed that. ” also wondered “anyone get away responsibility something gone well ” . parrikar said give excuse paucity time somebody questions completed unfinished tasks since ministry seven months. “after one year , still complain could complete many tasks. two years , complain still many pending , think right complain , ” said. last week , antony attacked parrikar compromising national security questioned high-profile rafale fighter jet deal prime minister narendra modi clinched french president francois hollande last month. minister also took rahul saying raising issues without understanding subjects. “these people ’ deep study , ” said , adding congress talking many things without knowing is. “yesterday , general secretary ( sic ) rahul talking orop. says kept rs 500 crore. sign tomorrow rs 500 crore , ” parrikar said. parrikar added question orop simple , would settled long time back. “why delay 10 years ?

2015-05-30,"'call for achhe din was to get rid of the bad, we have achieved that'","completing his first year in delhi, prime minister narendra modi speaks to raj chengappa, editor-in-chief of the tribune group of newspapers, on the challenges and successes he faced, and plans for the future. in his by now well-known quick-fire manner, the man from gujarat takes jibes at the previous government and its leadership, while keeping his campaign mode alive. read the full text. the late prime minister rajiv gandhi, who was the last person with a parliamentary majority before you, described people’s expectations of him as “scary”. at the end of one year, what is your impression of running the government? from the potential i have seen in the country, i believe there is no logic in it staying poor and underdeveloped. countries that attained freedom much later have developed more than us; we too could have been there. there is nothing lacking in the country. i won’t go into where we went wrong or who did wrong. when i spoke of swachh bharat on august 15 last year, i knew i was taking a risk, but i was amazed at the response that i received, it was beyond my imagination. even the media that is usually critical of the government (which is natural and how it should be) has been furthering this particular campaign. such has been the awareness created today that children point out to their parents if they litter. i must admit even though i am pained to see filth, i was not confident if i would be able to create a culture of cleanliness, but people have caught on. they are not going to have any personal gains from this, yet they are working for it. this has shown the real strength of the country. then i have seen the strength of the government machinery. when i declared we’ll open bank accounts before january 26, everyone was shocked: this is something that has never happened in 60 years, what is this man saying! but within around 100 days, before december 25, the targets were nearly met by all. the government machinery and bank employees went to people’s homes. this shows if given clear guidance and road map are given, government employees have the ability to deliver results. what has been your main thrust in the first year, what did you want to do? the country had seen such ‘burre din’, everything was at a standstill, so the foremost question on my mind was where do i begin? i was new for delhi, delhi was new for me, i had also not had much interaction with delhi or its bureaucracy. so to shed light to see how things were, i started with small trials to see if the system’s frequency matched mine or not. and within three i months i found it matched perfectly. that gave me a huge confidence. for instance a concept like being punctual to work; we didn’t take out a circular, i just started arriving on time myself and soon i saw people all around had started doing that. so far no one has faced action for being late; i take a sympathetic view of the matter, a person could be late because of some family issue, he can’t be sacked for that. so i combine self-discipline in personal life with a humane approach to others. in all of this, my 13 years’ experience has been of tremendous use. ; what is the difference you find between running a state, as you did in gujarat, and running a nation? fundamentally there is no difference. ultimately, you have to run the administration, do human resource management. but at the centre there are certain new domains, such as defence or foreign affairs. one issue is that in states you have an organic team, but at the centre it is an assembled team that has come in from states for two or three years. so to run the government in delhi, one has to set up a team that is homogenous and has members who will spend 30-35 years here, a team that will be able to function here. people keep taunting you with the question where are the ‘achhe din’? what exactly do you mean by achhe din and have you delivered? when visiting an ailing person, we say don’t worry, he’ll be well [“achha ho jayega”]. the word ‘achha’ [good] here is in the context of the ‘burra’ [bad] that the patient is going through. so my idea of ‘achhe din’ is riddance of that bad. and i believe we have achieved this. our opponents started with making fun of the idea, asking every time a train would be late if it were achhe din. it would have been good if these people had asked the congress ‘gareebi hatao’ has been your slogan since 1970, has it happened? they had a strength of 415 in parliament, four people of one family have run the country, what did they achieve? so my definition of achhe din is in the context of everyday life and the ‘bad days’ that prevailed — corruption, scams, policy paralysis, black money, coal, spectrum.... the country was fed up with all of this. and you have changed that in this one year? there is no question of such things now. what do you hear on coal auctions now? rs 3 lakh crore will come to the government’s coffers. how did you bring about this ‘cleaning up of corruption’? there has to be zero tolerance on this matter at the top. just my being honest is not enough. it should be visible in my speech, conduct, manner, policy, tradition, everything. i alone being ‘pure’ will not do. the way to achieve this is to lay down a policy on everything in black and white. the grey areas should be minimal, even if they can’t be zero. bureaucrats then have very little scope for discrimination; that in turn leaves no scope for corruption. are there going to be more measures to block corruption like this? i’ll give you instances: the government used to buy led bulbs at rs 348, now it is rs 80. a cement sack was procured at rs 360, now it is rs 150 — though my figures may not be exact. what about bringing back the black money that was promised? first of all, none of those who have been in power thus far have any right to question my government on black money. all this black money was generated because they took no measures to check it. despite directions from the supreme court, they did not constitute an sit for three years. this means people holding black money were given that period to cover their trails. had they acted the day the court gave the orders, the country would have gained billions of rupees. the first decision of our first cabinet meeting was to create an sit, which is given all information, and it passes it on to the supreme court in sealed covers. yes, we don’t inform the media because there are international legal issues involved. to get black money back from abroad we need cooperation of countries around the world. at the g20 summit, i ensured an entry regarding cooperation on black money in the final resolution. so can we expect all people hoarding black money will be caught and their names revealed? names we can give only to the supreme court because we are bound by law, but we are going to spare no one. i would ask the tribune as well to give us any information it may have on black money. has anyone dared to create a law as tough as we have on this? despite your efforts against corruption the opposition calls you are a ‘suit-boot ki sarkar’, you favour corporates. i want to request a group of senior journalists to compile a list of all the criticism that has been there against my government. someone finds meanings for the acronym m.o.d.i., some say nda is mnda, some call us arrogant, others discuss a suit or a boot, or coat or hair. just look at their bankruptcy, they are not being able to identify a single concrete issue. this is the greatest achievement of this government. an issue that concerns punjab and haryana particularly is farmer distress. the charge is that the centre did not move quickly enough when unseasonal rain damaged farmers’ crops and they were committing suicide. also why did you not visit the affected people? let us look at the record. as chief minister of gujarat — which was struck by calamities every other year — i had got tired of submitting memorandums to the central government, but they did not so much as glance at us. this year after the hail damage, chief ministers in all bjp-ruled states immediately visited farmers, officials were sent out to survey the damage. there had been a long-standing policy that compensation would be paid to farmers only if the damage was more than 50 per cent. we brought that down to 33 per cent. the compensation was increased by 50 per cent. earlier, damaged grain was not procured by government agencies. this time we decided to procure all grain, and that too without any cut in the msp. these were decisions for which farmers had been crying for years. as for my visiting farms, tell me if a congress leader has visited a farm in the past 10 years. were there no farming calamities? as chief minister i used to regularly visit farmers. my job now was to collect information, take decisions, mobilise the machinery. i did not go to nepal either, but did we not do work there? your party agreed with the land acquisition bill. now it is trying to amend it. why? people allege it is anti-farmer and pro-corporate. for 60 years they went with the old land acquisition laws. were they anti-farmer all this while? those who have forced 3 lakh farmers to commit suicide have no moral authority to complain now. the earlier law was 120 years old. for political interest they hurriedly brought in a law. in parliament they agreed orally to accept the changes suggested by the bjp, particularly regarding irrigation. but later on they removed those from the draft. after the nda came to power, we realised there were certain points in the law that would have made the farmers’ situation worse if we did not bring in the ordinance. also, chief ministers of several states ruled by various parties came to demand changes in the law, including kerala. we could not have made it a point of ego to say that we won’t change the law just because we supported it in 2013. our intention is to amend only those provisions in the 2013 act that militate against the process of growth and are against the interest of farmers. the reforms in this act will ensure greater irrigation potential, rural infrastructure, including electricity, schools and hospitals. the debate should be on merit. are you confident of getting the bill passed in parliament? this is not a matter of life or death for me. and neither was it the agenda of my party or the government. the initiative was in response to a demand from the states, and being a federal structure it was my duty to respond. so i am trying my level best. i am still prepared to accept any suggestions. do you plan a new deal for the farmers? the farmer is the backbone of our nation; 60 per cent of the population is engaged in farm-related activities. however, agriculture’s contribution to the gdp is only 15 per cent. we need to modernise agriculture to improve productivity and quality. we have introduced soil health cards which would help the farmer in reducing his cost and increase productivity. the prime minister’s krishi sinchai yojana will improve the irrigation potential. to provide banking facilities to farmers, we have successfully launched the jan dhan yojana, which provides overdraft facility also. what would you list as your major achievements in the past one year? i can say with pride that there has not been a single instance of corruption. our mission and commitment is towards the country’s progress. we have embarked on a path of transparency, efficiency and effectiveness in our policies. initiatives like the jan dhan yojana, swachh bharat abhiyan, soil health card and the recently launched social security schemes for the people at large are aimed at giving more income and security to the common man. on infrastructure, last year we awarded projects for the construction of more than 20 km of roads per day, and the construction has been achieved at a rate of more than 11 km per day. electricity generation has shown a growth of 9 per cent in 2014-15 over the previous year. emphasis on renewable energy is demonstration of the fact that we not only care about the present but also the future. the recent union budget gave a boost of rs 1 lakh crore to the infrastructure sector through public investment. pooling of gas for stalled power projects and fertiliser units shows our commitment to address the bottlenecks of the previous government. we have taken up the task of construction of toilets in every school. it is unfortunate that even after almost 68 years of independence our schools did not have functional toilets. our initiative of distribution of lpg and scholarships through direct bank transfers to beneficiary accounts is evidence of our intentions to focus on the poor and needy. new interventions on ganga rejuvenation, skill development, mobile and broadband connectivity for all villages, and ‘make in india’ is going to open new vistas of growth. this is just a beginning. on the economy, are you satisfied with the progress made so far with regard to inflation, jobs, growth in production, investment and exports? the 10-year period of the previous government was characterised by high prices and spiralling inflation. our efforts on both the demand and supply side have ensured that inflation is under check. it inflation is now well below 5 per cent. our efforts on economic front have been appreciated not only within the country but also by international organisations like imf, world bank and the oecd. as soon as we came to power we took proactive steps against hoarding, released additional food grains in the market and imported items that were in short in supply in the country. these steps have borne fruit and the inflation that was hovering around 10-12 per cent has now been moderated. in spite of inheriting an economy with huge problems we have been able to take corrective action that is visible from the fact that we have in the last year limited our fiscal deficit to 4 per cent as against our target of 4.1 per cent. foreign direct investment has risen by 39 per cent and foreign institutional investment (fii) has grown by 800 per cent. the foreign currency reserves are at an all-time high of us $35 billion. this also shows tremendous confidence of foreign investors in our economy. the gdp growth last year was 7.4 per cent. in the current year india’s gdp growth is expected to be the highest amongst all major economies of the world. we have taken more initiatives in this budget. mudra bank will help more than 6 crore small vendors and businesses, 61 per cent of who are sc, st, religious minorities or obc. we have also introduced the gst bill in parliament and are committed to its rollout from april 1, 2016. on ‘ease of doing business’, we have made substantial progress. these measures will mark a watershed in our growth story. we have made substantial progress in rationalising our procedures and forms. we are putting more and more approvals online. we have also relaxed fdi in various sectors, especially insurance. but people say you have been lucky with inflation, as oil prices went down substantially. when i say i am lucky, people attack me, they don’t like it! what is this? we have taken steps on inflation, but this is a volatile matter, and needs continued efforts. we’ll not leave it to luck. your call to “make-in-india” is significant. what has been the response? the response to the initiative has been very significant not only within india but outside as well. wherever i travelled in the past one year, i met senior executives of industry in that country and they all were very excited about our “make-in-india” plan. we have undertaken not only policy reforms but also focused on administrative reforms. we have laid emphasis on ease of doing business, making government more accountable, introducing technology in governance and reforms in all layers of government. we have essentially taken the reform process to an entirely different level where both the central and the state governments respond through a policy-based system and not by way of discretion or nepotism. similarly we are emphasising that the companies supplying defence equipment to us undertake to manufacture in india also. on defence, you went to france and made a bold decision to purchase 36 rafael fighter aircraft. people have questioned the rationale behind this step. a good government has to strike the right balance between different priorities. “make in india” is very important for me. so too is ensuring national security. i will not compromise on either. the purchase of rafale aircraft was guided by the need to respond to the immediate operational requirements of the air force which was affecting our defence capability. how can that be questioned? in fact, the challenge is to break a logjam that we inherited from the previous government. some decision had to be taken. we consulted all concerned and decided that we will have only a government-to-government deal. there will be transparency, so no one will be able to raise questions. there will be further discussions on this matter soon. i would mention that during my recent visit to france, the senior leadership of their defence industry showed great enthusiasm for participating in our “make in india” programme. do you think this way is going to be the future of defence procurement? that will be decided case to case. will you deliver on the one-rank-one-pension (orop) promise to the defence personnel? we are committed to orop, but we are in consultation with defence personnel regarding the definition of orop. our government is here for five years, and we cannot do anything without consulting the people concerned. the dialogue is being actively pursued. there is no need to have any doubt on this. the tribune has a large readership among defence personnel, and through you i would like to assure them we are absolutely committed. it is just that there are too many definitions going around yet, and we are looking for one on which all stakeholders agree. for me this is not a political agenda. skill india is something you have championed. how do you plan to make india the skill capital of the world? we have a large young population and it is very important to provide them with requisite education and skill-sets for gainful employment. accordingly, the government has placed maximum emphasis on this and has created a new ministry of skill development and entrepreneurship. the strategy is to upgrade and create new institutions to provide modern skills to our people. the ministry in consultation with state governments is mapping the available skills in each district. the skill curriculum is being revised, quality training of trainers and collaboration with private sector is being initiated. i am confident that with these efforts, we should be able to create a large pool of very skilled manpower that would act as a catalyst for our programme of “make in india”. it would also be available to other countries facing shortage of such skilled manpower. foreign policy has been a success area for you. what is thrust of your foreign policy, what is the mission with which you went to all these nations? first, i have travelled abroad no more than earlier prime ministers. the media needs to bring out facts, and not create wrong perceptions. then you can look at the outcomes. thus far we have been a balancing power, always seeking others’ favour. how long can we continue to do that? why don’t we grow into a global player? it is clear in my mind we are no more just a balancing power, but a global player. we speak on equal terms with all, whether it is the us or china. today we approach the world with greater self-assurance. we have shown the confidence to engage all major powers simultaneously and effectively. with our seven neighbours, our guiding principal is to have a humanitarian approach. even foreign policy ‘experts’ in the country have not noticed that our interaction with all these seven countries has been on humanitarian issues. we helped the maldives with drinking water; sri lanka pronounced the death sentence for five indian fishermen, but we brought them back alive, when they (upa) could not get one sarabjit from pakistan; in afghanistan we rescued father prem who had been kidnapped by the taliban. in nepal, we arrived immediately to do our duty as a neighbour. from yemen, we rescued people of 48 nationalities trapped amidst the fighting there; we saved some people from pakistan, and pakistan saved some of our people. what about iraq – punjabis are still being held captive there. in iraq, we have saved so many people, including nurses. on the other missing indians there, we don’t have very definite information, so we are hoping for the best. you are visiting bangladesh next week after resolving the border issue. will there be also a deal on the sharing of teesta waters? we had settled the long pending land boundary issues with bangladesh by taking all parties into confidence. the media has not realised this was a massive achievement and is talking of other issues. had this been elsewhere in the world this would have been cited as an example as big as the fall of the berlin wall. the entire mood of our neighbourhood has changed dramatically because of our message of shared prosperity being implemented on the ground. mine is practical and outcome-based diplomacy. do you think india can sort out the border issue with china as we did with bangladesh? i have just met the people of china, and realised that a window of trust is open. let’s see where it takes us. this is a very important relationship which has its complexities and challenges. i am deeply committed to improving our ties. president xi expressed similar sentiments during his interactions with me. creating a more positive environment to expand our economic cooperation and address outstanding differences on the border is the immediate goal. this can only happen if we ensure peace and tranquillity on the line of actual control. we need to show sensitivity to each other’s concerns. at the same time, mutual interest must guide our cooperative endeavours and i am confident that this will be the case. we have a huge negative trade balance with china and our engagement with them on the economic front is an attempt to address this by encouraging chinese companies to come and invest in india. but the chinese appear to be playing a dual game? india must have confidence in itself. world relations are not founded on suspicion. you invited nawaz sharif for your swearing-in ceremony. but after that relations have not moved forward? our effort at all times is to promote friendship with pakistan. all i can say is bombs do not help. we have had done enough of fighting, there have been wars, terrorism, but that has not got us anywhere. it is time we joined hands to fight poverty. people on both sides will benefit. the vision of cooperation, connectivity and contacts that i presented to leaders of our neighbouring countries remains very much on the table. with pakistan, obviously we can only progress in an atmosphere free of terror. they know that the basis of our engagement is the simla agreement and the lahore declaration. if they take a step forward accordingly, i am willing to take two. but there can be no compromise on our national security. in j&k, your party has formed the government with the pdp. that is historic. do you think the government will stabilise? will the issue of afspa be a hurdle? there is a larger picture there. we have to respect the mandate of the people. it could either be an elected government or governor’s rule. in the latter option, we would have had total control, but that is not what we wanted. it is a fact that the ideologies of the two parties are very different, but people wanted us to work together in both jammu and kashmir regions. the alliance in the state is one of the most important developments on the political scene. it has the potential to resolve one of our most difficult national problems through people’s participation and good governance. we need to understand that the two parties have varied views on some very important issues. however, we have taken a pledge to work for the development of the state and its people. both the parties have come together on an agreed common minimum programme. it is now our duty to rise to the expectations of the people of the state and implement the common minimum programme in letter and spirit and not digress from it. and the demand on lifting afspa? as i said, strictly follow whatever is agreed upon in the minimum programme. you have strong development agenda. but there are some leaders in the party and ministers in the government who speak out of turn. there is a feeling that some of your own people are not respecting the moratorium on communal tension that you had called for on independence day. it is not correct and wherever an individual view might have been expressed which is not in consonance with our ideology, we have immediately negated that. how long would you flog one instance? one minister said something inappropriate, he apologised in the house; the party as well as i condemned his statement. continuing to harp on these issues will not serve any purpose. it is a country of 1.25 billion, you can’t ascribe to the government everything that someone mutters. tell me what crisis has been there in the country in the past one year. so there is no reason for the minority communities to feel insecure? i have mentioned this earlier and let me emphasise it again: the constitution of india will be a guiding force for us and the unity and integrity of our country is our top-most priority. all religions and communities have the same rights and it is the responsibility of my government to ensure that all indians have equal rights and opportunities. in the second year, what can we expect from the government? it will be development, development and development. jobs, jobs and jobs.","' call achhe din get rid bad , achieved '","completing first year delhi , prime minister narendra modi speaks raj chengappa , editor-in-chief tribune group newspapers , challenges successes faced , plans future. well-known quick-fire manner , man gujarat takes jibes previous government leadership , keeping campaign mode alive. read full text. late prime minister rajiv gandhi , last person parliamentary majority , described people ’ expectations “scary ” . end one year , impression running government ?

2015-05-31,"no need for 126 rafales, will buy only 36: parrikar","new delhi, may 31 terming the upa’s proposed deal for 126 rafale fighter jets as “economically unviable” and not required, defence minister manohar parrikar has said the nda government will buy only 36 of the french aircraft, to be used for strategic purposes, and no more. parrikar also raised questions on the tendering process initiated by former defence minister a k antony and said his predecessor had “hammered” the tender in such a way that the rafale deal would have never seen the light of the day. rejecting criticism from the congress that prime minister narendra modi had bypassed the finance ministry and the defence acquisition council, the apex body of the defence ministry that takes the call on military projects, parrikar said “the deal is yet to be inked” and they should hold their horses till the process was complete. he expressed confidence that the committee, which has been set up to work out the contract, would complete the task in the next 2-3 months. the modi government has scrapped the over $20 billion deal for 126 rafales more than three years after dassault was declared the lowest bidder under upa’s tenure. ; during his visit to france last month, the prime minister announced the decision to buy 36 of these jets in a fly-away condition under a government-to-government (g2g) contract. parrikar underlined that the decision to acquire 36 rafales came in view of the “urgent requirement” of indian air force. “we are not buying the rest. we are only buying the direct 36,” parrikar told pti when asked what will happen to rest of the requirement. he said that the upa deal for 126 rafales was way too expensive and it would have hampered other modernisation plans of the indian military. the deal would have required around rs 1.3 lakh crore over a period of 10-11 years, he added. “would there be any money for any other work?” he asked. “i also feel like having a bmw and mercedes. but i don’t because i can’t afford it. first i can’t afford it and second i don’t need it. so, 126 rafales was economically unviable. it was not required,” parrikar said. attacking antony over the medium multi-role combat aircraft tendering process, parrikar said that his upa predecessor had “hammered” the tender in such a way that the rafales would have never seen the light of day. he also wondered why antony was trying to force the french firm dassault aviation, manufacturer of the rafale, to come back to him even after it was selected as the lowest bidder. “after l1 was determined, he said go ahead with cost negotiations and, after negotiations are complete, go back and check on methodology of l1, whether it was correct or not? “why did it happen? there are only two reasons. you are forcing your supplier to come back to you. what is the reason? he (antony) should answer,” parrikar said refusing to elaborate further. the minister underlined that rafales are not a replacement for mig-21s. he said that the migs would be replaced by the indigenous tejas light combat aircraft. explaining the strike capability of the rafales and the kind of weapons it is fitted with, parrikar said the french fighter jet was a “deep-striking fourth generation plus” aircraft. asked if the rafale deal meant that the modi government will only go through g2g deals for strategic assets in defence, parrikar said the defence procurement procedure does not prevent the government from using the g2g route. “that rafale deal (mmrca) of his (antony) through rfp would have never seen the light of the day. wherever there is a need of defence of this country, i will not hesitate to advise the prime minister to go for government-to-government deal,” he said. — pti ","need 126 rafales , buy 36 : parrikar","new delhi , may 31 terming upa ’ proposed deal 126 rafale fighter jets “economically unviable ” required , defence minister manohar parrikar said nda government buy 36 french aircraft , used strategic purposes , more. parrikar also raised questions tendering process initiated former defence minister k antony said predecessor “hammered ” tender way rafale deal would never seen light day. rejecting criticism congress prime minister narendra modi bypassed finance ministry defence acquisition council , apex body defence ministry takes call military projects , parrikar said “the deal yet inked ” hold horses till process complete. expressed confidence committee , set work contract , would complete task next 2-3 months. modi government scrapped $ 20 billion deal 126 rafales three years dassault declared lowest bidder upa ’ tenure. ; visit france last month , prime minister announced decision buy 36 jets fly-away condition government-to-government ( g2g ) contract. parrikar underlined decision acquire 36 rafales came view “urgent requirement ” indian air force. “we buying rest. buying direct 36 , ” parrikar told pti asked happen rest requirement. said upa deal 126 rafales way expensive would hampered modernisation plans indian military. deal would required around rs 1.3 lakh crore period 10-11 years , added. “would money work ?

2015-08-11,iaf halves its demand for russian fighter jets,"ajay banerjee  new delhi, august 10 looking to cut costs and prune military imports, the indian air force (iaf) has halved its demand for russian-built fifth generation fighter aircraft (fgfa). it now wants just three squadrons of the fighter jets which are to be inducted into the russian air force in 2016. sources say the iaf has scaled down its needs and now indicated that just three squadrons (around 18 planes in each), besides a few more for training of the pilots, will be enough for now. this works out to be 65 planes, almost half from the earlier projection of 127 fgfas to be jointly designed and produced by india and russia. ; the t-50 has been built for the russians under the pak-fa (prospective airborne complex of frontline aviation) programme for the fifth generation fighter aircraft. a plane will cost $100 million (rs 650 crore). three squadrons are the projection of an off-the-shelf deal india is pressing its military ally for immediate delivery of the planes. new delhi has suggested to moscow that the t-50 fighter jet can be supplied to the iaf, while the research to improve upon the aircraft can carry on simultaneously. the tribune had first reported about india’s offer on february 24 this year. simultaneously, the iaf is also working on a $11 billion r&d contract for long-term development of the jet. it is pending ratification since 2013. in a written reply to the rajya sabha on august 4, defence minister manohar parrikar said the preliminary design stage of the fifth generation fighter aircraft programme completed in june 2013. “the expenditure incurred so far is rs 1,483.15 crore,” parrikar said. the next stage of development of the fifth generation fighter aircraft will commence after signing of the r&d contract. the problem is in case india opts for the r&d contract route, the deliveries are envisaged to commence 94 months – eight years. the next best option is to go for an immediate off-the-shelf purchase and in case the research-and-development contract works out, more jets can be produced here. with a dwindling fleet of fighter jets, this wait is not an option for the iaf, said sources. by the end of this year, the iaf would be at its lowest combat strength in more than a decade. it will be down to 32 squadrons by the end of this year and in the middle of a predicted shortage. in a nutshell, the iaf with 576 fighter jets will be well short of the 750-strong fighter jet fleet mandated by a government sanction to wage a simultaneous two-front war with pakistan and china. the pruning down of numbers has been done as the iaf is backing its own options of getting french-origin rafale jets and the remaining batch of 72 sukhoi-30 mki jets from russia, sources say. prime minister narendra modi during his visit to france in april this year announced the intent to get 36 rafale jets. a cost negotiation committee is in talks with the french company and the numbers could go beyond the announced 36 as the iaf has projected a demand for 80 rafale-type planes.

2015-08-12,india-france rafale deal in trouble over sales terms: officials,"new delhi, august 12 india’s order of 36 french-made rafale fighter jets has run into trouble with government officials struggling to agree sales terms, sources said, four months after prime minister narendra modi intervened to break a logjam in previous commercial negotiations. two senior indian defence officials told reuters that both sides were wrangling over the unit price of the aircraft and a condition that plane-maker dassault aviation invest a big percentage of the value of the multi-billion dollar contract in india. the problems threaten to further delay the modernisation of india’s ageing air force. military officials have warned of a major capability gap opening up with rivals china and pakistan without new western warplanes or if local defence contractors cannot build what the military needs in a timely manner. modi and french president francois hollande announced the government-to-government deal for the sale of the off-the-shelf rafale fighters on april 10. ; that followed three years of commercial negotiations with dassault for 126 aircraft that stalled due to disagreements over assembling most of the aircraft in india. citing india’s urgent defence needs, modi chose to deal directly with paris for a smaller order, saying officials would work out the details. on may 16, indian defence minister manohar parrikar told local media that negotiations over pricing would be finished in a “month or two”. but those talks were bogged down over india’s insistence on a lower price for the frontline warplanes than the roughly $200 million each that was discussed with dassault during the commercial talks, said the two defence officials, who have been briefed on the new negotiations. under the previous proposal, dassault was to assemble 108 of the aircraft in india, a move new delhi hoped would help boost a high-tech local aerospace industry. there is no production in india in the new arrangement. “since there is no technology transfer, the price that was on the table during the commercial talks cannot stand,” said one of the officials, who declined to be identified because he was not authorised to speak to the media. the indian defence ministry said negotiators were in talks to produce a draft agreement, but declined to give details. parrikar said last week that new delhi had told paris in april it wanted the jets as soon as possible. a dassault spokesman declined to comment, as did the french defence procurement agency. debate over offsets the two indian officials said another sticking point was new delhi’s standard requirement that arms makers invest a percentage of the value of any deal above $50 million in india. such so-called offset policies are not unusual in the developing world, where western defence firms have invested in local technology and jobs in return for sales. in this instance, india wants dassault to invest at least 30 percent of the contract value in india through activities such as the sourcing of components for future french operations, the setting up of manufacturing facilities in india or by providing high-tech job training, the officials said. france has said it was ready to meet the offset obligations, but that it would take time to set up a vendor base in india for components for example and that this could push up the deal’s cost, the first defence official said. “unless this is waived at the highest levels, the defence ministry is proceeding on the basis that offset requirements have to be met,” the official said. during the commercial negotiations, india had set the offset bar at 50 percent of the contract, the official added. “this issue has become bigger than the procurement,” said amit cowshish, a former financial advisor on arms purchases to the indian defence ministry, who has been tracking the negotiations. different priorities complicating matters, the indian air force (iaf) had asked for technical modifications so the latest weapons could be fitted to the jets, the second defence official said. initial technical specifications, which were part of the commercial negotiations, were outlined a decade ago when india began the process of seeking new fighters. a french source familiar with the matter said differing priorities within india were delaying matters, with the air force focused on weaponry and the defence ministry on offsets. “all along the iaf has asked for more armaments than what dassault has offered while the indian administration has demanded offsets,” the source said. the air force declined to comment, saying the deal was in the government’s hands. the rafale fighters are meant to fill a gap in an air force deployed for a two-front war against china and pakistan. a domestic programme to build a light combat aircraft to form the backbone of the air force is 19 years behind schedule, with the first plane due for final operational clearance in march 2016. meanwhile, nearly 260 mig 21 and mig 27 cold war-era fighter jets are due to be phased out in about eight years. “even with the entry of the rafales, the air force has reconciled itself to depleted aircraft strength over the next decade,” said retired air vice marshal kapil kak. — reuters ",india-france rafale deal trouble sales terms :

the sources said the offset clause will simply drive up the cost of each aircraft. it is not just the offset clause that the french are worried about. indian air force wants to integrate an israeli helmet mounted display with the rafale fighter jets besides tweaking the weaponry technology so that the aircraft can fire a missile other than what the rafales carry. the missile, sources said is of american make. “the changes asked for are not like changing tyres in cars. it takes time, effort and money, all of which will again drive up the cost,” the sources said. also, india wants to set up two bases for the 36 rafale jets. this means twice the planned machinery, testing facilities besides others which would again jack up the prices, the sources said. both qatar and egypt, which have struck similar deals with the french government, have gone in for one base only. “can understand that india’s strategic needs might be different but generally two bases are needed when one has more than just two squadrons of a particular aircraft. setting up of two bases will also cost more,” the sources said. “the benchmark for the prices is already there since the deals with egypt and qatar have been struck. the price of the aircraft to india cannot be less than what the other two countries have bought it for,” the sources said. they added that no talks have been held between the two sides in the recent past, indicating a likely stalemate. — pti","france rejects offset clause , agrees ‘make india ’","new delhi , august 16 french government rejected indian negotiators ’ demand 50 per cent offset clause citing sharp cost escalation offered participate ‘make india ’ projects carry forward talks 36 rafale fighter jets hit turbulence. defence sources said india ’ insistence offset clause , tweaking weaponry technology plans set two bases rafale fighter jets would lead cost escalation. offset policy first introduced part defence procurement procedure ( dpp ) , 2005 , foreign company invest back portion deal india. “the 50 per cent offset clause part original tender floated 126 fighter jets. french president indian prime minister decided go direct purchase 36 rafale jets. , 50 per cent offset clause asked french offering fighters rate air force buying , ” defence sources said. added french instead offered undertake ‘make india ’ initiatives. “the french look option making falcon business jets india even rafales future besides projects , ” sources said , adding french government made clear companies would like part ‘make india ’ initiative. ;

2015-10-04,india will continue to procure foreign fighter jets: iaf chief,"ajay banerjee  new delhi, october 3 facing a dwindling fleet of fighter jets, the indian air force (iaf) will continue to procure foreign fighter jets as banking entirely on the locally produced, lca tejas, may not be enough either in numbers or capability. though it looks as a setback to the “make in india” initiative, it’s a pragmatic balance between being “war-ready” and waiting for still-developing indigenous technologies. the iaf chief, air chief marshal arup raha, while addressing a press conference here today, said, “the tejas alone cannot meet the needs of the iaf in numbers or the roles the iaf is needed to play. we need more multi-role combat fighter jets (rafale-type),” he said and listed out options from russia and a long term — more than 15 years away – plan for a locally produced fighter jet with a foreign design partner. ; the government in april this year announced a deal to get 36 of the twin-engine rafale jets in a fly-away condition from french-maker dassault aviation. “the iaf has projected a need for six squadrons (16-18 planes in each squadron) of rafale-type planes,” he said confirming what was first reported in the tribune in its edition dated july 4 this year. on being asked if the iaf wanted more rafales, the iaf chief said, “i may wish to have rafale. but there are equally good aircraft. if the deal is good, the government can decide on more. there are alternatives. i cannot say i only want rafale. i want capability of rafale-type aircraft. so the government will have a look at it and based on urgency and the type of contract is signed with dassault aviation, further decisions may be taken by the government. i cannot predict.” “at the moment cost negotiation is on. we should be able to ink the contract by the end of this calendar year. it will take two to three years for the first squadron to be raised,” he added. on the tejas, the iaf chief said, he was looking at 120 of the tejas that will include four major upgrades proposed by the hindustan aeronautics limited (hal). so far, only 40 have been ordered. on being asked if the order beyond 40 planes will be the “tejas mark-2” with upgraded engines, raha said, “let’s just call it tejas. we are not insisting on mark-2 for now. it will incorporate characteristics such as mid-air refueling, missiles and improved radars.” later sources said the engine of the upgraded version would not change from the present standard fitment of us-produced ge 404. the first lot of tejas is likely to get final operational clearance by march next year. raha said the targeted 42 fighter squadrons — needed for a simultaneous war with china and pakistan — would be in place by 2027. as of now, the iaf has 35 fighter jet squadrons. a mixed ancestry and level of technology marks the fleet, largely imported from russia over the past 30 years. british and french companies have supplied around 150 planes. the iaf needs 400 jets over the next 10-12 years. there are some 260 obsolete mig-21s and mig-27s (soviet union-era single-engine fighter jets) in the fleet and these have to be replaced on priority. the iaf chief, on being asked about the russian plan to supply attack helicopters to pakistan, said, “let’s not make a mountain of a molehill. the french have supplied mirage (fighter jet) to pakistan and also to us. the us supplied f-16 (fighter jet) we use. let’s not look at it narrowly.” on having a chief of defence staff, raha said, “the chief of staff committee has given its recommendations. having a cds is the priority of the government.”",india continue procure foreign fighter jets : iaf chief,"ajay banerjee new delhi , october 3 facing dwindling fleet fighter jets , indian air force ( iaf ) continue procure foreign fighter jets banking entirely locally produced , lca tejas , may enough either numbers capability. though looks setback “make india ” initiative , ’ pragmatic balance “war-ready ” waiting still-developing indigenous technologies. iaf chief , air chief marshal arup raha , addressing press conference today , said , “the tejas alone cannot meet needs iaf numbers roles iaf needed play. need multi-role combat fighter jets ( rafale-type ) , ” said listed options russia long term — 15 years away – plan locally produced fighter jet foreign design partner. ;

2015-10-07,modi pushes ‘obsolete’ tejas aircraft on iaf,"new delhi, october 7 the central government has turned down the military’s request to expand the acquisition of 36 fighter planes from dassault aviation sa to plug vital gaps, officials said, nudging it to accept an indigenous combat plane 32 years in the making. prime minister narendra modi’s decision, in line with his make-in-india policy to encourage domestic industry, is a blow for not only the french manufacturer but also others circling over the indian military aviation market worth billions of dollars. the push for india’s struggling tejas light combat aircraft (lca) also comes at a time when the air force is at its weakest operational strength since the 1962 war against china, which is causing anxiety within military circles. since it took over last year, the modi administration has repeatedly said its overriding goal is to cut off the military’s addiction to foreign arms which has made it the world’s top importer. the air force wanted the government to clear an additional 44 rafale medium multirole aircraft on top of the 36 that modi announced during a visit to paris this year that are to be bought off-the-shelf to meet its urgent requirements. ; but a defence ministry official said defence minister manohar parrikar had told the air force that there weren’t enough funds to expand the rafale acquisition and that it must induct an improved version of the indigenous tejas-mark 1a. “the iaf (air force) needs to have a minimum number of aircraft at all times. the lca is our best option at this stage, given our resource constraints,” the defence official said. “the rafale is our most expensive acquisition. the lca is our cheapest in the combat category.” the air force says it requires 45 fighter squadrons to counter a “two-front collusive threat” from pakistan and china. but it only has 35 active fighter squadrons, parliament’s defence committee said in a report in april citing a presentation by a top air force officer. with the drawdown of soviet-era mig 21 planes under way, the air force would be down to 25 squadrons by 2022 at the current pace of acquisitions, it told the committee. cleared by the government in 1983, the lca designed by the government’s defence research and development organisation (drdo) was meant to be the backbone of the air force due for induction in 1994. instead, it suffered years of delay and chaos with scientists trying to build the world’s most modern light combat aircraft from scratch, including the engine. eventually, they scrapped the engine, turning to ge aviation and lowering their ambitions for a state-of-the-art fighter. so far, only one aircraft has been produced and even that is awaiting final operational clearance, now delayed to early 2016. “in january this year, they had given one lca ... which had not completed its flight testing. they handed over the papers to us. we do not make a squadron with one aeroplane. that is where we are,” said an air force officer speaking on condition of anonymity. safety concerns an independent investigation by the comptroller and auditor general of india into the lca programme identified 53 “shortfalls” in the plane. in a report in may, the auditor said that the plane wasn’t as light as promised, the fuel capacity and speed were lower than required and there were concerns about safety. retired air marshal m. matheswaran, a former deputy chief of the integrated defence staff, said the lca was “obsolete”. “it is a very short-range aircraft which has no relevance in today’s war-fighting scenarios. if you are trying to justify this as a replacement for follow-on rafales, you are comparing apples with oranges.” he said the plane was at best a technology demonstrator on which indian engineers could build the next series of aircraft, not something the air force could win a war with. “we would like to have the mmrca (medium multi-role combat aircraft) variety of aircraft. at least about six squadrons, to my mind,” the head of the air force, arup raha, said at the weekend, referring to the rafale class of fighters. but k. tamilmani, the drdo’s aerospace chief, said the modified version of the tejas addressed most of the air force concerns. these included electronic warfare system, flight computer, radar and maintenance problems. “almost all the problems get solved with the 1a. there will always be scope for improvement, but there are no flight safety issues,” he said. state-run hindustan aeronautics limited would be able to ramp production to 16 a year by 2017 to meet the air force’s demands, he said. “we indians are extremely good at blaming each other — at blaming it all on indian production.” dassault declined any comment on the government’s decision to cap the rafale fleet. a source close to sweden’s saab, which has been pushing its gripen light fighter, said that it was respectful of india’s decision to try to develop its domestic military base. “there’s still a huge gap that needs to be filled. we are marketing it (the gripen) under the make-in-india umbrella,” he said. “even if you add the seven squadrons of the tejas, there is still a requirement (with migs retiring etc). it’s a question of timing. can they build these for when they need them?” — reuters ",modi pushes ‘obsolete ’ tejas aircraft

ability to hit enemy targets which are further away due to its flight radius of some 1,000 km; be available for five sorties per day instead of three of the sukhoi 30 mki; a new set of onboard radars to help pilots navigate and also strike; a new set of missiles that hit targets further away; and infusion of new technology in the indian air force that is presently operating at its lowest level of fighter jets in the past decade. ; the rafale will bridge the shortfall of the fast-dwindling fighter squadrons. india needs 45 fighter squadrons to counter a combined threat from pakistan and china. currently, it has only 33, where each squadron has 18-20 jets. of these, the vintage mig-21 and mig-27 form 11 squadrons. the sukhoi 30-mki populates 10 squadrons, the 1970s design british jaguar six, followed by french mirage 2000 and soviet union’s mig-29 in two and three squadrons, respectively. the last three are being upgraded with better missiles and avionics. rafale will be in some ways be superior to what the chinese presently have in their arsenal, but beijing is producing its own platforms and weapons and with the next generation j-20 fighter jet getting established, india will need to carry forward its plans rapidly and catch up with beijing over the next five-six years by widening its ‘make in india’ footprint. the first of the rafales will start coming in by september 2019 and the full fleet shall be operational by april 2022. in the intervening period, the ministry of defence (mod) led by manohar parrikar, needs to focus on a multi-pronged approach to meet future needs. the rafale deal was negotiated for 18 months – ‘lightning fast’ going by mod’s record. as the good news filters in, the mod is already working on multiple options – at least four of which are known – to bridge the technology gap of the iaf and add newer planes. the first is to quickly induct the 106 tejas “mark-1a”. the mod has set a 2018 deadline for the first aircraft to be ready with a target to complete its production by 2022-23. the second is to have an additional assembly line of indian-made fighter jets. this could be a joint venture with a us or european company setting up a plant in collaboration with an indian partner. the third is completion of the production schedule of 272 of the sukhoi 30-mki, expected by 2020. the fourth is to ink an agreement with russia to co-develop and produce a fifth generation fighter aircraft (fgfa) with stealth features and the works. the sukhois were ordered in phases since 1997, the iaf wants 272 of these in its fleet by 2020. the agreement for the fgfa is expected to be inked when prime minister narendra modi and russian president vladimir putin meet next month. make deal details public: antony new delhi: the opposition congress on saturday expressed concern over the “diluted” rafale aircraft agreement reached between india and france yesterday and demanded that details of the deal be made public. former defence minister ak antony raised several question marks on “sufficiency” of the deal asking the bjp-led government how it planned to arm the iaf with a mere 36 aircraft deal. “during the upa’s tenure, it was decided to purchase 126 medium multi-role combat aircraft to meet the iaf’s urgent operational requirement. as per the iaf, 126 was the minimum operational need then. today, the scenario is even more critical. what is the plan of the government?” said antony, addressing reporters on saturday. the former minister cited the sanctioned strength of the air force as 42 squadrons and said in the current volatile situation, the country needed more, and not less, jet strength. “the sanctioned strength is 42 squadrons and the available strength is 32 squadrons. by 2022, this strength will be reduced to 25 squadrons. how will the government equip the iaf with more aircraft,” asked antony. antony asked how the government would bridge the gap with respect to china and pakistan who were augmenting their air strength. — tns boeing to supply harpoon missiles to india washington: the us department of defence has given a $81 million contract to boeing for the supply of all-weather, over-the-horizon harpoon anti-ship missiles to india. according to the contract details, boeing has been awarded $81,271,024 for firm-fixed-price modification to a previously awarded firm-fixed-price contract to exercise an option for the procurement of 22 lot 89 harpoon missiles, associated containers and components for the government of india under the foreign military sales programme. the missiles are expected to be ready in june 2018. pti",rafale widen arch operations,"ajay banerjee new delhi , september 24 equipped latest missiles widen arch offensive operations , rafale fighter potential game-changer india ’ airborne capability several fronts. india signed contract france buy 36 jets cost rs 58,828 crore , huge sum modern technology come cheap. chiefly rafale provide : dependability latest technology-backed air-strike platform ;

""our next customer, which we believe to be very soon ... we will produce those aircraft out of that (greenville) facility,"" he said. ""as you look beyond that, the opportunity for india is to then move all of that into india and that's what's being proposed ... to have a single production line in india that would service the new production requirements of global demand, the global market."" ; india's government is set to issue a formal request to lockheed and saab over the next few days to provide information about their plans to design, develop and produce combat jets in india, a government official said. the planes will be produced under a new 'strategic partnership' policy under which the foreign aircraft maker will collaborate with an indian firm to develop a world-class indigenous aeronautical base that india has struggled to build for decades. lockheed has picked tata advanced systems as its local partner, while saab has not yet announced its indian collaborator to produce the gripen e aircraft that it has offered to the air force. howard said the plan to relocate the f-16 plant to india enjoyed the support of the us government after initial concerns it would conflict with president donald trump's 'america first' campaign under which he has pressed for companies to invest in the united states and create jobs. howard said winning the indian contract worth billions of dollars would protect thousands of jobs at lockheed in the united states as well as at dozens of components suppliers, since the indian facility will come up gradually. ""we will start with an assembly, you can't go from ground zero, from a standing stop to full production in a week. you have to phase it in."" india's air force is running short of hundreds of aircraft as its indigenous light combat aircraft programme is dogged by delays and quality issues. modi's government last year cleared the purchase of 36 rafale combat jets from france's dassault aviation, scaling back a plan to buy 126 planes, leaving the air force scrambling for replacements. reuters ",lockheed offers export f-16 jets proposed india facility,"new delhi , august 29 lockheed martin closing international deal f-16 fighter planes , offered eventually build jets proposed plant india wins bigger order supply indian air force , top executive said. us defence giant sweden ' saab two horse-race equip indian military least 100 single-engine jets produced locally prime minister narendra modi ' ' make-in-india ' plan. randall l. howard , leads f-16 business development , said lockheed offering make india sole f-16 production centre , eventually make planes india , also countries. lockheed closing f-16 production line forth worth , texas , supply new orders new facility greenville , south carolina. plan eventually build planes india , howard told reuters.

you could have just remained silent,” he said in bhuj, not specifying how and where gandhi had hailed saeed’s release. ; gandhi had recently tweeted: “narendrabhai, baat nahi bani. terror mastermind is free. president trump just delinked pak military funding from let. hugplomacy fail. more hugs urgently needed.” the tweet had come after the release of let founder and 26/11 mastermind saeed by a pakistan court. hitting out at the congress over a recent meme targeting his “chaiwala” past, the prime minister said in jasdan that he is being targeted by the main opposition party because of his humble background and for being born to a “poor mother”. “they are feeling uneasy because a chaiwala became the pm. we used to read in books how the downtrodden get harassed by those in higher strata. but i never imagined they would stoop so low,” modi said in his speech in gujarati at jasdan ahead of the first round of polling on december 9. he said he gets messages from people threatening him that they would once again turn him into a tea-seller. “i want to tell them that i am modi, who is ready to sell tea but will never commit the sin of selling the entire country,” he said, in an apparent reference to scams during the congress-led upa rule. “why are you mocking poverty? why are you insulting a poor mother?” he asked. in an apparent bid to woo the influential patidars, who seem to be drifting towards the opposition party, modi said the congress “harassed” four former chief ministers of the community because of a “grudge” against gujarat. babubhai jashbhai patel, chimanbhai patel, keshubhai patel and anandiben patel belonged to the patidar community. without directly accusing the congress of fanning the protests, modi said the opposition had done everything to “disturb” the bjp’s anandiben patel-led government. “they fanned violence to disturb her. this congress party harassed four patidar cms just because the people of gujarat never accepted the party.” at the bhuj rally, modi pitched the election as a fight between trust on development and dynastic politics. he asked the people of gujarat not to forgive congress leaders as they had levelled baseless allegations on the “son of gujarat” who has a stainless public life. during his campaign in the state in the last few days, gandhi had trained his guns at the modi-led government over the rafale fighter aircraft deal. he also alleged during his campaign that modi is not a “chowkidar” (watchman) but a bhagidar (partner) in “corrupt” practices in bjp president amit shah’s son jay shah’s company. modi said he had written a poem, saying that gujarat is his ‘atma’ (soul), while bharat is his ‘parmatma’ (god), that gujarat is his mother and he her son. “i have grown up on this soil, you gujaratis know my plus and minus points, what was good in me has evolved due to this ‘mitti’ (soil) due to my mother (gujarat),” he said, seeking to emotionally connect with voters. the prime minister said gujaratis will not forgive those attacking its child. recalling sardar patel, he said the congress should understand that gujarat tolerated insults when atrocities were committed against him but the times had changed and they would not do so again. modi said many people have come here for election campaigning and “sprayed muck”. “farmers prepare their land before the start of the monsoon season. in the same way, much muck has been sprayed here. it is good as it will help the lotus (bjp’s election symbol) bloom.” modi referred to the 26/11 terror strike and the attack in uri and asked what the difference was between one government and another, one leader and another. “they killed our soldiers in uri, our soldiers went inside their territory, conducted a surgical strike and came back. the next day a newspaper said they (in pakistan) carried bodies in trucks,” he said. modi alleged that the congress raised questions on the surgical strike in september 2016. “they could not respect indian army, they asked questions like none of our soldiers was injured?

2018-04-30,"karnataka and after, will win every election: rahul","aditi tandon  new delhi, april 29 addressing his maiden national rally after assuming congress presidency last december, rahul gandhi on sunday invoked religion to attack “bjp’s untruths” and prophecised that the congress would win every election starting karnataka and going up to the 2019 lok sabha polls. “elections are round the corner. in 2014, bjp and rss spread lies about congress and its leaders. the truth is now getting revealed. the strength of congress workers was evident in gujarat… now you see how we win karnataka, chhattisgarh, rajasthan, madhya pradesh and 2019 elections,” declared a combative gandhi in contrast to his usually self-effacing style as he addressed the ‘jan aakrosh’ rally at ram lila grounds here. the remarks sought to position congress as the pole of opposition unity amid talks of a non-congress, non-bjp front. gandhi said congress was the water needed to build india’s foundations and that’s why he believed it would win every election. ; he then used generous references to religion to argue that while the basis of faith is truth, bjp is “seeped in falsehoods”. later, gandhi accused the pm of lying about his promises and wondered what kind of a pm narendra modi was! “india is a country of faith and faith rests on truth. it is truth we bow to when we visit shrines but when the pm talks, people struggle to find truth. in karnataka, with bs yedyurappa on his side, the pm says he’s fighting corruption. people wonder what he is saying,” gandhi quipped in a 40-minute speech which he ended with the announcement to undertake the kailash mansarovar yatra after the karnataka elections. even here, gandhi addressed the dominant hindu voters by attributing his escape in a recent aircraft scare to lord shiva. “as my aircraft fell 8,000 feet, i thought i was gone. but then i remembered i have to visit kailash mansarovar. now i seek leave of 10 to 15 days from you all to travel,” rahul gandhi told his workers. sounding the poll bugle, he attacked the pm for silence on corruption, on anxieties raised by four supreme court judges, on unemployment, on dying farmers, on atrocities against dalits, minorities, women and children and on the failure to rein in china. “youth trusted the pm when he promised two crore jobs a year. now they realise this government is hollow. fm arun jaitley says farm loan waiver is not government policy. so the only option for farmers is to commit suicide. farmers can’t live without congress,” a ballistic gandhi said, slamming the pm for “having tea with the chinese president” while the dragon expanded its doklam presence. no pm in 70 years travelled to china without an agenda for discussion, was gandhi’s refrain. he dwelt most on the alleged bjp corruption, citing the party’s nomination of a “once jailed yedyurappa” as karnataka cm candidate; alleged sale of a company to a power firm by former power minister piyush goyal, financial rise of bjp chief amit shah’s son, pm’s move to buy “overpriced” rafale jets from france and nirav modi’s escape with people’s money. “for the first time ever, four judges came to people for justice but the pm is silent. the judges mention bh loya but the pm is silent. all institutions are being filled with rss people but the pm is silent; a woman is raped by a bjp mla in up but he is silent. in j&k, a child is violated, he is still silent,” rahul gandhi said in a caustic build-up against the pm. the congress chief also used the occasion to rev up party cadres for battles ahead, terming congress workers as “sher ke bachhe” who have sacrificed their lives for truth”. while he assured space and respect for everyone — from 80 and 90 year olds to 18 year olds in congress — he equally signalled that fighting the bjp in unison was more important than dissenting publicly. so gandhi publicly ticked off ex-law minister salman khurshid for taking a stand contrary to the party’s on the cji’s impeachment and later in reference to babri masjid demolition saying that congress’ hands were stained with the blood of muslims. “salman khurshidji is sitting here. some days ago he expressed a different opinion. i accept that there will be varied viewpoints in our party and i will allow these to flourish, but will say one thing. when the party is fighting bjp-rss, we need to fight with unity,” gandhi said. as he spoke, former congress president sonia gandhi, former pm manmohan singh sat in the front row with seniors ghulam nabi azad, ak antony, mallikarjun kharge, ahmed patel, janardan dwivedi, punjab cm capt amarinder singh and ex haryana cm bs hooda, among others. the congress chief’s ""space for all"" assurance found quick reflections on the faces of veterans, who graciously smiled. the eldest of the lot was 90-year-old aicc treasurer motilal vora. nothing but ‘parivar aakrosh’ rally: shah a dynasty and courtiers, sent out of state after state by ‘jan aadesh’, now pretend to represent ‘jan aakrosh’. the congress rally is nothing but a ‘parivar aakrosh’ rally. —amit shah, bjp national chief","karnataka , win every election : rahul","aditi tandon new delhi , april 29 addressing maiden national rally assuming congress presidency last december , rahul gandhi sunday invoked religion attack “bjp ’ untruths ” prophecised congress would win every election starting karnataka going 2019 lok sabha polls. “elections round corner. 2014 , bjp rss spread lies congress leaders. truth getting revealed. strength congress workers evident gujarat … see win karnataka , chhattisgarh , rajasthan , madhya pradesh 2019 elections , ” declared combative gandhi contrast usually self-effacing style addressed ‘jan aakrosh ’ rally ram lila grounds here. remarks sought position congress pole opposition unity amid talks non-congress , non-bjp front. gandhi said congress water needed build india ’ foundations ’ believed would win every election. ; used generous references religion argue basis faith truth , bjp “seeped falsehoods ” . later , gandhi accused pm lying promises wondered kind pm narendra modi !

2018-05-17,"atmosphere of fear in country, situation similar to pakistan: rahul","raipur, may 17 against the backdrop of political developments in karnataka, congress president rahul gandhi on thursday claimed the situation in the country was similar to that in pakistan under “dictatorship”. at an event here, he alleged there was an atmosphere of fear in the country and the constitution was under “severe attack”, with even the institutions such as the judiciary and the press being suppressed and threatened. his remarks came hours after bjp leader b s yeddyurappa was sworn-in as the chief minister of karnataka. while the congress-jd(s) combine in the state has been claiming a majority with the support of 117 mlas, the bjp has 104 seats in the assembly which has 224 elected members. polling was not held in two seats. the house has a nominated seat. “the constitution is under severe attack in the country... in karnataka, the mlas are on one side and the governor on the other and you know what attempt is being made,” gandhi said. ; “the jd(s) leader has said its mlas were offered rs 100 crore,” the congress president said, apparently referring to h d kumaraswami who had made the allegation. gandhi said, “one after another, you can see in every democratic institution in the country... the rss is trying to induct its people.” he said, “there is fear in the judiciary, there is fear in the press, and even the bjp’s members of parliament are scared as they cannot speak a single word before the prime minister.” in the last 70 years, it was generally seen that the people approached the judiciary for seeking justice, he said. “but for the first time it was seen that four judges of the supreme court appeared before the press and sought support from the public, saying they were being suppressed and not allowed to perform their duties. “such a thing was witnessed for the first time in a democratic country. it definitely happens under dictatorships, it happens in pakistan, it happens in different african countries, (where) a general comes and suppresses the court and the press. but in india, it has happened for the first time in last 70 years,” gandhi said. he was apparently referring to the unprecedented press conference by four senior judges of the supreme court in january this year to express their grievances against the chief justice of india. in his address at a ‘jan swaraj sammelan’ here on the occasion of the silver jubilee of 73rd and 74th amendment in the constitution related to local self-governance, the congress leader accused the bjp and the rss of capturing every democratic institution in country. he said the congress had ruled the country for several years but never tried to capture the democratic institutions. gandhi also alleged that the rss and the bjp’s target was to suppress the voice of dalits, ‘adivasis’ (tribals) and women and distribute the country’s wealth to some select people. “when farmers talk about loan waiver, (finance minister) arun jaitley says the centre does not have any policy for it. but in the last one year, rs 2.5 lakh crore loan of 15 rich people was waived. he (jaitley) doesn’t speak on it because it’s in their policy,” the congress chief said. he said that if the bjp wanted to talk about corruption, then its leaders should speak about the rafale fighter deal, bjp chief’s son and (union minister) piyush goyal’s company. however, he did not elaborate on it. gandhi alleged the bjp government has snatched the rights of farmers, villagers and poor and diluted the law. he said the people will have to come together to fight against the ideology of the rss and the bjp to protect the constitution. “if we want to fight against the ideology of the rss and the bjp, the representatives and women who are sitting here, are our key strength,” he said, referring to the panchayat members present at the event. during the interaction with the representatives, gandhi said if the congress comes to power at the centre, its focus will be on education, health and employment sectors in which the “modi government has completely failed”. he said his party’s government would waive farmers’ loans within 10 days of coming to power in 2019. accusing the modi government of considering farmers as a burden, he said the congress considers them as its strength. “if the narendra modi government can waive loans of 15 to 20 rich industrialists worth rs 2.5 lakh crore, why can’t farmers’ loans be waived?” he asked. “that amount is equivalent to rs 35,000 crore that the upa spent to implement the mnerga scheme in the country,” he said. he said, “modi calls mehul choksi as mehul bhai. he knows choksi and nirav modi well. modi did not respond to my request to waive farm loans in the entire country.” the congress government had brought the land acquisition bill, in which it was clearly mentioned that panchayat’s permission should be mandatory for acquiring land in a village, gandhi said. “the attack on me (by the bjp) was launched since the day i visited bhatta parsaul (in 2011 in noida in up). there i had raised questions and from that day they have been trying to corner me,” he said. pti","atmosphere fear country , situation similar pakistan : rahul","raipur , may 17 backdrop political developments karnataka , congress president rahul gandhi thursday claimed situation country similar pakistan “dictatorship ” . event , alleged atmosphere fear country constitution “severe attack ” , even institutions judiciary press suppressed threatened. remarks came hours bjp leader b yeddyurappa sworn-in chief minister karnataka. congress-jd( ) combine state claiming majority support 117 mlas , bjp 104 seats assembly 224 elected members. polling held two seats. house nominated seat. “the constitution severe attack country ... karnataka , mlas one side governor know attempt made , ” gandhi said. ;

""i did not say india is a hindu pakistan. i said if the bjp wins again and has the strength in both houses of parliament and the states, there will be nothing restraining them from fulfilling their project of creating a hindu rashtra, which would be a mirror image of pakistan (since it too would be state for a religious majority) and so reduce us to a hindu pakistan,"" he clarified. members of the bjps youth wing—bhartiya janata yuva morcha (bjym)—had defaced tharoor's office in kerala while demanding an apology for his ""hindu pakistan"" comments. explaining his 'taliban in hinduism' remark, tharoor said he used the expression after the attack on his constituency office. after the attack, tharoor at a public rally in thiruvananthapuram had said, ""who gave them the right to decide i can't live here and must go to pakistan? are they saying that because i am not their kind of hindu, i have no right to be in india? are they starting a taliban in hinduism?"" ""but whether i had said any of this or not, the bjp will seize on anything to promote their agenda of communal polarisation, because they have no other achievements to point to,"" he alleged. the senior congress leader also accused the bjp of making efforts to take away the focus from real issues, claiming that on the real issues the saffron party will lose. tharoor asserted that inclusive politics was good for the country, and alleged that the bjp had unleashed a ""climate of hatred, intolerance and division that will only hurt india"". he said that in the run up to the 2019 polls, the congress would raise issues such as inflation, the rise in prices of fuel and cooking gas, increase in unemployment, the ""disaster of demonetisation"", the ""botched rollout of the gst"", agricultural stagnation and farmer suicides among others. asked if the leadership issue among opposition parties would be settled after the general election depending upon the number of seats they get, tharoor said, ""probably. each party has its own leader. ours is rahul gandhi."" on the bjp's charge that the congress indulges in appeasement of minorities, he asked that if the minorities had been appeased for so long, why were the muslims disproportionately poor, less literate, more unemployed than other communities.

""the upa contract priced the rafale jets at rs 526 crore per aircraft and the nda contract priced them at rs 1,670 crore per aircraft. if these numbers are correct, will someone explain why the prices jumped three times? the government says it is a secret agreement. but a dassault aviation report has already quoted the price,"" he said. chidambaram said the deal was made by stating that the aircraft were being brought in a fly-away condition on ""emergency purpose"" as the squadrons of the indian air force are depleting, but ""not a single aircraft"" has arrived in india so far. ""if they wanted the aircraft on an emergency purchase basis, they would have ensured that the first aircraft lands in the country within a few months. so, this is certainly not an emergency purchase,"" he said. during the upa deal, he said, there was a clause that offset obligations of dassault aviation would be performed by state-owned hindustan aeronautics ltd (hal). but, under the new contract by the nda government, dassault was given the opportunity to choose its offset partner and it had picked a private company for this purpose, the senior congress leader said. ""under the upa government deal, technology was to be transferred to hal and it was to make 108 aircraft... but, under the nda contract, there was no transfer of technology and hal has been completely kept out of the agreement,"" chidambaram alleged. ""why didn't the government ask dassault to choose hal as its offset partner and why there is no transfer of technology? there are no answers to these questions,"" he said. chidambaram said the charge by the bjp that previous governments, too, did not disclose the price of defence acquisitions is completely baseless, as the upa government had “time and again” disclosed the prices of such deals. ""we had revealed the prices of ins vikaramaditya, the sukhoi and mirage aircraft on the floor of parliament. all of these taken together lead to great suspicion. why is the government so secretive about the price and why are they refusing to answer questions and coming up with lame excuses?"" he asked. pti",govt ignored defence procurement procedure rafale deal : chidambaram,"kolkata , august 25 stepping attack government rafale fighter jet issue , senior congress leader p chidambaram saturday accused centre ignoring defence procurement procedure "" bypassing "" several committees secure deal. also called detailed inquiry contract. chidambaram demanded public debate prices negotiated aircraft congress-led upa government "" gone three times "" deal negotiated bjp-led nda dispensation.

2018-08-29,decoding rafale deal: what’s all the fuss about?,"new delhi, august 29 as congress president rahul gandhi and arun jaitley engage in a social media war about india's purchase of 36 combat jets from france for an estimated rs 58,000 crore, here's an explainer to help understand what the agreement was. what is rafale? rafale is a french twin-engine multi-role fighter jet designed and built by dassault aviation. the rafale jets are considered one of the most potent combat jets globally. the upa deal india began the process to buy a fleet of 126 medium multi-role combat aircraft (mmrca) in 2007 after the defence ministry, headed then by congress leader ak antony, cleared the proposal from the indian air force. ; the contenders for the mega deal were lockheed martin's f-16s, eurofighter typhoon, russia's mig-35, sweden's gripen, boeing's f/a-18s and dassault aviation's rafale. after a long process, bids were opened in december 2012 and dassault aviation emerged as l-1 (lowest bidder). in the original proposal, 18 planes were to be manufactured in france and 108 in india in collaboration with the hindustan aeronautics ltd. there were lengthy negotiations between the then upa government and dassault on prices and transfer of technology. the final negotiations continued till early 2014 but the deal could not go through. details of the negotiated price per rafale were not officially announced, but it was suggested by the then upa government that the size of the deal would be $10.2 billion. the congress claimed per aircraft rate including avionics and weapons was zeroed in at rs 526 crore (as per euro exchange rates prevailing then). the nda deal during his visit to france, prime minister narendra modi on april 10 announced india would purchase 36 rafale jets in a government-to-government agreement. after the announcement, questions were raised by the opposition on how the prime minister finalised the deal without approval of the cabinet committee on security. a joint statement issued on april 10, 2015, after talks between modi and then french president françois hollande, said they agreed to conclude an inter-governmental agreement for supply of 36 rafale jets on terms that would be better than conveyed by dassault aviation as part of a separate process underway. the statement said the ""aircraft and associated systems and weapons would be delivered on the same configuration as had been tested and approved by indian air force, in clear reference to negotiations and testing process for the rafale jets under the upa government. the final deal india and france signed euro 7.87-billion (rs 59,000 crore approximately) deal on september 23, 2016, for 36 rafale jets. the delivery of the aircraft will start from september 2019. the deal was finalised on the basis of the procurement procedure followed under the upa government. the allegations the congress has been accusing massive irregularities in the deal, alleging that the government was procuring each aircraft at a cost of over rs 1,670 crore as against the upa’srs 526 crore. the party has also demanded answers from the government on why state-run aerospace major hal was not involved in the deal. the congress has also sought to know price details of the aircraft and how the rate per aircraft has gone up from rs 526 crore to rs 1,670 crore. the government has refused to share the details, citing a secrecy clause of a 2008 pact between india and france. congress' ak antony, who was defence minister in 2008 when india and france inked an inter-governmental agreement on defence procurement, said the government's claim that the secrecy clause was forcing it to not reveal price details of the deal was ""totally wrong"". the party claimed that qatar had purchased 12 rafale fighter jets in november 2017 for $108.33 million per aircraft (rs 694.80 crore). the congress has also alleged the government was benefiting the reliance defence ltd (rdl) through the deal as the company has set up a joint venture with dassault aviation to execute the offset obligation for the rs 59,000 crore deal. the party has claimed that reliance defence was instituted merely 12 days before the announcement of the rafale deal on april 10, 2015. the rdl has rejected all the charges. under india's offset policy, foreign defence entities are mandated to spend at least 30 per cent of the total contract value in india through procurement of components or setting up of research and development facilities. on october 3, 2016, rdl and dassault aviation announced a joint venture (jv) in the aerospace sector, and a year later, foundation stone of a manufacturing facility was laid in mihan, nagpur. government’s response minister of state for defence, while replying to a question in parliament two years ago, had said the cost of each rafale aircraft is approximately rs 670 crore but did not give details of prices of associated equipment, weapons and services. later, the government refused to talk about the prices. it has been maintaining that the cost of 36 rafale jets cannot be ""directly compared"" with the original proposal to buy 126 combat aircraft because the ""deliverables"" were significantly different. finance minister arun jaitley wrote a facebook post on monday, accusing congress and its leader rahul gandhi of ""peddling untruth"" and carrying out a ""false campaign"" on the deal. he said the deal signed by the nda government was on better terms than the one agreed to in 2007 under the upa regime. pti",decoding rafale deal : ’ fuss ?,"new delhi ,

the previous upa government started negotiating in 2012 with french dassault aviation to buy 126 medium multi-role combat aircraft (mmrca). the plan was for dassault aviation to supply 18 rafale jets in flyaway condition while 108 aircraft were to be manufactured in india by the company along with hal. however the deal could not be sealed. the congress has demanded answers from the government on why hal was not involved in the new deal. sitharaman said the upa deal collapsed as hal did not have the capability to produce 108 aircraft in india. “even during negotiation with hal, dassault felt that the cost with which the hal will produce would be far higher than the aircraft produced in france. that was the reality,” she said. the defence minister said the then government could have come forward and pumped in resources into hal, but they did not. she said she has no intention of undermining hal, but “why could not the then defence minister say that we will pump in all the required resources into the hal. he could have done it. that was not done”, sitharaman said, adding that the current government was initiating steps to strengthen the state-run aerospace company. in 2016, the modi government signed a government-to-government deal with france for purchase of 36 rafale jets at a cost of rs 58,000 crore. the congress has been alleging irregularities in the deal. rebutting charges of corruption in the deal, the defence minister also asserted that people of the country have put a closure on the issue as they have trust in prime minister narendra modi. “there is a trust in the prime minister. he is not going to be corrupt. so with all this, i think mentally, people of india have reached a closure on it, saying there is no corruption here,” she said. sitharaman ruled out calling the opposition parties for a meeting to allay their concerns over the rafale deal, saying they are “throwing an allegation” without any basis as well as showing no concern for operational preparedness of the air force. in a hard-hitting attack on congress, she said the party was running short of issues and corruption was a plank on which it utterly failed. “it is one of the cleanest governments india has ever seen. on corruption, the congress is very frustrated. the party will have to learn from this government. i am saying this with a certain sense of confidence and not arrogance. the defence ministry is being run without any middleman and in a transparent way. we have proved that defence procurement can happen without middlemen,” she said. on antony's intervention, she said he held back the file at a stage where he did not have any role to play. however, she did not elaborate on reasons for antony's action. the congress has repeatedly criticised the deal for the 36 rafale jets, alleging that the government was procuring each aircraft at a cost of over rs 1,670 crore as against rs 526 crore finalised by the upa government. sitharaman said the rs. 526 crore figure refers to the bare aircraft, capable of just flying and landing, and does not take into account the avionics, arsenal and other associated technologies that make it a complete fighting machine. pti",poor health hal led collapse rafale deal upa : nirmala sitharaman,"new delhi , september 13 negotiations procurement 126 rafale jets upa government fell state-run hindustan aeronautics ltd required capability produce jets india collaboration french company dassault aviation , defence minister nirmala sitharaman said thursday. sitharaman also said unprecedented intervention 2013 defence minister ak antony cost negotiation committee giving final touches deal put final nail coffin. rounds negotiations hal , dassault aviation felt cost rafale jets escalate significantly produced india , said interaction pti editors reporters agency ' headquarters here. “dassault could progress negotiations hal aircraft produced india , guarantee product produced given. big-ticket item iaf would want guarantee jets. hal position give guarantee , ” said. sitharaman said weapon systems , avionics key add-ons rafale aircraft , expected delivered beginning september 2019 , "" much superior "" negotiated upa , government getting planes 9 per cent cheaper earlier agreed upon. ;

they are misleading the country with something which was not even agreed to during the upa government. you are throwing an allegation saying there is a fraud. you did not care for operational preparedness of the air force,” she told pti in an interview. the defence minister was asked whether the government will engage with opposition parties the way the then prime minister manmohan singh in 2005 had taken the opposition into confidence and addressed their apprehensions to pave way for finalising the nuclear deal with the us. “it (rafale deal) is an inter-governmental agreement. you (opposition) have asked us questions and i have given answers to them in parliament. then what am i calling them for?

2018-10-02,one can’t use un as political platform: tharoor on swaraj’s speech,"hyderabad, october 2 congress mp shashi tharoor on tuesday lashed out at the bjp for criticising him for describing external affairs minister sushma swaraj’s un address as a “campaign” speech and alleged that the saffron party “politicised” foreign platforms. hitting out at the congress leader, bjp had earlier said the opposition party defied a convention of all political parties speaking in the same voice on india’s stand abroad. “bjp wants...and criticise me, i will also be equally harsh and say, i must say that they have really disappointed all true patriots by the way in which they have politicised foreign platforms. they have done so starting with the prime minister and now ending with the foreign minister,” tharoor told reporters here. ; “this is not the way in which india should conduct its foreign policy. i am quite confident that if the congress party comes back to power, we will not fight our political battles abroad,” he said. questioning whether swaraj’s address was a un speech or bjp slogans, tharoor had tweeted that she devoted the first half of her speech mentioning prime minister narendra modi’s vision for a “new india” and discussing programmes as the swachh bharat mission. “bit rich to be criticised by the bjp for describing sushma swaraj’s speech as a campaign speech. she mentioned narendra modi 10 times during her address and spoke about/on behalf of india only five times. if you use the un as a political platform you can’t hide behind the flag,” tharoor said. tharoor told reporters here he was normally very supportive of the union government in international forums because “national interests transcend political interests.” “unfortunately, this bjp government has been completely ignoring this time-honoured principle. we have had the prime minister attacking his predecessors on foreign soil. he has been going around, saying the congress has let the country down abroad,” he said. criticising swaraj, he alleged that she made a “campaign speech” instead of speaking to foreign delegates at the un forum. “here is a foreign minister goes to an international podium like the united nations general assembly and instead of speaking to the delegates from other countries, she delivers a blatant campaign speech in hindi...,” he said. tharoor claimed he was “very mild” in his criticism of swaraj’s speech, saying he was disappointed that the external affairs minister chose to use an international forum to make what was a political speech “aimed at her voters in india rather than at the international audience.” bjp spokesperson sudhanshu trivedi had said the congress is being increasingly seen to be standing with pakistan as tharoor’s statement was not an isolated incident and the opposition party often spoke the language of the neighouring country. he said the congress should apologise to the country and said its stand on various issues appeared similar to that of pakistan in “intent, language and style”. on sunday, tharoor had reportedly said in kerala that swaraj’s speech was aimed at her party’s voters on the subject of pakistan rather than constructing a positive image of india in the world. trivedi had said, “there has been an established convention in politics since independence that political parties are unanimous on foreign issues, at least when it comes to taking a stand at the united nations (un) where india’s position is not of a political party.” “pakistan has always opposed us there. for the first time a senior congress leader is also criticising,” he had said, adding tharoor had earlier used the term “hindu pakistan” to attack the bjp’s rule. the bjp leader had also cited comments of congress leaders like mani shankar aiyar and ghulam nabi azad to liken it with pakistan in its opposition to the modi government. he said the congress has lost the “moral right” to claim to be the party of mahatma gandhi, wondering if the congress in zeal to oppose prime minister narendra modi was also opposing the country. tharoor, who was in hyderabad to attend a meeting of the ‘congress professionals’ unit, also hit out at the nda government over demonetisation and the rafale deal. replying to a query if prosecution should take place in the deal and whether congress would do so if it is voted to power, he said “congress believes that a thorough investigation is required.” joint parliamentary committee would be the right mechanism to do that, he said. asked about the farmers’ protests in delhi tuesday, he said congress has been pointing out the “betrayal of the indian farmer” by the bjp government. tharoor was also critical of the trs government in telangana which, he alleged, supported the nda government on various issues. “voters in this state must realise that a vote for the trs is a vote for the bjp,” he said. — pti",one ’ use un political platform : tharoor swaraj ’ speech,"hyderabad , october 2 congress mp shashi tharoor tuesday lashed bjp criticising describing external affairs minister sushma swaraj ’ un address “campaign ” speech alleged saffron party “politicised ” foreign platforms. hitting congress leader , bjp earlier said opposition party defied convention political parties speaking voice india ’ stand abroad. “bjp wants ... criticise , also equally harsh say , must say really disappointed true patriots way politicised foreign platforms. done starting prime minister ending foreign minister , ” tharoor told reporters here. ;

2018-10-25,cong links cbi chief’s ouster to rafale probe,"aditi tandon  new delhi, october 24 the congress and aam aadmi party today linked the removal of cbi chief alok verma to the rafale scam probe and accused the government of sending him on leave in violation of the law and supreme court judgments. while the rjd and cpm sufficed to question the government’s powers to do what it did asking what it was trying to hide, congress president rahul gandhi and aap chief arvind kejriwal alleged a rafale angle behind dramatic developments that saw verma and his deputy rakesh asthana being sent on leave pending inquiry. “cbi chief alok verma was gathering documents on the rafale scam. he has been sent on forced leave. pm’s message is clear. he will destroy anyone who dares to expose him in the rafale scam. the country and the constitution are in danger,” gandhi tweeted from rajasthan after finance minister arun jaitley wondered how the congress knew what the cbi director was going to do in the matter (rafale). delhi cm kejriwal also asked if verma had been ousted because he was about to start an investigation into the rafale scam, “which could have become a problem for the pm?” officially, the congress alleged verma’s removal was in the wake of recent rafale exposures and close on the heels of the party petitioning cag and cvc in the matter. “there is enough evidence in public domain to suggest action,” congress spokesperson abhishek singhvi said when asked if his party knew of cbi’s potential moves on rafale. ; while the verma-rafale link would remain at the core of congress’ political attack against prime minister narendra modi ahead of elections in four states, the party also challenged the legality of the move involving verma’s ouster. “the cvc is only a supervisory body for the cbi. it can’t recommend sending cbi director on leave. under supreme court judgments and the delhi police establishment act (cbi act) as amended in 2014, the authority to appoint, remove or transfer the cbi director, is vested with the selection committee consisting of the pm, the leader of opposition in lok sabha and the chief justice of india. the government’s over clever act of sending the cbi chief on leave is illegal,” singhvi argued. the congress asked why the government didn’t take the matter before the selection committee if it was convinced the cbi chief needed to be sent on leave. “was the government afraid the committee would say no?” said singhvi. about fm jaitley’s justification that both officers, facing counter-charges of corruption, were sent on leave to ensure a “fair” cvc probe, congress contended the government was trying to unfairly equate accusations against asthana with those against verma. “fraud equivalence is sought to be achieved. charges by the accused against the prosecutor are being given priority even when the accused has faced charges from the day he was appointed cbi special director. he is facing the grave accusation of extortion, which the pm is overlooking. clearly asthana is a blue-eyed boy,” singhvi quipped. congress’ angst also stems from the fact that under the upa regime, then law minister ashwani kumar had to be dropped following accusations of what the party says was “mere affidavit settlement with the then cbi director in the coal scam”. “here the pm is interfering directly to save asthana by calling the cbi director home. the question is of morality, legality and constitutionality,” reasoned the congress. ‘bjp bureau of investigation’ cbi has now become so called bbi (bjp bureau of investigation) — very unfortunate!
