2015-05-30,"'call for achhe din was to get rid of the bad, we have achieved that'","completing his first year in delhi, prime minister narendra modi speaks to raj chengappa, editor-in-chief of the tribune group of newspapers, on the challenges and successes he faced, and plans for the future. in his by now well-known quick-fire manner, the man from gujarat takes jibes at the previous government and its leadership, while keeping his campaign mode alive. read the full text. the late prime minister rajiv gandhi, who was the last person with a parliamentary majority before you, described people’s expectations of him as “scary”. at the end of one year, what is your impression of running the government? from the potential i have seen in the country, i believe there is no logic in it staying poor and underdeveloped. countries that attained freedom much later have developed more than us; we too could have been there. there is nothing lacking in the country. i won’t go into where we went wrong or who did wrong. when i spoke of swachh bharat on august 15 last year, i knew i was taking a risk, but i was amazed at the response that i received, it was beyond my imagination. even the media that is usually critical of the government (which is natural and how it should be) has been furthering this particular campaign. such has been the awareness created today that children point out to their parents if they litter. i must admit even though i am pained to see filth, i was not confident if i would be able to create a culture of cleanliness, but people have caught on. they are not going to have any personal gains from this, yet they are working for it. this has shown the real strength of the country. then i have seen the strength of the government machinery. when i declared we’ll open bank accounts before january 26, everyone was shocked: this is something that has never happened in 60 years, what is this man saying! but within around 100 days, before december 25, the targets were nearly met by all. the government machinery and bank employees went to people’s homes. this shows if given clear guidance and road map are given, government employees have the ability to deliver results. what has been your main thrust in the first year, what did you want to do? the country had seen such ‘burre din’, everything was at a standstill, so the foremost question on my mind was where do i begin? i was new for delhi, delhi was new for me, i had also not had much interaction with delhi or its bureaucracy. so to shed light to see how things were, i started with small trials to see if the system’s frequency matched mine or not. and within three i months i found it matched perfectly. that gave me a huge confidence. for instance a concept like being punctual to work; we didn’t take out a circular, i just started arriving on time myself and soon i saw people all around had started doing that. so far no one has faced action for being late; i take a sympathetic view of the matter, a person could be late because of some family issue, he can’t be sacked for that. so i combine self-discipline in personal life with a humane approach to others. in all of this, my 13 years’ experience has been of tremendous use. ; what is the difference you find between running a state, as you did in gujarat, and running a nation? fundamentally there is no difference. ultimately, you have to run the administration, do human resource management. but at the centre there are certain new domains, such as defence or foreign affairs. one issue is that in states you have an organic team, but at the centre it is an assembled team that has come in from states for two or three years. so to run the government in delhi, one has to set up a team that is homogenous and has members who will spend 30-35 years here, a team that will be able to function here. people keep taunting you with the question where are the ‘achhe din’? what exactly do you mean by achhe din and have you delivered? when visiting an ailing person, we say don’t worry, he’ll be well [“achha ho jayega”]. the word ‘achha’ [good] here is in the context of the ‘burra’ [bad] that the patient is going through. so my idea of ‘achhe din’ is riddance of that bad. and i believe we have achieved this. our opponents started with making fun of the idea, asking every time a train would be late if it were achhe din. it would have been good if these people had asked the congress ‘gareebi hatao’ has been your slogan since 1970, has it happened? they had a strength of 415 in parliament, four people of one family have run the country, what did they achieve? so my definition of achhe din is in the context of everyday life and the ‘bad days’ that prevailed — corruption, scams, policy paralysis, black money, coal, spectrum.... the country was fed up with all of this. and you have changed that in this one year? there is no question of such things now. what do you hear on coal auctions now? rs 3 lakh crore will come to the government’s coffers. how did you bring about this ‘cleaning up of corruption’? there has to be zero tolerance on this matter at the top. just my being honest is not enough. it should be visible in my speech, conduct, manner, policy, tradition, everything. i alone being ‘pure’ will not do. the way to achieve this is to lay down a policy on everything in black and white. the grey areas should be minimal, even if they can’t be zero. bureaucrats then have very little scope for discrimination; that in turn leaves no scope for corruption. are there going to be more measures to block corruption like this? i’ll give you instances: the government used to buy led bulbs at rs 348, now it is rs 80. a cement sack was procured at rs 360, now it is rs 150 — though my figures may not be exact. what about bringing back the black money that was promised? first of all, none of those who have been in power thus far have any right to question my government on black money. all this black money was generated because they took no measures to check it. despite directions from the supreme court, they did not constitute an sit for three years. this means people holding black money were given that period to cover their trails. had they acted the day the court gave the orders, the country would have gained billions of rupees. the first decision of our first cabinet meeting was to create an sit, which is given all information, and it passes it on to the supreme court in sealed covers. yes, we don’t inform the media because there are international legal issues involved. to get black money back from abroad we need cooperation of countries around the world. at the g20 summit, i ensured an entry regarding cooperation on black money in the final resolution. so can we expect all people hoarding black money will be caught and their names revealed? names we can give only to the supreme court because we are bound by law, but we are going to spare no one. i would ask the tribune as well to give us any information it may have on black money. has anyone dared to create a law as tough as we have on this? despite your efforts against corruption the opposition calls you are a ‘suit-boot ki sarkar’, you favour corporates. i want to request a group of senior journalists to compile a list of all the criticism that has been there against my government. someone finds meanings for the acronym m.o.d.i., some say nda is mnda, some call us arrogant, others discuss a suit or a boot, or coat or hair. just look at their bankruptcy, they are not being able to identify a single concrete issue. this is the greatest achievement of this government. an issue that concerns punjab and haryana particularly is farmer distress. the charge is that the centre did not move quickly enough when unseasonal rain damaged farmers’ crops and they were committing suicide. also why did you not visit the affected people? let us look at the record. as chief minister of gujarat — which was struck by calamities every other year — i had got tired of submitting memorandums to the central government, but they did not so much as glance at us. this year after the hail damage, chief ministers in all bjp-ruled states immediately visited farmers, officials were sent out to survey the damage. there had been a long-standing policy that compensation would be paid to farmers only if the damage was more than 50 per cent. we brought that down to 33 per cent. the compensation was increased by 50 per cent. earlier, damaged grain was not procured by government agencies. this time we decided to procure all grain, and that too without any cut in the msp. these were decisions for which farmers had been crying for years. as for my visiting farms, tell me if a congress leader has visited a farm in the past 10 years. were there no farming calamities? as chief minister i used to regularly visit farmers. my job now was to collect information, take decisions, mobilise the machinery. i did not go to nepal either, but did we not do work there? your party agreed with the land acquisition bill. now it is trying to amend it. why? people allege it is anti-farmer and pro-corporate. for 60 years they went with the old land acquisition laws. were they anti-farmer all this while? those who have forced 3 lakh farmers to commit suicide have no moral authority to complain now. the earlier law was 120 years old. for political interest they hurriedly brought in a law. in parliament they agreed orally to accept the changes suggested by the bjp, particularly regarding irrigation. but later on they removed those from the draft. after the nda came to power, we realised there were certain points in the law that would have made the farmers’ situation worse if we did not bring in the ordinance. also, chief ministers of several states ruled by various parties came to demand changes in the law, including kerala. we could not have made it a point of ego to say that we won’t change the law just because we supported it in 2013. our intention is to amend only those provisions in the 2013 act that militate against the process of growth and are against the interest of farmers. the reforms in this act will ensure greater irrigation potential, rural infrastructure, including electricity, schools and hospitals. the debate should be on merit. are you confident of getting the bill passed in parliament? this is not a matter of life or death for me. and neither was it the agenda of my party or the government. the initiative was in response to a demand from the states, and being a federal structure it was my duty to respond. so i am trying my level best. i am still prepared to accept any suggestions. do you plan a new deal for the farmers? the farmer is the backbone of our nation; 60 per cent of the population is engaged in farm-related activities. however, agriculture’s contribution to the gdp is only 15 per cent. we need to modernise agriculture to improve productivity and quality. we have introduced soil health cards which would help the farmer in reducing his cost and increase productivity. the prime minister’s krishi sinchai yojana will improve the irrigation potential. to provide banking facilities to farmers, we have successfully launched the jan dhan yojana, which provides overdraft facility also. what would you list as your major achievements in the past one year? i can say with pride that there has not been a single instance of corruption. our mission and commitment is towards the country’s progress. we have embarked on a path of transparency, efficiency and effectiveness in our policies. initiatives like the jan dhan yojana, swachh bharat abhiyan, soil health card and the recently launched social security schemes for the people at large are aimed at giving more income and security to the common man. on infrastructure, last year we awarded projects for the construction of more than 20 km of roads per day, and the construction has been achieved at a rate of more than 11 km per day. electricity generation has shown a growth of 9 per cent in 2014-15 over the previous year. emphasis on renewable energy is demonstration of the fact that we not only care about the present but also the future. the recent union budget gave a boost of rs 1 lakh crore to the infrastructure sector through public investment. pooling of gas for stalled power projects and fertiliser units shows our commitment to address the bottlenecks of the previous government. we have taken up the task of construction of toilets in every school. it is unfortunate that even after almost 68 years of independence our schools did not have functional toilets. our initiative of distribution of lpg and scholarships through direct bank transfers to beneficiary accounts is evidence of our intentions to focus on the poor and needy. new interventions on ganga rejuvenation, skill development, mobile and broadband connectivity for all villages, and ‘make in india’ is going to open new vistas of growth. this is just a beginning. on the economy, are you satisfied with the progress made so far with regard to inflation, jobs, growth in production, investment and exports? the 10-year period of the previous government was characterised by high prices and spiralling inflation. our efforts on both the demand and supply side have ensured that inflation is under check. it inflation is now well below 5 per cent. our efforts on economic front have been appreciated not only within the country but also by international organisations like imf, world bank and the oecd. as soon as we came to power we took proactive steps against hoarding, released additional food grains in the market and imported items that were in short in supply in the country. these steps have borne fruit and the inflation that was hovering around 10-12 per cent has now been moderated. in spite of inheriting an economy with huge problems we have been able to take corrective action that is visible from the fact that we have in the last year limited our fiscal deficit to 4 per cent as against our target of 4.1 per cent. foreign direct investment has risen by 39 per cent and foreign institutional investment (fii) has grown by 800 per cent. the foreign currency reserves are at an all-time high of us $35 billion. this also shows tremendous confidence of foreign investors in our economy. the gdp growth last year was 7.4 per cent. in the current year india’s gdp growth is expected to be the highest amongst all major economies of the world. we have taken more initiatives in this budget. mudra bank will help more than 6 crore small vendors and businesses, 61 per cent of who are sc, st, religious minorities or obc. we have also introduced the gst bill in parliament and are committed to its rollout from april 1, 2016. on ‘ease of doing business’, we have made substantial progress. these measures will mark a watershed in our growth story. we have made substantial progress in rationalising our procedures and forms. we are putting more and more approvals online. we have also relaxed fdi in various sectors, especially insurance. but people say you have been lucky with inflation, as oil prices went down substantially. when i say i am lucky, people attack me, they don’t like it! what is this? we have taken steps on inflation, but this is a volatile matter, and needs continued efforts. we’ll not leave it to luck. your call to “make-in-india” is significant. what has been the response? the response to the initiative has been very significant not only within india but outside as well. wherever i travelled in the past one year, i met senior executives of industry in that country and they all were very excited about our “make-in-india” plan. we have undertaken not only policy reforms but also focused on administrative reforms. we have laid emphasis on ease of doing business, making government more accountable, introducing technology in governance and reforms in all layers of government. we have essentially taken the reform process to an entirely different level where both the central and the state governments respond through a policy-based system and not by way of discretion or nepotism. similarly we are emphasising that the companies supplying defence equipment to us undertake to manufacture in india also. on defence, you went to france and made a bold decision to purchase 36 rafael fighter aircraft. people have questioned the rationale behind this step. a good government has to strike the right balance between different priorities. “make in india” is very important for me. so too is ensuring national security. i will not compromise on either. the purchase of rafale aircraft was guided by the need to respond to the immediate operational requirements of the air force which was affecting our defence capability. how can that be questioned? in fact, the challenge is to break a logjam that we inherited from the previous government. some decision had to be taken. we consulted all concerned and decided that we will have only a government-to-government deal. there will be transparency, so no one will be able to raise questions. there will be further discussions on this matter soon. i would mention that during my recent visit to france, the senior leadership of their defence industry showed great enthusiasm for participating in our “make in india” programme. do you think this way is going to be the future of defence procurement? that will be decided case to case. will you deliver on the one-rank-one-pension (orop) promise to the defence personnel? we are committed to orop, but we are in consultation with defence personnel regarding the definition of orop. our government is here for five years, and we cannot do anything without consulting the people concerned. the dialogue is being actively pursued. there is no need to have any doubt on this. the tribune has a large readership among defence personnel, and through you i would like to assure them we are absolutely committed. it is just that there are too many definitions going around yet, and we are looking for one on which all stakeholders agree. for me this is not a political agenda. skill india is something you have championed. how do you plan to make india the skill capital of the world? we have a large young population and it is very important to provide them with requisite education and skill-sets for gainful employment. accordingly, the government has placed maximum emphasis on this and has created a new ministry of skill development and entrepreneurship. the strategy is to upgrade and create new institutions to provide modern skills to our people. the ministry in consultation with state governments is mapping the available skills in each district. the skill curriculum is being revised, quality training of trainers and collaboration with private sector is being initiated. i am confident that with these efforts, we should be able to create a large pool of very skilled manpower that would act as a catalyst for our programme of “make in india”. it would also be available to other countries facing shortage of such skilled manpower. foreign policy has been a success area for you. what is thrust of your foreign policy, what is the mission with which you went to all these nations? first, i have travelled abroad no more than earlier prime ministers. the media needs to bring out facts, and not create wrong perceptions. then you can look at the outcomes. thus far we have been a balancing power, always seeking others’ favour. how long can we continue to do that? why don’t we grow into a global player? it is clear in my mind we are no more just a balancing power, but a global player. we speak on equal terms with all, whether it is the us or china. today we approach the world with greater self-assurance. we have shown the confidence to engage all major powers simultaneously and effectively. with our seven neighbours, our guiding principal is to have a humanitarian approach. even foreign policy ‘experts’ in the country have not noticed that our interaction with all these seven countries has been on humanitarian issues. we helped the maldives with drinking water; sri lanka pronounced the death sentence for five indian fishermen, but we brought them back alive, when they (upa) could not get one sarabjit from pakistan; in afghanistan we rescued father prem who had been kidnapped by the taliban. in nepal, we arrived immediately to do our duty as a neighbour. from yemen, we rescued people of 48 nationalities trapped amidst the fighting there; we saved some people from pakistan, and pakistan saved some of our people. what about iraq – punjabis are still being held captive there. in iraq, we have saved so many people, including nurses. on the other missing indians there, we don’t have very definite information, so we are hoping for the best. you are visiting bangladesh next week after resolving the border issue. will there be also a deal on the sharing of teesta waters? we had settled the long pending land boundary issues with bangladesh by taking all parties into confidence. the media has not realised this was a massive achievement and is talking of other issues. had this been elsewhere in the world this would have been cited as an example as big as the fall of the berlin wall. the entire mood of our neighbourhood has changed dramatically because of our message of shared prosperity being implemented on the ground. mine is practical and outcome-based diplomacy. do you think india can sort out the border issue with china as we did with bangladesh? i have just met the people of china, and realised that a window of trust is open. let’s see where it takes us. this is a very important relationship which has its complexities and challenges. i am deeply committed to improving our ties. president xi expressed similar sentiments during his interactions with me. creating a more positive environment to expand our economic cooperation and address outstanding differences on the border is the immediate goal. this can only happen if we ensure peace and tranquillity on the line of actual control. we need to show sensitivity to each other’s concerns. at the same time, mutual interest must guide our cooperative endeavours and i am confident that this will be the case. we have a huge negative trade balance with china and our engagement with them on the economic front is an attempt to address this by encouraging chinese companies to come and invest in india. but the chinese appear to be playing a dual game? india must have confidence in itself. world relations are not founded on suspicion. you invited nawaz sharif for your swearing-in ceremony. but after that relations have not moved forward? our effort at all times is to promote friendship with pakistan. all i can say is bombs do not help. we have had done enough of fighting, there have been wars, terrorism, but that has not got us anywhere. it is time we joined hands to fight poverty. people on both sides will benefit. the vision of cooperation, connectivity and contacts that i presented to leaders of our neighbouring countries remains very much on the table. with pakistan, obviously we can only progress in an atmosphere free of terror. they know that the basis of our engagement is the simla agreement and the lahore declaration. if they take a step forward accordingly, i am willing to take two. but there can be no compromise on our national security. in j&k, your party has formed the government with the pdp. that is historic. do you think the government will stabilise? will the issue of afspa be a hurdle? there is a larger picture there. we have to respect the mandate of the people. it could either be an elected government or governor’s rule. in the latter option, we would have had total control, but that is not what we wanted. it is a fact that the ideologies of the two parties are very different, but people wanted us to work together in both jammu and kashmir regions. the alliance in the state is one of the most important developments on the political scene. it has the potential to resolve one of our most difficult national problems through people’s participation and good governance. we need to understand that the two parties have varied views on some very important issues. however, we have taken a pledge to work for the development of the state and its people. both the parties have come together on an agreed common minimum programme. it is now our duty to rise to the expectations of the people of the state and implement the common minimum programme in letter and spirit and not digress from it. and the demand on lifting afspa? as i said, strictly follow whatever is agreed upon in the minimum programme. you have strong development agenda. but there are some leaders in the party and ministers in the government who speak out of turn. there is a feeling that some of your own people are not respecting the moratorium on communal tension that you had called for on independence day. it is not correct and wherever an individual view might have been expressed which is not in consonance with our ideology, we have immediately negated that. how long would you flog one instance? one minister said something inappropriate, he apologised in the house; the party as well as i condemned his statement. continuing to harp on these issues will not serve any purpose. it is a country of 1.25 billion, you can’t ascribe to the government everything that someone mutters. tell me what crisis has been there in the country in the past one year. so there is no reason for the minority communities to feel insecure? i have mentioned this earlier and let me emphasise it again: the constitution of india will be a guiding force for us and the unity and integrity of our country is our top-most priority. all religions and communities have the same rights and it is the responsibility of my government to ensure that all indians have equal rights and opportunities. in the second year, what can we expect from the government? it will be development, development and development. jobs, jobs and jobs.","' call achhe din get rid bad , achieved '","completing first year delhi , prime minister narendra modi speaks raj chengappa , editor-in-chief tribune group newspapers , challenges successes faced , plans future. well-known quick-fire manner , man gujarat takes jibes previous government leadership , keeping campaign mode alive. read full text. late prime minister rajiv gandhi , last person parliamentary majority , described people ’ expectations “scary ” . end one year , impression running government ?

""our initial target is that all schools, particularly where the girl child goes, by june, which is this month, we should have a 100 per cent rate of toilets. it has been included as a part of the csr (corporate social responsibility) programme. a lot of incentives in our fiscal policy have also been announced,"" jaitley said here at the swachh bharat programme adopted by jubilant foodworks, the owner of the famous fast food chain domino's pizza. he termed swachh bharat as ""a preventive health care programme"".

2015-06-25,pm launches 3 mega schemes for transforming urban india,"new delhi, june 25 prime minister narendra modi today said private property developers should not decide how a city should grow and the decision should be taken by residents and the city leadership, as he unveiled three mega flagship urban schemes aimed at developing cities as engines of growth. (read also: criteria for selection of ‘smart cities’ announced) urbanisation should be viewed as an opportunity and urban centres should be viewed as growth engines, he said launching the atal mission for rejuvenation and urban transformation (amrut), smart cities mission, and housing for all (urban) here. “under these schemes we can go ahead and we can do it together (centre and state). india is rapidly urbanising.your browser does not support the video tag.your browser does not support the video tag.your browser does not support the video tag. every year hindustan gives birth to a small country,” he said. while 500 cities will be developed under amrut scheme, there would be 100 smart cities over five years and housing for all aims construction of 2 crore houses in urban areas in the next seven years. ; smart city will be selected through a competition among cities while 500 cities are being identified under amrut. referring to smart city, modi said, “for the first time in india, a challenge was being floated, in which the citizens of urban india could contribute in the formulation of development visions of their cities.” those cities which were able to competitively meet the required parameters would be developed as smart cities. “this competitive mechanism would end the top-down approach, and lead to people-centric urban development,” he said. “these urban development schemes were not prepared by the government alone, but involved perhaps the biggest consultation exercise ever taken by the union government, involving all stakeholders and examining global best practices,” he said. stressing that all schemes for urban development should move forward based on people’s participation, modi said, “there is a lack of holistic vision about urban planning, and expansion is driven not by the administrators of a city, but by property developers. “through amrut, the aim of the government is to give cities themselves the chance to plan their future growth,” he said. the prime minister said the people assembled for the function here had on them the collective responsibility for better quality of life for 40 per cent of india’s population that either lived in cities, or were dependent on cities for their livelihood. the prime minister stressed that aspirations of migrants from rural areas, and slum dwellers, should be balanced with the changing global environment and said ensuring a good life for them is the government’s responsibility. giving a simple vision of a smart city, he said it is one which was a step or two ahead of people’s aspirations. “there should be facility for walk-to-work because today a person spends maximum time in travelling to office and gets very little time to work,” modi said. besides transportation, technology also plays a key role and there should also be provision for energy efficiency, and cycling etc. lamenting the state of affairs in urban areas, he said, “if this had been done 25-30 years ago, it would have led to good results today, but better late than never. schemes which had a clear vision and were people-centric, were the need of the hour.” seeking replication of best practices from across the country, the prime minister mentioned hyderabad’s tax collection system, karnataka’s efforts for solid waste management, and chhattisgarh’s work to eliminate open defecation. chhattisgarh, which is fighting maoist menace, is making an all out effort to make the state free from open defecation, he said. mentioning the challenge of rising population, he said all possible avenues should be explored to find the resources for urban development. highlighting the importance of the housing scheme, the prime minister observed that, “a house was a turning point in the lives of poor, which leads towards a better life and the government’s effort was to not just provide a house, but to provide the right environment to live life to the fullest.” citing the existing housing shortage of 2 crore units, he said india would complete 75 years of independence in 2022, and by then, it was “our responsibility to provide a house for everyone”. noting that public representatives and leaders are remembered by the good work they did in their terms, the prime minister asked urban leaders to contribute to doing something for the good of the people. if a person gets an opportunity and does something worthwhile, it will be remembered even after 50 years, he said. asking chairpersons of municipalities and mayors of urban local bodies to do some good work in their terms, modi said, “you can show your grandson whether it is any building or whatever you have done 50 years ago. the success parameter of life is that what you have done for the people.” the prime minister appreciated people for their interest and work in the swachh bharat initiative, as well as the positive role played by media in generating awareness. “all media men are doing it on their own and media role in swachh bharat campaign will always be remembered for this, he said. on the rural and urban divide, the prime minister said urban and rural development in the country should be complimentary. “one way of doing this was to ensure waste water management in urban areas, so that the treated water could be returned to rural areas for irrigation. similarly solid waste management could generate compost which could act as organic fertiliser for the surrounding rural areas,” he said. chief minister of maharashtra devendra fadnavis, haryana cm manohar lal khattar, jammu and kashmir deputy cm nirmal kumar singh, mayors, chairpersons of urban local bodies and senior officials from all states and uts have attended the mega event at the vigyan bhawan. on the occasion, the prime minister released logos, and taglines for amrut and smart cities mission;

but he stopped short of announcing acceptance of the demand of ex-servicemen who are agitating for over last two months. wearing a printed orange-coloured turban and delivering probably the longest

corruption start-up india, stand up india should be our mantra: modi ; govt accepts orop in principle, says pm he mentioned the announcements made during his first independence day address last year like swachh bharat and jandhan schemes and said many of them had been implemented in a time-bound manner like building of toilets. the government programmes are focused on welfare of the poor and other underprivileged sections while ensuring reduction in inflation and efforts to boost growth to double digit, he said. while talking about efforts for development, modi made a strong pitch for communal harmony and peace. “the world keeps signing praise about india’s diversity and greatness. like diversity, the country also has simplicity and unity, which are our capital. these have been nurtured over the centuries. this capital has to be preserved,” he said. “be it the poison of casteism or the frenzy of communalism, these have no place in the country and should not be allowed to grow. these ills have to be eradicated through the nectar of development,” he said. he said if the unity of india is destroyed, then the “dreams” of the people will also be shattered as the country looking forward to development and progress. modi, in his second independence day address, focused largely on the issue of corruption and asserted that the steps taken by his government over the last 15 months to deal with this “termite” had started yielding results. responding to opposition criticism that nothing is happening on dealing with the problem of black money, he said “some people love to spread pessimism” as he informed that about rs 6,500 crore of undeclared money has been disclosed during the compliance window provided by the government. asserting that there is no allegation of even one paisa corruption against his 15-month-old government, he pledged to free the country from this malaise “braving all kinds of attacks” and ridiculed those questioning this endeavour. responding to opposition criticism on dealing with corruption and black money, modi said, “some people love to spread pessimism. it is like an addiction. they cannot get sleep without it. for them, there is no meaning for programmes and initiatives. they keep on saying that nothing is happening, nothing is visible”. though he did not name anybody, his remarks assume significance as rahul gandhi had only last week in parliament questioned what had been done on dealing with black money. “there is a lot of talk in our country about corruption. “it is like a sick person giving suggestions to others on how to remain healthy, there are people who are themselves corrupt, who give suggestions on how to deal with corruption,” the prime minister said. “giving suggestions to each other is also an art. i want to give an account today...we have not shown our commitment to fight corruption by addressing press conferences. we are working on the ground. we have shown results,” he said. he said corruption had become a part of the system and “contractors were running the nation”. noting that his government had taken steps to correct the system, he said corruption has to be “severed from the system” and it has to start from the top. he said the “termite” had spread wide and deep but nobody took any action against it over the last 60 years and it is only his government which started dealing with it. mentioning the new act on black money, he said people have been complaining that it is “too tough” a law. “we have received messages that the law is too tough and it should be diluted,” he said, without naming anybody. he spoke about a number of initiatives to end corruption and bring transparency and proposed doing away with the practice interviews for small jobs, contending that this becomes a route for corruption. “one form of corruption is through jobs... why should there be interview? i am yet to come across any psychologist who can assess anybody in two minutes (of interview). i have to stop this ‘bimari’ (practice)... let us end the requirement of an interview for small jobs immediately,” he said, adding that he would make a request to states also in this regard. referring to the much-anticipated orop, he said the government has “in-principle accepted” it and he was hopeful of a positive outcome of the ongoing discussions which are in the “last stage”. in his first independence day speech from red fort last year, he had announced a number of significant decisions and schemes like disbanding the planning commission and launch of swachh bharat and jandhan schemes. “all governments make programmes but what matters is implementation,” he said. talking about steps to deal with corruption and bring about transparency, he mentioned initiatives like direct benefit transfer for lpg, ‘give it up’ campaign for gas subsidy, jandhan and auction of precious resources like coal, spectrum and radio fm channels. he referred to coal block auction and said the national exchequer will get rs 3 lakh crore through it. “when i mention coal, i appeal to political pundits not to view it politically. when cag said there was a loss of rs 1.76 lakh crore, the amount seemed stupendous. but when we went through the auction route, we saw that rs 3 lakh crore will go to the national exchequer,” modi said. he also talked about auctioning of spectrum for telecom purposes. in this context, he mentioned the auctioning of fm radio channels. “a lot of pressure was put on me. questions were asked as to why radio channels are being auctioned as they cater to the common people. but i was firm as india wants transparency. auction in 80-85 cities has yielded over rs 1,000 crore,” he said. talking about efforts for financial inclusion of the poor and marginalised people, he said the time-bound implementation of jandhan scheme announced by him in last independence day address saw 17 crore bank accounts being opened with overall deposit of rs 20,000 crore. “all our programmes and institutions should be helpful to the poor. we have to empower them through financial inclusion,” he said. referring to his pet clean india initiative, modi said almost 4.25 lakh toilets were built in 2.62 lakh schools nationwide since the announcement of the scheme on this day last year. “swachh bharat campaign is the most important initiative of 1.25 crore people of team india with contributions by all—from celebrities to politicians, to teachers, spiritual leaders and the media. the children proved to be the biggest brand ambassadors of the campaign,” he said. the prime minister said the biggest tribute to mahatma gandhi would be a ‘clean india’ by 2019, the sesquicentennial year of the father of the nation. modi said as part of his government’s efforts to recognize dignity of labour, it was decided to give identity cards to those working in unorganised sectors. “rs 27,000 crore of their money was lying with the government. with the introduction of i cards for them, their money will go with them wherever they go,” he said, adding “dignity of labour is our national duty...it should be part of our nature”. referring to the efficacy of direct benefit transfer with regard to lpg subsidy, he said rs 15,000 crore was being transferred annually to the accounts of the beneficiaries which eliminated the “brokers and middlemen” from the system. “rs 15,000 crore that used to be swindled in the name of lpg subsidy was stopped. is it not a way to fight corruption?” he said. — pti","pm modi makes strong pitch communal harmony , focuses

2015-09-20,pm says will receive netaji's family next month; silent on files,"new delhi, september 20 prime minister narendra modi today said he would be receiving family members of netaji subhas chandra bose next month but avoided any reference to declassification of secret files related to him which is being demanded by various sections after west bengal government did so. in his 12th edition of monthly radio programme, ‘mann ki baat’, modi spoke about a number of issues, including those he had highlighted during the previous episodes like giving up of lpg subsidy, swacch bharat campaign, promotion of khadi besides pushing for greater voter participation and paying tributes to soldiers on the 50th anniversary of the 1965 india-pak war. during the 30-minute programme, he recalled that in may he had met some family members of subhas chandra bose during a visit to kolkata. “i got an opportunity to spend some time with them. that day it was decided that the extended family of subhas babu will visit the prime minister’s residence.... last week, i got confirmation that over 50 members of subhas babu' s family are coming to visit the prime minister’s residence,” modi said. “over 50 members of subhas babu’s family, from various countries, will be coming...i am happy to welcome them,” he said. ; describing it as a momentous occasion for him, modi said the family members of netaji, perhaps for the first time, would be together visiting the prime minister’s residence. “but the bigger happiness is for me as nobody in the prime minister’s residence would have got such a chance earlier as i will be getting in october.” while making the reference to bose, the prime minister made no mention of the issue of declassification of secret files related to the freedom fighter. after west bengal government declassified 64 such files a few days back, chief minister mamata banerjee and some others have demanded that the central government also should declassify the files that are with the pmo and home ministry. in the programme, suggestions and questions from various callers, including that by a child, were also aired. to a suggestion on greater enrolment of youth as voters, the prime minister emphasised that it was essential for everybody to register as voters. he also pitched for raising the voting percentage by exhorting more and more people to exercise their franchise. he patted the election commission for making efforts to create awareness among the voters about their rights. “earlier, the election commission used to be just a regulator. but over the last few years, the election commission has been instrumental in bringing about a change in the mindset of voters. it is now not only a regulator but also a facilitator,” he said. at the same time, modi said that the task of creating awareness should not be left to the election commission only but others should also contribute. he also mentioned his slogan, “pehle matdaan, phir jalpaan (first vote, then eat).” he also hailed radio, saying it is a great medium for communication which he had been using over the last one year to reach out to people through ‘mann ki baat’ (straight from the heart), which he said had become ‘aap ki baat (your talk)’. in this context, he mentioned that the great freedom fighter subhas chandra bose had set up radio in germany and he would communicate through it in various languages. talking about the upcoming gandhi jayanti, modi again exhorted people to buy at least one khadi clothing and a handloom product as a tribute to mahatma gandhi and to encourage the industry. the prime minister, who had started the ‘mann ki baat’ programme on gandhi jayanti last year, recalled that he had made the same appeal at that time and it had resulted in doubling of sales of khadi products in one year. the child, who did not give out his name, told modi that since he had initiated the ‘swacch bharat’ campaign, there should be dustbins in every lane of the country. agreeing with this, the prime minister said cleanliness should be made a habit and provisions made for cleanliness. expressing happiness that cleanliness is being discussed from parliament to the streets, he said the campaign will have to be carried forward “despite its weaknesses” so that the dream of mahatma gandhi to see india a clean country is realised by 2019, the 150th birth anniversary of the father of the nation. “from this boy’s suggestion, i get big satisfaction. i had announced the swachh bharat campaign on october 2 (last year) and it must be for the first time since independence that discussions are held in parliament for hours on cleanliness. our government is also criticised. i also have to hear a lot that ‘modi had talked big on cleanliness, but did anything happen’? i do not mind it. i see it positively that parliament too is discussing about cleanliness,” he said. the prime minister also referred to the 1965 war in the context of his visit to a defence exhibition on it here few days ago. describing it as “educative”, he hailed the armed forces for their valour and sacrifices as he mentioned that during the exhibition he met some of those who had participated in the war. “if you want to create history, then it is essential to understand the minute aspects of history. history keeps us connected to our roots. if connection with history breaks, then attempts to make history also come to a halt,” he said. talking about lpg subsidy, he said 30 lakh people have given it up after his ‘give-up’ call and most importantly, many of them are not rich people. “is this not a silent revolution? is not reflective of people’s power? governments also should learn that beyond the realms of government, there is a big capable, energetic and committed society. the more the governments remain connected to the society, the more it can work as a catalyst to bring changes in the society,” modi said. talking about his experience of ‘mann ki baat’ on completion of its one year, he said his confidence on people had turned into conviction. he said when he decided to have a new experiment of getting phone in calls from people with suggestions in this episode, 55,000 calls were received from all over the country out of which only a few were selected for airing. a caller from rajasthan suggested that during the upcoming diwali, people should use ‘deep’ made of earthen material, to which modi agreed, saying it will benefit environment. — pti",pm says receive netaji ' family next month ; silent files,"new delhi , september 20 prime minister narendra modi today said would receiving family members netaji subhas chandra bose next month avoided reference declassification secret files related demanded various sections west bengal government so. 12th edition monthly radio programme , ‘mann ki baat ’ , modi spoke number issues , including highlighted previous episodes like giving lpg subsidy , swacch bharat campaign , promotion khadi besides pushing greater voter participation paying tributes soldiers 50th anniversary 1965 india-pak war. 30-minute programme , recalled may met family members subhas chandra bose visit kolkata. “i got opportunity spend time them. day decided extended family subhas babu visit prime minister ’ residence .... last week , got confirmation 50 members subhas babu ' family coming visit prime minister ’ residence , ” modi said. “over 50 members subhas babu ’ family , various countries , coming ... happy welcome , ” said. ; describing momentous occasion , modi said family members netaji , perhaps first time , would together visiting prime minister ’ residence. “but bigger happiness nobody prime minister ’ residence would got chance earlier getting october. ” making reference bose , prime minister made mention issue declassification secret files related freedom fighter. west bengal government declassified 64 files days back , chief minister mamata banerjee others demanded central government also declassify files pmo home ministry. programme , suggestions questions various callers , including child , also aired. suggestion greater enrolment youth voters , prime minister emphasised essential everybody register voters. also pitched raising voting percentage exhorting people exercise franchise. patted election commission making efforts create awareness among voters rights. “earlier , election commission used regulator. last years , election commission instrumental bringing change mindset voters. regulator also facilitator , ” said. time , modi said task creating awareness left election commission others also contribute. also mentioned slogan , “pehle matdaan , phir jalpaan ( first vote , eat ) . ” also hailed radio , saying great medium communication using last one year reach people ‘mann ki baat ’ ( straight heart ) , said become ‘aap ki baat ( talk ) ’ . context , mentioned great freedom fighter subhas chandra bose set radio germany would communicate various languages. talking upcoming gandhi jayanti , modi exhorted people buy least one khadi clothing handloom product tribute mahatma gandhi encourage industry. prime minister , started ‘mann ki baat ’ programme gandhi jayanti last year , recalled made appeal time resulted doubling sales khadi products one year. child , give name , told modi since initiated ‘swacch bharat ’ campaign , dustbins every lane country. agreeing , prime minister said cleanliness made habit provisions made cleanliness. expressing happiness cleanliness discussed parliament streets , said campaign carried forward “despite weaknesses ” dream mahatma gandhi see india clean country realised 2019 , 150th birth anniversary father nation. “from boy ’ suggestion , get big satisfaction. announced swachh bharat campaign october 2 ( last year ) must first time since independence discussions held parliament hours cleanliness. government also criticised. also hear lot ‘modi talked big cleanliness , anything happen ’ ?

2015-11-26,rajnath attacks congress on secularism,"new delhi, november 26 home minister rajnath singh on thursday launched a scathing attack on the congress on the issue of secularism, saying it was the “most misused” term in the country which has led to tension in society. initiating discussion on ‘commitment to india’s constitution as part of 125th birth anniversary of b.r. ambedkar, the home minister said in the lok sabha that the architect of the constitution had never thought of putting the term secularism in the preamble but it was incorporated through an amendment in 1976. “the words ‘socialist’ and ‘secular’ were incorporated in the preamble through the 42nd amendment of the constitution. we have no objection. let bygone be bygone. b.r. ambedkar had never thought the necessity to incorporate it in the preamble as these two words were part of the constitution. “it is inbuilt in the indian system,” he said amidst protests from congress. countering his contention, congress leader in the lok sabha mallikarjun kharge objected to the home minister’s remarks and said ambedkar was also in favour of putting the word in the preamble but could not do so due to the prevailing situation then. ; singh objected to the use of hindi word ‘dharma nirpekshta’, saying the literal translation of the secularism should be ‘panth nirpekshta’ and it should be regularly used as it is the official hindi translation of secularism. “secularism is the most misused word in the country. its misuse should come to an end. because of the rampant misuse of the word, there have been instances of tension in the society,” he said in the presence of prime minister narendra modi, congress chief sonia gandhi besides others. the home minister said it was difficult to maintain social harmony because of the “rampant misuse” of the word 'secularism'. he said the issue of reservation has been politicised, and made it clear that quota was a constitutional provision and there was “no scope” for any further debate on the issue. “reservation is a socio-political necessity. hence, there is a constitutional provision for it,” he said. the remarks came weeks after rss chief mohan bhagwat supported a review of the reservation system in the country. top bjp leaders, during the bihar assembly poll, repeatedly assured that the government would not do away with the present quota system. asserting modi government’s commitment for safety and security of every indian, irrespective of caste, creed or religion, singh said everyone born in india is indian and all are brothers. he said india was the only country where all 72 sects of muslims lived and communities like zoroastrian and jews felt safe while facing persecution elsewhere. besides paying glowing tributes to ambedkar, the home minister remembered the contribution of late prime minister jawaharlal nehru and late home minister sardar vallabh bhai patel in nation building. singh termed lord ram as the greatest democrat saying he ordered his wife sita to go ‘agni pariksha’ after someone raised the issue. the home minister said the prime minister was inspired by the philosophy of ambedkar and constitution and launched schemes like ‘jan dhan yojana’, ‘swachh bharat abhiyan’, ‘beti badhao, beti padho’. his remarks linking the projects with ambedkar’s vision invited strong reactions and jibes from opposition benches. when singh said the government is working for reservation of 33 per cent jobs for women in paramilitary and state police forces, a member from the congress asked why the modi government was delaying the constitution amendment bill to provide for one-third reservation for women in the lok sabha and state assemblies. in his tributes to ambedkar, the home minister said he was also the brain behind the establishment of the reserve bank of india, finance commission and several waterways projects across the country. — pti",rajnath attacks congress secularism,"new delhi , november 26 home minister rajnath singh thursday launched scathing attack congress issue secularism , saying “most misused ” term country led tension society. initiating discussion ‘commitment india ’ constitution part 125th birth anniversary b.r. ambedkar , home minister said lok sabha architect constitution never thought putting term secularism preamble incorporated amendment 1976. “the words ‘socialist ’ ‘secular ’ incorporated preamble 42nd amendment constitution. objection. let bygone bygone. b.r. ambedkar never thought necessity incorporate preamble two words part constitution. “it inbuilt indian system , ” said amidst protests congress. countering contention , congress leader lok sabha mallikarjun kharge objected home minister ’ remarks said ambedkar also favour putting word preamble could due prevailing situation then. ;

2015-11-26,opposition parties raise ‘intolerance’ issue in ls,"new delhi, november 26 opposition parties today raised in lok sabha the issue of 'intolerance', saying the untoward incidents witnessed in the recent past should be condemned as they send out ""negative messages"" and asked prime minister narendra modi to address the matter. participating in a debate on the 'commitment to the constitution', trinamool congress leader sudip bandyopadhyay said every incident of intolerance should be condemned and that it should be looked at as to why dignified artistes, including aamir khan, are feeling uneasy in their own country. few incidents of intolerance are sending ""negative messages"" and the prime minister should rise to the occasion in addressing the issue, he said. ""we should look at why artistes like shah rukh khan, aamir khan, ar rahman... are feeling uneasy in our own country? why are they saying so,"" he said during the debate being held as part of 125th birth anniversary celebrations of b r ambedkar. wondering why these people are facing such a situation, bandopadhyay said the issue should be taken up on priority. ; his remarks come against the backdrop of various artistes -- including cine star aamir khan -- finding themselves in the eye of a storm over their remarks on intolerance. ""why sometimes we find incidents of intolerance happening?.... intolerance from every corner should be condemned,"" the tmc member said. the prime minister has spoken against such incidents but he did not do it in the country but abroad, he said, adding when the prime minister rises to the occasion, it would give a positive signal to the country. modi was in the house. underlining that india is a tolerant country, bandyopadhyay said when incidents of intolerance happen, then the responsibility falls on the shoulders of the government. ""we (the house) should firmly, in a united voice, protest against such incidents... we should not hesitate to raise our voice,"" the tmc leader said. bjd's tathagata satpathy said incidents of intolerance should not be tolerated.

""how can the centre be strengthened if states are weak?"" he wondered. referring to the home minister rajnath singh's remarks about secularism, bandyopadhyay said that nobody should oppose secularism and ""he (singh) should not criticise the existing constitution"". talking about articles in the constitution on minority protection and prohibition of untouchability, bandyopadhyay said eradicating ""discriminatory attitude"" would be a befitting thing for ambedkar. bandyopadhyay said there is scope for amendments and about 100 amendments to constitution have been made so far. satpathy said that going by the way the centre is functioning, the federal structure is not given attention. taking a dig at the government's decision to impose cess for swachh bharat, the bjd member said no tax was slapped on people for cleanliness drive in his home state odisha. satpathy also wondered how the word secularism, when translated into hindi, becomes a ""perverted"" word while referring to home minister's remarks earlier. ""just because we don't speak hindi does not mean we are not indians,"" the bjd leader noted. about freedom of expression, satpathy said there have been instances of internet being blocked during protests in gujarat and misuse of a provision in the information technology act in maharashtra.

""people who made him chairman of the drafting committee themselves put up candidates to oppose ambedkar in two elections which he contested from mumbai. and the result was babasaheb ambedkar lost both the times,"" adsul added. k rammohan naidu (tdp) said the constitution acted as a unifying factor amidst the diversity of india.

2015-11-27,"rajnath counters ‘intolerance’, says cong misused secularism","aditi tandon  new delhi, november 26 political bickering and one-upmanship dominated the debate on “commitment to the constitution” in the lok sabha today. the government blamed the current fears around intolerance on the alleged misuse of the term “secular” and the opposition attacking the ruling bjp for “jeopardising” the fundamentals of the constitution. moments after prime minister narendra modi indicated a willingness to discuss anything, the government and the congress had a face-off in the house, which debated the contribution of dr br ambedkar to mark the day the constituent assembly in 1949 adopted the constitution he chiefly drafted. home minister rajnath singh, speaking for the government, accused the opposition of “abusing the word secularism and called for a moratorium on its use”. ; congress president sonia gandhi raked the issue of intolerance to say past instances (return of awards by scholars and lynching of a muslim in dadri) had “betrayed the ideals of the constitution”. she even jibed the bjp saying “it’s the biggest mockery that those who have no faith in the constitution and have had no role in its drafting are now championing its cause”. the congress leader firmly laid a claim to ambedkar’s legacy saying it was her party that trusted the late leader to head the constitution drafting committee. she then invoked ambedkar to say the congress had a right over the constitution, which was linked to its history. earlier, the prime minister said parliament was the best place for a dialogue. “i hope all mps live up to the expectations of people,” he said. initiating the two-day debate in the lok sabha as part of the government’s 125th birth anniversary celebrations of ambedkar, rajnath questioned the inclusion of words “socialist and secular” in the preamble of the constitution saying the founding fathers were against such alterations. former prime minister indira gandhi’s government had brought the 42nd amendment to insert these words. “today secularism is the most abused word. this abuse should stop as it abets communal tension. we should instead use the term to mean ‘class neutral’ instead of ‘religion neutral’. even the constitution framers didn’t include the word secular in the preamble because they knew our religion was intrinsically secular and didn't consider a separate mention essential. though the constitution makers were against changes to the preamble, the 42nd amendment was brought and “secular and socialist” inserted. that’s not to say we are against these ideals. we only want their abuse to stop,” said rajnath, sparking fiery protests on the opposition benches with cpm’s mohd salim, trinamool’s kalyan banerjee and congress’ mallikarjun kharge objecting to his statement. amid the prime minister’s presence (he sat throughout the daylong debate), the home minister clarified the government's stand on quota after the furore created by rss chief mohan bhagwat’s “review the reservation” remark. “some people are politicising the issue of reservation. there is no room for discussion on this. the reservation was provided as a socio-political necessity and there’s no question of diluting it,” said rajnath. the minister took swipes at congress vice-president rahul gandhi for his anti-swachh bharat tirade in bengaluru yesterday and actor aamir khan for publicly sharing his wife’s “let’s leave india” statement. to counter aamir, he invoked ambedkar: “dr ambedkar suffered a lot of harassment during his life but never spoke of leaving india and settling in some country. he absorbed insult and advanced the image of india.” the statements triggered angry response from kharge: “we and ambedkar are original inhabitants of india. you and aryans are outsiders.” as the bjp members cried insult, speaker sumitra mahajan, who earlier introduced today's topic of debate comprehensively, promised the house to review ""aryans are not indians"" comment. later in the day, accusations of intolerance were heaped on the government by kharge, trinamool’s sudeep bandopadhyay, ncp's tariq

2015-12-04,"cea panel on gst for 17-18% rate, dropping of 1% additional levy","new delhi, december 4 in a recommendation that can break the political logjam over the gst, a panel headed by the chief economic adviser on friday suggested a 17-18 per cent gst rate and dropping of the 1 per cent additional tax on inter-state sales. the arvind subramanian-headed panel, however, opposed the inclusion of gst rate in the constitution. the congress has been demanding the gst rate be included in the constitution. describing the gst as a historic opportunity to “make in india by making one india”, the panel has recommended a range for revenue-neutral rate (rnr) of 15-15.5 per cent for the proposed goods and services tax (gst), with a preference for the lower one. it also suggested a range of ‘standard’ tax rate of 17-18 per cent for bulk of goods and services, while recommending 12 per cent for ‘low rate goods’ and 40 per cent for demerit goods like luxury car, aerated beverages, pan masala and tobacco. for precious metal, it recommended a range of 2-6 per cent. while subramanian at the press meet said the recommended standard rate is 17-18 per cent, an executive summary of the report released alongside suggested the rate to be between 16.9-18.9 per cent in a tabular form. the summary in narration, however, put the rate at 17-18 per cent. ; also, the panel recommended early inclusion of alcohol and petroleum products in the gst. “bringing alcohol and real estate within the scope of the gst would further the government’s objectives of improving governance and reducing black money generation without compromising on states’ fiscal autonomy,” said the report, which was submitted to finance minister arun jaitley today. the recommendations seem to suggest a middle-path approach in the deadlock between the congress and the government, which didn’t want the gst rate to be part of the bill as it would require a two-third majority approval of parliament for any change in rates for any product in future. the government wants the gst bill to be approved in the current session of parliament to meet the april 1, 2016, rollout deadline. “this historic opportunity of cleaning up the tax system is not just necessary in itself, but also to support gst rates that facilitate rather than burden compliance,” the report added. our stand on gst remains same: cong there is no major forward movement on the gst issue, even a week after prime minister narendra modi reached out to congress president sonia gandhi and former pm manmohan singh to resolve the matter, the congress indicated on friday. “i do not think the congress has moved away from the stand stated at the meeting with the prime minister ... our stand remains the same,” congress spokesperson sushmita dev told reporters. besides, she said, “brainstorming is on” within the congress on the concerns conveyed to the party leadership by the government. dev slammed the government for its plan to impose 2 per cent cess for the ‘skill india’ mission, thereby taking the total to five per cent for different purposes including swachh bharat abhiyan. “today we heard an alarming new policy proposition, which will be another burden on common man. why is common man being burdened for pm’s pet projects — make in india, skill india, swachh bharat. how much more burden will the government put? “in light of this, our fears on the gst bill are accurate. “there has to be a cap of 18 per cent. otherwise it’ll be difficult for people to cope with it,” she said. she also hoped that government would roll back the additional one per cent cess brought to compensate the manufacturing states. besides, she faulted the government for bringing the gst bill to the rajya sabha soon after its passage in the lok sabha without holding any discussion with the opposition. “this does not amount to good consensus politics,” she said. last friday, the prime minister had reached out to the congress keeping hopes alive for the enactment of the goods and services tax bill before the beginning of the next financial year. the 45-minute meeting at 7, race course road had not resulted in an immediate breakthrough, but it did serve to break the ice between the government and the congress, with the latter consistently alleging that the ruling party was riding roughshod over the opposition in parliament. — pti","cea panel gst 17-18 % rate , dropping 1 % additional levy","new delhi , december 4 recommendation break political logjam gst , panel headed chief economic adviser friday suggested 17-18 per cent gst rate dropping 1 per cent additional tax inter-state sales. arvind subramanian-headed panel , however , opposed inclusion gst rate constitution. congress demanding gst rate included constitution. describing gst historic opportunity “make india making one india ” , panel recommended range revenue-neutral rate ( rnr ) 15-15.5 per cent proposed goods services tax ( gst ) , preference lower one. also suggested range ‘standard ’ tax rate 17-18 per cent bulk goods services , recommending 12 per cent ‘low rate goods ’ 40 per cent demerit goods like luxury car , aerated beverages , pan masala tobacco. precious metal , recommended range 2-6 per cent. subramanian press meet said recommended standard rate 17-18 per cent , executive summary report released alongside suggested rate 16.9-18.9 per cent tabular form. summary narration , however , put rate 17-18 per cent. ; also , panel recommended early inclusion alcohol petroleum products gst. “bringing alcohol real estate within scope gst would government ’ objectives improving governance reducing black money generation without compromising states ’ fiscal autonomy , ” said report , submitted finance minister arun jaitley today. recommendations seem suggest middle-path approach deadlock congress government , ’ want gst rate part bill would require two-third majority approval parliament change rates product future. government wants gst bill approved current session parliament meet april 1 , 2016 , rollout deadline. “this historic opportunity cleaning tax system necessary , also support gst rates facilitate rather burden compliance , ” report added. stand gst remains : cong major forward movement gst issue , even week prime minister narendra modi reached congress president sonia gandhi former pm manmohan singh resolve matter , congress indicated friday. “i think congress moved away stand stated meeting prime minister ... stand remains , ” congress spokesperson sushmita dev told reporters. besides , said , “brainstorming ” within congress concerns conveyed party leadership government. dev slammed government plan impose 2 per cent cess ‘skill india ’ mission , thereby taking total five per cent different purposes including swachh bharat abhiyan. “today heard alarming new policy proposition , another burden common man. common man burdened pm ’ pet projects — make india , skill india , swachh bharat. much burden government put ?

2016-02-24,rail budget: prabhu on tightrope walk to balance finances with aspirations,"new delhi, february 24 railway minister suresh prabhu faces a stiff dilemma on whether to raise fares and freight rates in his second rail budget tomorrow as railway finances come under tremendous strain. while the falling revenue collection and increasing demand for funding various capacity augmentation projects as well as the requirement for improving passenger services demand hiking up fares, a section in railway ministry does not favour any such move, saying an increase at this juncture will not be a very good idea as elections are round the corner in four states and diesel price is on the downslide. “diesel price is on the decline. passenger bookings and goods loadings are also on downslide. so at this moment hiking freight rate and passenger fares will affect the railways adversely,” sources in railways said, adding “fare hike can be effected anytime after budget also, if required and it is not necessary that it has to be done only in the budget.” besides, prabhu will also have to take call on whether to impose safety cess for strengthening safety measures to prevent accidents. ; however, railways have already decided to run as many special trains on higher fares in popular routes catering to the growing demand during festive season, an indirect way of hiking fares. upgradation of existing coaches with modern facilities and improved interiors are being planned in a big way to run trains on higher fares like the recently launched mahamana express between new delhi and varanasi. the cross-subsidy from freight to passenger operation has crossed rs 30,000 cr this year, while the seventh pay commission burden is about rs 32,000 cr. the railways have earned rs 136,079.26 crore as against the target of rs 141,416.05 crore during april-january period, a decline of 3.77 per cent. the railways had effected a 14 per cent across-the-board hike in passenger fares in 2014 during the nda regime and a 10 per cent increase last year. however, despite the grim economic condition, the railway budget is expected to focus on massive capacity creation in the rail sector with an increased plan outlay of about rs 1.25 lakh crore. a significant amount will be earmarked for safety upgradation, electrification, doubling and modernisation of yards to clear traffic bottlenecks, the sources said. it appears that prabhu will have to depend mostly on the external budgetary resources (ebr) for execution of the capacity augmentation projects and he will give details of his resource mobilisation plan in the rail budget 2016-17. since gross budgetary support (gbs) from the finance ministry is unlikley to meet the railways’ expectation, funding of projects will be mostly from ebr. while annoucement of new trains is unlikely for the second consecutive year, new service will be launched selectively to cater to the local requirement and demands. aiming at shifting goods from road to rail, the budget will offer various schemes to attract loadings. a scheme for premium high-speed parcel trains is slated to be unveiled in the budget. in suburban section, the rail budget will announce introduction of ac suburban trains in mumbai, which will be replicated in other areas as well. the fare of ac suburban service will be higher than regular local train. introduction of dual mode engine to enable the train to run both on diesel and electricity is likley to be announced in the budget. prabhu will give details about the concerted efforts being undertaken by the railways to keep stations and trains clean and environment-friendly in his second budget speech in parliament on february 25. continuing with ‘swachh bharat’ drive, prabhu is also likely to announce plans for installation of bio-toilets and vacuum toilets in as many trains and placing dustbins in every coach. according to sources, since swachh cess is imposed on railways, there is a likelyhood of getting a portion of swachh fund for carry out cleaning exercise at rail premises. all 400 stations being planned to be developed with private participation are likely to be announced as “green stations” with several environment-friendly measures like generation of solar energy, recycling of water, conversion of waste to energy and use of led lights to be incorporated in the plan. targeting rail users and industry, prabhu will make some announcements promising better passenger amenities and incentivise freight business. the operating ratio (or) target of 88.5 per cent for 2015-16 seems to be unlikely and the minister will have to do a lot of balancing act to keep the or in control. aiming at zero-accident level, prabhu will announce various measures using technology such as equipping gang men with safety device and solar operated automatic warning system at unmanned level crossings to strengthen safety on tracks to prevent train mishaps. an action plan of an integration of various systems including track maintenance and signalling to develop a robust mechanism using information technology to curb mishaps is likely to be announced. plagued with catering complaints, prabhu will highlight the e-catering system to address the problem. on high speed, he will showcase the agreement with japan to execute india’s first proposed bullet train project on the mumbai-ahmedabad route. prabhu will also spell out plans to increase non-tariff revenue substantially through various routes including advertisements and commercialisation of surplus land. besides increasing revenue from advertisement substantially, railway is planning commercial exploitation of real estate through station development, parcel-leasing, export of railway equipment. expanding the use of it applications, prabhu is slated to announce launching of an online system to know the total earnings from passenger and freight besides the consumption of fuel on daily basis. focusing on information technology, the budget will highlight development modules to monitor rail temperature and bridge water level online as part of the track management system (tms) across the

""would you say there are long term benefits and the country would have to wait for those? or is there any way to mitigate the problem being faced by the country,"" he was asked. a more serious analysis, he argued, would show that even within matter of months there is a short term positive impact of all these projects. while demonetisation and gst are having desired impact in terms of tax compliances and squeezing the quantum of cash in the economy, he said that for the first time, 'swachh bharat' campaign has brought to fore the importance of cleanliness. before demonetisation, indian norm was to live with a high cash economy, not paying taxes, ""you buy a property, you transact partly in cash, and in business you maintain two sets of accounts,"" he said. ""how can a country, which aims to be the fastest growing major economy in the world, which aspires to grow from a developing to a developed economy, continue with the normal of this type,"" he asked. and therefore, ""you need to shake the system"" in order to reduce the quantum of cash in india and therefore obviously to make it a more tax complaint society, he observed. cash itself involves several challenges. it leads to corruption and several other problems, he added. ""let's see for even those why say that there is no short- term advantage, has the number of tax payers in india immediately increased in the matter of months? the truth is, it has. has the digitisation transaction increased from rs 70 crores to rs 130 crores today, it almost doubled,"" he said. in the immediate aftermath of demonetisation, jaitley said there has been sharp reduction in insurgent and terror activities in states like jammu & kashmir and chhattisgarh. the terror funding itself has gotten squeezed, he said. ""you are having terrorist incidents (now), but the fact that you were finding 5,000-10,000 stone throwers being provided with money by the terrorist organisations, why is it that in the last 8-10 months it has not happened?"" he asked. moving on to gst, the minister said this has resulted in creation of a national tax structure. ""in the three months, you have all the check points in states disappeared, you have clear flow of goods and services which has started all over the country,"" he said. jaitley said the gst council has noted some challenges and it is taking steps to address them. gst, he said, has been a ""reasonable smooth transformation,"" but there is scope for improvement. ""i think in gst council we have succeeded in creating india's first federal institution,"" he said. the transition, he said, would be a far more successful experience which will plug the holes into india's taxation system. responding to questions, jaitley said the indian government wants to encourage startups. ""the obvious challenge to the country is to grow and grow fast. it has to grow at a much higher rate than we have been growing in recent history,"" he said, adding that the benefits of the growth must also reach that section of the population which till date has been the least serviced one. observing that conventionally india was a far more difficult place to do business, he said that situation has substantially improved for the better. identifying corruption as one of the two stigmas for india, jaitley said the institutional mechanism to fight corruption has become much stronger. asserting that direct taxes have to become ""more rational and more reasonable"" jaitley said he has already announced a roadmap to bring down the corporate tax to about 25 per cent and is trying to ensure that india becomes a far more compliance society and also tax assessment is more technology driven rather than human interaction. — pti ","gst , demonetisation desired impact : jaitley","washington , october 8 finance minister arun jaitley said government ' initiatives like ' swachh bharat ' , goods services tax ( gst ) demonetisation desired impact , latter two resulting increasing tax compliance squeezing quantum cash economy. keynote address – via video conference -- berkeley india conference yesterday , jaitley said public support reforms undertaken governments day centre state levels.

2017-10-28,narendra modi calls for debate on internal democracy in parties," new delhi, october 28 prime minister narendra modi on saturday called for a debate on internal democracy in political parties, asserting that the growth of “true democratic spirit” within them is necessary for the country’s future. modi made these remarks in a brief speech to the media at a ‘diwali milan’ event at the bjp headquarters as he pointed out that funding to political parties is often debated but not their values, ideologies, internal democracy and how they give opportunities to the new generation of leaders. the country, he said, is not much aware of the practice of democracy within parties and the media should turn its attention to it, he said. “whether democratic values are a part of their (parties’) core values or not, should be debated widely....i believe the development of a true democratic spirit within political parties is necessary not only for the country’s future but also for democracy,” he said. ; (follow the tribune on facebook; and twitter @thetribunechd) though the prime minister made no reference to any rival party, his comments come against the backdrop of reports that the congress may elevate its vice president rahul gandhi as president in place of sonia gandhi. the bjp has often accused the congress of practising dynasty politics and juxtaposed that with the rise of its party workers to top echelons to project itself as a party with a difference. modi also acknowledged that there are many voices within the bjp as he noted that when it was a small organisation earlier or during the times of jana sangh, its forerunner, there used to be “ideological harmony” from its central leadership down to workers in the bottom rung. the party’s expansion might be a reason behind divergent views, he said. he also praised the media for its support to swachh bharat (clean india) project, saying it had spoken in one voice over the issue even if it might have been critical of the government over other matters. the media has joined the scheme in “mission mode”, he said, adding that the country had still a long way to go to achieve international standards of cleanliness but the campaign had built an atmosphere in its favour. on the occasion, the prime minister also made some light remarks recalling his initial days as a party office-bearer in its headquarters when at times he had to look for journalists and fondly remembered his regular interactions with the media. he said both the ruling party and the media might have expectations as well complaints from each other but they had to get along happily amid these differences. in his remarks, bjp chief amit shah noted that diwali marked the beginning of the new year in gujarat, a state from where he hailed, and said the country had met various challenges successfully during the last year and moved ahead under the modi government. “we are entering the new year with a lot of positivity,” he said. pti ",narendra modi calls debate internal democracy parties,"new delhi , october 28 prime minister narendra modi saturday called debate internal democracy political parties , asserting growth “true democratic spirit ” within necessary country ’ future. modi made remarks brief speech media ‘diwali milan ’ event bjp headquarters pointed funding political parties often debated values , ideologies , internal democracy give opportunities new generation leaders. country , said , much aware practice democracy within parties media turn attention , said. “whether democratic values part ( parties ’ ) core values , debated widely .... believe development true democratic spirit within political parties necessary country ’ future also democracy , ” said. ;

""in the last two weeks i have visited rural and urban areas, slums and settlement camps where undocumented population is residing... and i have found that these initiatives lack a more human rights approach,"" he said. a press release by the office of the high commissioner, united nations human rights, on the issue, which had a reference to mahatma gandhi, drew strong criticism from the government. the release was distributed at the press conference. ""everywhere i went, i saw the logo of the clean india mission- (mahatma) gandhi's glasses. in its third year of implementation, now is a critical time to replace the lens of those glasses with the human rights lens,"" heller was quoted as saying in the release. ; taking a strong note of his remarks on the logo of the clean india mission, the government issued a statement deploring that it showed ""serious insensitivity towards the father of the nation"". the statement said the world knows that the mahatma was the foremost proponent of human rights. ""instead of taking the human rights approach to sanitation in a holistic way, a piecemeal approach is there,"" heller told the press conference, and urged the government at all levels to impart a human rights perspective to its national programmes on safe drinking water and sanitation. heller today concluded his fortnight-long visit to the country during which he met several government officials and visited new delhi, kolkata, imphal, lucknow and mumbai where he also visted a few slums. the expert, charged by the un humans rights council, to monitor, report and advise on the realisation of the human rights to water and sanitation worldwide, said he also found that in certain areas people belonging to the scheduled castes and scheduled tribes faced ""discrimination"" in accessing toilets. eliminating open defecation is not just about building latrines, heller said. heller said he had a ""mixed perception"" about the mission which was a unique initiative of india and launched by the prime minister himself. ""on my last day in india, the website of clean india mission showed 53 million toilets built in the last years, in rural areas only, (besides in urban areas). i need to recognise that it is very impressive,"" he said. he also brought up the issue of the human rights of manual scavengers. ""the government's emphasis on building toilets should not involuntarily contribute to violating the fundamental rights of others, such as those specific caste groups enagaged in manual scavenging, or those who are marginalised such as ethnic minorities living in remote rural areas,"" he said. the government dismissed his preliminary findings as a ""rambling report"" and said it contained ""inaccuracies, sweeping generalisations and biases"".

""the certification procedure is not very straightforward. according to responsible ministries, the protocol to certify an odf area is not the same for rural and urban areas. i also learned that in some places, odf certified areas are not de facto open defecation free,"" he said. heller said the information, education and communication (iec) mechanism used for the mission lacked proper methodology. he said just a few workshops and events were not enough for effective implementation of the mission and that sustained efforts needed to be made. ""just dedicating funds is not enough. it is good the government has earmarked dedicated funds for the mission, but proper implementation through iec is needed,"" he added. the un expert also said both sanitation and provision of safe drinking water should be accorded equal priority. pti","un expert finds holes ' swachh bharat mission ' , gets panned","new delhi , november 10 prime minister narendra modi ' pet ' swachh bharat ' mission friday came sharp criticism top un expert sanitation said "" lacked holistic human rights approach "" , drawing swift reproval government. government also took exception united nation ' special rapporteur human rights safe drinking water sanitation leo heller ' reference mahatma gandhi ' spectacles mission ' logo , "" rambling "" report containing "" inaccuracies , sweeping generalisations biases "" .

2017-11-24,new train toilets no better than septic tanks: iit-m,"srinand jha a new kind of toilet using bacteria to break down human excreta has been deployed in indian trains over four years to 2017, at a cost of rs 1,305 crore, but this toilet is no better than a septic tank, the indian institute of technology-madras (iit-m) has concluded after a two-year study. as many as 93,537 “bio-digesters”, as the toilets are called, have been installed in mainline express and mail trains. these are small-scale sewage-treatment systems beneath the toilet seat: bacteria in a compost chamber digests human excreta, leaving behind water and methane. only the water, disinfected later, is let out on the tracks. however, sanitation experts and various studies, including those commissioned by the railways, have pointed out that most of the new “bio-toilets” are ineffective or ill maintained and the water discharged is no better than raw sewage. “our tests have found that the organic matter (human waste) collecting in the bio-digesters does not undergo any kind of treatment,” iit professor ligy philip, who headed the latest study, said. “like in the septic tanks, these bio-digesters accumulate slush (human excreta mixed with water).” the iit-m study was sponsored by the bill and melinda gates foundation and submitted last week to the union ministry of urban affairs. ; despite the criticism, an additional 120,000 coaches are to be fitted with these bio-toilets, jointly developed by the defence research and development organisation (drdo) and the indian railways, by december 2018. this is likely to cost rs 1,200 crore, the railways revealed on november 2, in response to a rti request. the bio-digester project began during the previous upa regime, but has been speeded up under prime minister narendra modi’s swachh bharat campaign. the idea is to meet this target in time for the celebration of mahatma gandhi’s 150th birth anniversary in 2019, said railway ministry spokesperson anil kumar saxena. indian railways are often described as the world’s biggest toilet: it ejects around 3,980 tonnes of faecal matter — the equivalent of 497 truckloads — onto rail tracks every day, according to a report released by the comptroller and auditor general (cag) in 2013. since 1993, the indian railways have been experimenting with a host of technologies to replace the open discharge system. this included vacuum toilets based on suction, commonly seen in aircraft;

the survey document for this year comes in pink colour, which highlights gender issues against the backdrop of development. the survey has highlighted that against the emerging macro-economic concerns, policy vigilance will be necessary in the coming year, especially if high international oil prices persist or elevated stock prices correct sharply, provoking a “sudden stall” in capital flows. on the agenda for the next year, the survey has listed supporting agriculture, stabilising the gst, completing the twin balance sheet (tbs) actions, privatising air india, and staving off threats to macro-economic stability. calling for the need to revive investments rather than savings, the survey seeks to achieve economic growth on the strength of the only two truly sustainable engines — private investment and exports. the survey has also called for utmost priority to social infrastructure like education, health and social protection to engineer an inclusive and sustainable growth. it has called for timely dispute resolution, including tax litigation. all these pointers in the survey indicate that the budget is likely to focus on these areas in the final year before the 2019 general election. chief economic adviser arvind subramanian said there has been a boost in registered direct and indirect taxpayers. this includes a 50 per cent increase in unique indirect taxpayers under the gst compared to the pre-gst system and an addition of about 1.8 million individual income tax filers since demonetisation in november 2016. the survey noted that the sum of all government efforts increased income tax collections, thus far, between rs 65,000 and rs 90,000 crore. these numbers imply a substantial increase in reported incomes (and hence in formalisation) of about 1.5 per cent to 2.3 per cent of the gdp. girish vanvari, national head of tax, kpmg (india), said it will be interesting to note how the government responds to the popular expectations of lower tax rates at individual and corporate tax levels especially in the light of an increasing tax base post gst and demonetisation. among the big novel ideas mooted in the survey is the “technology of gst council”. subramanian said the gst council is akin to “technology of reform”, the principle needs to be applied for reform in many other areas. for example, the “cooperative federalism technology” of the gst council could be used to create a common agricultural market, integrate fragmented and inefficient electricity markets, solve interstate water disputes, implement direct benefit transfers (dbt), make access to social benefits portable across states, and combat air pollution. fiscal indicators and forecast inflation average retail inflation declined to six-year low of 3.3 per cent in 2017-18, with the economy moving towards a more stable price regime tax disputes separate hc benches recommended for tax cases to prune pendency. claims for indirect and direct tax in litigation stood at rs 7.58 lakh cr by march 2017 employment real estate and construction sector will create over 15 million jobs over next five years despite signs of stress in the segment in last few quarters demonetisation has encouraged financial savings tax collection by states, local govts lower than those in other federal countries insolvency code being actively used to resolve npa woes policy vigilance needed if oil prices stay high or stock prices correct sharply foreign exchange reserves grew by 14.1% from end of dec 2016 to end of dec 2017 climate change has had an adverse impact on agricultural yields swachh bharat initiative improved sanitation coverage in rural areas from 39% to 76% indian society exhibits a strong desire for a male child survey in pink colour to highlight gender issues cea: crony socialism to stigmatised capitalism the last 50-60 years have seen a shift in attitude from what i call crony socialism to stigmatised capitalism. —arvind subramanian, cea in 2 yrs, universal basic income: govt chief economic adviser arvind subramanian expressed hope that at least one or two states will implement the idea of universal basic income (ubi) in the next two years. subramanian in the economic survey 2016-17 had mooted the idea of universal basic income or a uniform stipend paid to every adult and child, poor or rich. “i can bet... within the next two years, at least one or two states will implement ubi,” subramanian said.",7-7.5 % growth projected 2018-19,"sanjeev sharma new delhi , january 29 identifying employment , education agriculture core focus areas , economic survey 2017-18 projected recovery growth rate economy 7-7.5 per cent next fiscal impact demonetisation goods services tax ( gst ) wanes. economic survey 2017-18 presented parliament finance minister arun jaitley two days government ’ fifth final union budget pegged growth rate current fiscal 6.75 per cent recovery picked second half. edit : guarded growth ;

2018-06-14,less open defecation key factor in reducing anaemia among indian women,"vibha sharma  new delhi, june 14 open defecation is not just an attack on her dignity, it is also among three three key socio-demographic factors for anaemia in a pregnant woman. findings of this new study by researchers at international food policy research institute (ifpri) will be heartening for the government, leading the swachh bharat mission. according to the study, reduction of open-defecation in villages, increased age at pregnancy and education are three key socio-demographic factors in reducing anaemia among pregnant women in india. ; its findings suggest india’s efforts to focus on making entire villages open defecation-free and the promotion of diets rich in iron could have large benefits. when combined with good diet, these social changes may have long-lasting impacts that could substantially reduce the burden of anaemia among indian women, it says. “women of reproductive age experience a disproportionately large burden of anaemia due to menstrual blood losses as well as higher nutrient requirements and increased blood volume during pregnancy,” says samuel scott, lead researcher, ifpri-south asia region. “multi-sectoral public health policies and programmes that simultaneously target basic (eg early marriage), underlying (eg open defecation) and immediate (eg women’s education and diet) factors are likely to have the greatest impact on anaemia reduction among pregnant women.” co-authored by ifpri’s samuel scott and suman chakrabarti, and colleagues from oxford policy management and public health foundation of india, the study explores how shifts in socio-demographic, programmatic and dietary factors impact the prevalence of anaemia among pregnant women in india. the study, recently published in the journal, public health nutrition, was an analysis of 446 indian districts and more than 17,000 pregnant women aged 15-49. “anaemia among pregnant women is of concern, as it increases the likelihood of maternal mortality, risk of infection, preterm delivery, and poor foetal and infant health,” added scott. “quality of life in anaemic women is also impacted, with studies showing reduced work capacity as well as poorer physical performance and neuropsychological outcomes.” it observed that an average increase of 2.2 years in age at pregnancy and 22 per cent reduction in village-level open defecation from 2002 to 2012 accounted for an estimated 7 per cent and 9 per cent of the observed anemia decline, respectively. however, a 6-7 per cent increase in urbanisation over a decade accounted for an estimated 1.7 per cent increase in anaemia. “it is possible that women who migrate to urban areas experience an increased risk of anaemia due to unsanitary environmental conditions in urban slums and an inadequate consumption of nutrient-rich foods due to food being relatively more expensive in urban areas,” scott explained. the research, which took into consideration a 10-year period from 2002 to 2012, found anaemia prevalence among pregnant women fell by 16 percentage points. socio-demographic factors such as women getting pregnant later, being more educated and attending more antenatal care visits showed improvement. open defecation and use of wood as cooking fuel, although still high, also showed a decline during the same period. the study did not find significant changes in household supply of folic acid and vitamin b12, but noted a decline in both iron and phytate supply, partly driven by a reduction in the consumption of rice and wheat.",less open defecation key factor reducing anaemia among indian women,"vibha sharma new delhi , june 14 open defecation attack dignity , also among three three key socio-demographic factors anaemia pregnant woman. findings new study researchers international food policy research institute ( ifpri ) heartening government , leading swachh bharat mission. according study , reduction open-defecation villages , increased age pregnancy education three key socio-demographic factors reducing anaemia among pregnant women india. ;
