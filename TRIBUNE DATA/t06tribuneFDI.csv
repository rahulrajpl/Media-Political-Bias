""there are some illogical provisions (in land acquisition act) like land can’t be used or acquired under this law for private hospitals and schools... there are some factors in it, which certainly require a re-look,"" he said, adding that such provisions would make it difficult to build smart cities being proposed by the government. the focus, he said, is to make the entire process smoother. on privatisation and greater access to foreign investors, he said the government was currently following the approach of divestment rather than outright privatisation. jaitley said he was okay with loss-making public sector units being sold off. referring to the need for labour reforms, jaitley said some aspects of the labour laws in india can certainly be improved and rationalised. ""this is an area where we will have to have a much larger consideration... some people will certainly have reservation on this issue. will i be able to immediately get it passed in parliament? i am not in a position to comment,"" he said. the government needs to convince people that a flexible policy will create more jobs, said the finance minister. he said it is far more challenging to implement reforms in a developing society, as public opinion cannot be confronted. jaitley also noted that india was off the global radar for 2-3 years and the retrospective taxation was ""one bad idea"" that damaged the economy. the fm said the government's decision to further open defence and railways to foreign investment is evoking interest from investors. ""if the initial experiment succeeds, we can open up a lot more,"" the minister said. he expressed hope that the long-pending insurance amendment bill, that seeks to raise fdi in the sector from existing 26% to 49%, will get parliament nod in the upcoming winter session. on a question about subsidies, jaitley said petrol and diesel prices have already been de-controlled, and an expenditure management commission has been appointed to look into rationalisation of subsidies. nevertheless, he said, subsidies will not be eliminated completely as some sections of indian economy and people will always need support.(with agency inputs) ",fm promises easy land acquisition,"quote time , divestment important public undertakings verge closure. foreign investment , decisions made sector-wise , keeping mind requirements indian economy appetite political system reform. arun jaitley , fm box policy stability must : fm *jaitley said india needs ensure stability policy , including taxation , global investors come ; *we need open door wide open people come in. need ensure stability policy , stability taxation policy , therefore disagree lot things happened past , "" said *the fm said country needs world class infrastructure avenues provided people business making profits strap : promises reforms , divestment loss-making psus new delhi , november 5 finance minister arun jaitley today said government remove bottlenecks land acquisition process set smart cities open selling loss-making public sector undertakings ( psus ) . “reforms big bang ideas , ” said jaitley , kicking two-day india economic summit organised geneva-based world economic forum new delhi. asserting country needed doggedly pursue reforms agenda despite challenges , jaitley said union government ’ actions aimed eliminating discretion. gave example coal ordinance rules framed allocation mining licences , first state sector actual users e-auction. commercial mining private investors also envisaged , jaitley said interacting klaus schwab , founder executive chairman , world economic forum. finance minister said similar reforms planned minerals. land acquisition laws , jaitley said government looking changing ‘illogical provisions ’ .

2014-12-16,india third in stashing black money abroad,"washington, december 16 as india continues its pursuit of suspected black money stashed abroad, an international think-tank has ranked the country third globally with an estimated usd 94.76 billion (nearly rs 6 lakh crore) illicit wealth outflows in 2012. as a result, the cumulative illicit money moving out of the country over a ten-year period from 2003 to 2012 has risen to usd 439.59 billion (rs 28 lakh crore), as per the latest estimates released by the global financial integrity (gfi). russia is on the top with usd 122.86 billion, followed by china at the second position (usd 249.57 billion) in terms of the quantum of black money moving out of a country for 2012 -- the latest year for which these estimates have been made. the washington-based research and advocacy group further said that the illicit fund outflows from india accounts for nearly 10 per cent of a record usd 991.2 billion worth illegal capital that moved out of all developing and emerging nations in 2012 to facilitate “crime, corruption, and tax evasion”. ; as per gfi’s 2014 annual global update on illicit financial flows report, that the cumulative illicit outflows from developing economies for ten years between 2003 and 2012 stands at usd 6.6 trillion. this includes usd 439.59 billion worth illicit money that has moved out of india in these ten years, putting the country at fourth position in overall ranking for a decade, after china (usd 1.25 trillion), russia (973.86 billion) and mexico (usd514.26 billion). in these ten years, an average of usd 43.96 billion of black money is being sent out of india every year, gfi said. the estimate of this huge illegal money flow follows a supreme court-constituted special investigation team (sit) tracing rs 4,479 crore in the accounts of indians figuring in a list of account holders of hsbc’s geneva branch. besides, the sit has also disclosed tracing unaccounted wealth worth rs 14,958 crore within india, which are now being investigated by the enforcement directorate and the income tax department. the issue of black money has been matter of a serious political debate in india, including during the last general elections. while the new government has said it is committed to tackle this menace, there are no official figures for the overall size of illicit wealth stashed by indians within the country or abroad. as per gfi estimates, the amount of illicit funds that moved out of india in 2012 was much lower than the same for neighbouring china, as also russia. these three countries are followed by mexico at the fourth place (usd 59.66 billion) and malaysia at fifth (usd 48.93 billion). authored by gfi chief economist dev kar and gfi junior economist joseph spanjers, the study further said that illicit financial flows of a record high usd 991.2 billion in 2012 marks a dramatic increase from 2003, when size of such funds stood at usd 297.4 billion. over the decade (2003-2012), the study found that illicit financial flows are growing at an inflation-adjusted average rate of 9.4 per cent per year. however, in many parts of the world, particularly in the middle east and north africa (mena) and in sub-saharan africa, illicit flows are growing at an average annual inflation- adjusted rate of 24.2 and 13.2 per cent, respectively. “as this report demonstrates, illicit financial flows are the most damaging economic problem plaguing the world’s developing and emerging economies,” gfi president raymond baker said. “these outflows—already greater than the combined sum of all fdi and oda flowing into these countries — are sapping roughly a trillion dollars per year from the world’s poor and middle-income economies,” he said. however, the troubling fact is that these outflows are growing at an alarming rate of 9.4 per cent per year, which is twice as fast as global gdp, baker noted. according to him, it is simply impossible to achieve sustainable global development unless world leaders agree to address this issue head on. “that’s why it is essential for the united nations to include a specific target next year to halve all trade-related illicit flows by 2030 as part of post-2015 sustainable development agenda,” he said. pti ",india third stashing black money abroad,"washington , december 16 india continues pursuit suspected black money stashed abroad , international think-tank ranked country third globally estimated usd 94.76 billion ( nearly rs 6 lakh crore ) illicit wealth outflows 2012. result , cumulative illicit money moving country ten-year period 2003 2012 risen usd 439.59 billion ( rs 28 lakh crore ) , per latest estimates released global financial integrity ( gfi ) . russia top usd 122.86 billion , followed china second position ( usd 249.57 billion ) terms quantum black money moving country 2012 -- latest year estimates made. washington-based research advocacy group said illicit fund outflows india accounts nearly 10 per cent record usd 991.2 billion worth illegal capital moved developing emerging nations 2012 facilitate “crime , corruption , tax evasion ” . ;

2015-02-24,pranab says land act refined to suit farmers,"aditi tandon  new delhi, february 23 president pranab mukherjee on monday said the land acquisition act had been suitably changed to suit farmers’ interests. delivering his address to the joint sitting of parliament at the start of the budget session, pranab said: “taking utmost care to protect farmers’ interests, including compensation entitlements, the right to fair compensation and transparency in land acquisition, rehabilitation and resettlement act has been suitably refined to minimise certain procedural difficulties in acquisition of land inevitably required for critical public projects.” pranab’s tone was in contrast to the one expressed outside by social activist anna hazare who began his anti- ordinance agitation today and opposition parties which said they won’t allow the land ordinance to get through parliament. ; congress president sonia gandhi called pranab’s address a ‘repackaging of congress’ programmes.” earlier, prime minister narendra modi had appealed to political leaders to allow parliament to function smoothly saying all their concerns would be addressed and issues debated. the opposition, however, appeared tough with congress’ abhishek singhvi saying the party’s support on land ordinance should not be taken for granted and that even on the other five ordinances, including the one on fdi in insurance, there was no blank cheque for the government. president’s address with references to government’s nine-month efforts on economic, education, health, poverty alleviation and women’s safety issues, failed to impress the opposition which said the speech lacked depth. bjd’s bhartruhari mahtab described the address “visionless” saying it was not the kind of address one had expected to precede the government’s presentation of the first full general budget. bsp’s mayawati and sp’s mulayam singh yadav also slammed the address as “nothing new”. the president in his address voiced government’s commitment to prevention of the generation of black money domestically and internationally saying several steps had been taken to that end. he also reiterated government’s determination to quickly enact the goods and services tax for streamlining the indirect tax regime and widening the tax base. the bill was earlier introduced in parliament. on economy, the president mentioned how the gdp was growing at 7.4 per cent making india the fastest growing large economy in the world saying, “a strong beginning has been made and a promising future awaits us’. the principal stress in president’s speech was on anti-poverty measures, including jan dhan yojana, cleanliness as an article of faith for the government; nregs for value asset building and direct benefit transfer scheme. on cleanliness the president urged every mp to spend 50 per cent from his mplads funds on “swachh bharat” campaign – a suggestion congress’ lok sabha leader mallikarjun kharge dismissed saying mps needed the freedom to decide where they wanted to spend their funds. the lok sabha business advisory committee met on monday and decided to debate the president’s address for two days starting tomorrow.

2015-04-27,india may adopt us-style law to block mergers and acquisitions,"new delhi, april 27 india may adopt an american-style mechanism where the head of the government has the authority to block or unwind mergers and acquisitions by foreign companies that could threaten national security. the issue has come up in inter-ministerial discussions on chinese investment in sensitive sectors like seaports, airports, telecom, aviation in the wake of prime minister narendra modi's ""make-in-india"" campaign. ahead of modi's visit to china next month, a note was prepared by the national security council secretariat (nscs) to discuss security-related concerns applicable to fdi in some 'sensitive and strategic' sectors. during the meeting, it was suggested that the country needs legislative measures similar to exon-florio amendment to the us defence production act 1950 under which the us president can block or unwind mergers and acquisitions. ""it has been expressed in certain quarters that india needs legislative measures similar to the exon-florio amendment to the us defence production act 1950 which provides the us president the authority to block or unwind mergers and acquisitions by foreign companies that could threaten national security,"" the note said. ; as per existing regulations, government or fipb approval is required for transfer of ownership or control of indian companies in those sectors which have caps for foreign investment. ""however, if a foreign investment is found to be working against national interests, presently we do not have any legal framework to address the same,"" the note said and drew the attention towards a decision of committee of secretaries in march 2010 which had favoured an appropriate legislation to act in cases where national security issues arise post-investment. exon–florio amendment the exon–florio amendment was brought in force in 1988 under which the president of the united states may block the investments from foreign countries if it is found affecting national security or pose a threat to security. ""department of industrial policy and promotion (dipp) may consider taking up the matter with legislative department of the ministry of law and justice to work out an appropriate legislative framework,"" the note said. during the nscs meeting, indian security agencies expressed the view that some sectors like seaports, airports, aviation, telecom, internet service providers, petroleum refining, hydrocarbon exploration, shipping, roads pharmaceuticals, defence and metallurgy are sensitive from security point of view. with a focus on china, it was stated that india continued to view with concerns chinese investments in power and telecom sectors, which were increasingly relying on chinese companies for execution of projects and supply of low-cost equipment and spare parts and maintenance. the note said ""such high import dependency in these crucial sectors is not desirable. the domestic manufacturing capacity in these sectors does not commensurate with demand and needs to be expanded. ""too much dependence on foreign imports, including from china and other countries, in these sectors also poses security concerns with regard to embedded or rough software or malware, attack on network, leakage of information and data and remote access,"" it said. the security agencies are of the opinion that presence of chinese companies/ projects/ personnel in some sensitive locations such as in proximity of border areas, sensitive locations etc., is also a cause of concern. besides, indian security agencies have expressed apprehensions regarding lack of transparency of some companies with respect to their management and financial structure and shareholding pattern and funding. some of these companies are said to maintain close relationship with people's liberation army and china's security establishment. ""some chinese companies blur the line between national and corporate interests,"" it said. the other issues with regard to china include that it is often accused of unfair trade practices that include illegal subsidies to its exporters, dumping, artificially devaluing the yuan and indulging in intellectual property rights violations. ""china reportedly has the largest number of trade-related disputes with its trading partners,"" it said. the nscs note said that india welcomes fdi in consonance with its overall fdi policy and the ""make-in-india"" initiative, but security aspects related to fdi need to be taken into account. measures taken to address security concerns are not country-specific. investments requiring fipb approval in the so-called sensitive sectors should be security-scrutinised in a time-bound manner within a period of 60 days. the referring ministries should ensure that all information is provided in the first instance to ensure no delay. any security concerns raised by agencies concerned may be accepted or rejected by the home ministry. the final decision on the investment proposal will rest with fipb which will co-opt the home secretary in its meetings for considering investment proposals identified to have security implications. irrespective of the automatic or fipb route, post investment monitoring should be adequately strengthened in the sensitive sectors. investments through the automatic route in sensitive sectors could be intimated to concerned agencies for information and, if considered necessary, the project could be monitored, it said. the list of sensitive sectors needs to be clearly and carefully worked out and should contain only those sectors where there is a clear inter-ministerial consensus on why the sector should be treated as sensitive from investment point of view. the inter-ministerial process chaired by the home ministry could also identify sensitive areas where foreign investment needs to be discouraged. this could involve areas in proximity of the border and vital/sensitive installations. agencies should develop clear triggers of national security concern to be used while scrutinising applications. development of adequate testing facilities for products in sensitive sectors requires urgent attention. foreign companies may also be encouraged to set up testing facilities in india. on the technology part, sectoral regulators may also standardise specifications for hardware and software, the note said. — pti ",india may adopt us-style law block mergers acquisitions,"new delhi , april 27 india may adopt american-style mechanism head government authority block unwind mergers acquisitions foreign companies could threaten national security. issue come inter-ministerial discussions chinese investment sensitive sectors like seaports , airports , telecom , aviation wake prime minister narendra modi ' "" make-in-india "" campaign. ahead modi ' visit china next month , note prepared national security council secretariat ( nscs ) discuss security-related concerns applicable fdi ' sensitive strategic ' sectors. meeting , suggested country needs legislative measures similar exon-florio amendment us defence production act 1950 us president block unwind mergers acquisitions.

2015-05-30,"'call for achhe din was to get rid of the bad, we have achieved that'","completing his first year in delhi, prime minister narendra modi speaks to raj chengappa, editor-in-chief of the tribune group of newspapers, on the challenges and successes he faced, and plans for the future. in his by now well-known quick-fire manner, the man from gujarat takes jibes at the previous government and its leadership, while keeping his campaign mode alive. read the full text. the late prime minister rajiv gandhi, who was the last person with a parliamentary majority before you, described people’s expectations of him as “scary”. at the end of one year, what is your impression of running the government? from the potential i have seen in the country, i believe there is no logic in it staying poor and underdeveloped. countries that attained freedom much later have developed more than us; we too could have been there. there is nothing lacking in the country. i won’t go into where we went wrong or who did wrong. when i spoke of swachh bharat on august 15 last year, i knew i was taking a risk, but i was amazed at the response that i received, it was beyond my imagination. even the media that is usually critical of the government (which is natural and how it should be) has been furthering this particular campaign. such has been the awareness created today that children point out to their parents if they litter. i must admit even though i am pained to see filth, i was not confident if i would be able to create a culture of cleanliness, but people have caught on. they are not going to have any personal gains from this, yet they are working for it. this has shown the real strength of the country. then i have seen the strength of the government machinery. when i declared we’ll open bank accounts before january 26, everyone was shocked: this is something that has never happened in 60 years, what is this man saying! but within around 100 days, before december 25, the targets were nearly met by all. the government machinery and bank employees went to people’s homes. this shows if given clear guidance and road map are given, government employees have the ability to deliver results. what has been your main thrust in the first year, what did you want to do? the country had seen such ‘burre din’, everything was at a standstill, so the foremost question on my mind was where do i begin? i was new for delhi, delhi was new for me, i had also not had much interaction with delhi or its bureaucracy. so to shed light to see how things were, i started with small trials to see if the system’s frequency matched mine or not. and within three i months i found it matched perfectly. that gave me a huge confidence. for instance a concept like being punctual to work; we didn’t take out a circular, i just started arriving on time myself and soon i saw people all around had started doing that. so far no one has faced action for being late; i take a sympathetic view of the matter, a person could be late because of some family issue, he can’t be sacked for that. so i combine self-discipline in personal life with a humane approach to others. in all of this, my 13 years’ experience has been of tremendous use. ; what is the difference you find between running a state, as you did in gujarat, and running a nation? fundamentally there is no difference. ultimately, you have to run the administration, do human resource management. but at the centre there are certain new domains, such as defence or foreign affairs. one issue is that in states you have an organic team, but at the centre it is an assembled team that has come in from states for two or three years. so to run the government in delhi, one has to set up a team that is homogenous and has members who will spend 30-35 years here, a team that will be able to function here. people keep taunting you with the question where are the ‘achhe din’? what exactly do you mean by achhe din and have you delivered? when visiting an ailing person, we say don’t worry, he’ll be well [“achha ho jayega”]. the word ‘achha’ [good] here is in the context of the ‘burra’ [bad] that the patient is going through. so my idea of ‘achhe din’ is riddance of that bad. and i believe we have achieved this. our opponents started with making fun of the idea, asking every time a train would be late if it were achhe din. it would have been good if these people had asked the congress ‘gareebi hatao’ has been your slogan since 1970, has it happened? they had a strength of 415 in parliament, four people of one family have run the country, what did they achieve? so my definition of achhe din is in the context of everyday life and the ‘bad days’ that prevailed — corruption, scams, policy paralysis, black money, coal, spectrum.... the country was fed up with all of this. and you have changed that in this one year? there is no question of such things now. what do you hear on coal auctions now? rs 3 lakh crore will come to the government’s coffers. how did you bring about this ‘cleaning up of corruption’? there has to be zero tolerance on this matter at the top. just my being honest is not enough. it should be visible in my speech, conduct, manner, policy, tradition, everything. i alone being ‘pure’ will not do. the way to achieve this is to lay down a policy on everything in black and white. the grey areas should be minimal, even if they can’t be zero. bureaucrats then have very little scope for discrimination; that in turn leaves no scope for corruption. are there going to be more measures to block corruption like this? i’ll give you instances: the government used to buy led bulbs at rs 348, now it is rs 80. a cement sack was procured at rs 360, now it is rs 150 — though my figures may not be exact. what about bringing back the black money that was promised? first of all, none of those who have been in power thus far have any right to question my government on black money. all this black money was generated because they took no measures to check it. despite directions from the supreme court, they did not constitute an sit for three years. this means people holding black money were given that period to cover their trails. had they acted the day the court gave the orders, the country would have gained billions of rupees. the first decision of our first cabinet meeting was to create an sit, which is given all information, and it passes it on to the supreme court in sealed covers. yes, we don’t inform the media because there are international legal issues involved. to get black money back from abroad we need cooperation of countries around the world. at the g20 summit, i ensured an entry regarding cooperation on black money in the final resolution. so can we expect all people hoarding black money will be caught and their names revealed? names we can give only to the supreme court because we are bound by law, but we are going to spare no one. i would ask the tribune as well to give us any information it may have on black money. has anyone dared to create a law as tough as we have on this? despite your efforts against corruption the opposition calls you are a ‘suit-boot ki sarkar’, you favour corporates. i want to request a group of senior journalists to compile a list of all the criticism that has been there against my government. someone finds meanings for the acronym m.o.d.i., some say nda is mnda, some call us arrogant, others discuss a suit or a boot, or coat or hair. just look at their bankruptcy, they are not being able to identify a single concrete issue. this is the greatest achievement of this government. an issue that concerns punjab and haryana particularly is farmer distress. the charge is that the centre did not move quickly enough when unseasonal rain damaged farmers’ crops and they were committing suicide. also why did you not visit the affected people? let us look at the record. as chief minister of gujarat — which was struck by calamities every other year — i had got tired of submitting memorandums to the central government, but they did not so much as glance at us. this year after the hail damage, chief ministers in all bjp-ruled states immediately visited farmers, officials were sent out to survey the damage. there had been a long-standing policy that compensation would be paid to farmers only if the damage was more than 50 per cent. we brought that down to 33 per cent. the compensation was increased by 50 per cent. earlier, damaged grain was not procured by government agencies. this time we decided to procure all grain, and that too without any cut in the msp. these were decisions for which farmers had been crying for years. as for my visiting farms, tell me if a congress leader has visited a farm in the past 10 years. were there no farming calamities? as chief minister i used to regularly visit farmers. my job now was to collect information, take decisions, mobilise the machinery. i did not go to nepal either, but did we not do work there? your party agreed with the land acquisition bill. now it is trying to amend it. why? people allege it is anti-farmer and pro-corporate. for 60 years they went with the old land acquisition laws. were they anti-farmer all this while? those who have forced 3 lakh farmers to commit suicide have no moral authority to complain now. the earlier law was 120 years old. for political interest they hurriedly brought in a law. in parliament they agreed orally to accept the changes suggested by the bjp, particularly regarding irrigation. but later on they removed those from the draft. after the nda came to power, we realised there were certain points in the law that would have made the farmers’ situation worse if we did not bring in the ordinance. also, chief ministers of several states ruled by various parties came to demand changes in the law, including kerala. we could not have made it a point of ego to say that we won’t change the law just because we supported it in 2013. our intention is to amend only those provisions in the 2013 act that militate against the process of growth and are against the interest of farmers. the reforms in this act will ensure greater irrigation potential, rural infrastructure, including electricity, schools and hospitals. the debate should be on merit. are you confident of getting the bill passed in parliament? this is not a matter of life or death for me. and neither was it the agenda of my party or the government. the initiative was in response to a demand from the states, and being a federal structure it was my duty to respond. so i am trying my level best. i am still prepared to accept any suggestions. do you plan a new deal for the farmers? the farmer is the backbone of our nation; 60 per cent of the population is engaged in farm-related activities. however, agriculture’s contribution to the gdp is only 15 per cent. we need to modernise agriculture to improve productivity and quality. we have introduced soil health cards which would help the farmer in reducing his cost and increase productivity. the prime minister’s krishi sinchai yojana will improve the irrigation potential. to provide banking facilities to farmers, we have successfully launched the jan dhan yojana, which provides overdraft facility also. what would you list as your major achievements in the past one year? i can say with pride that there has not been a single instance of corruption. our mission and commitment is towards the country’s progress. we have embarked on a path of transparency, efficiency and effectiveness in our policies. initiatives like the jan dhan yojana, swachh bharat abhiyan, soil health card and the recently launched social security schemes for the people at large are aimed at giving more income and security to the common man. on infrastructure, last year we awarded projects for the construction of more than 20 km of roads per day, and the construction has been achieved at a rate of more than 11 km per day. electricity generation has shown a growth of 9 per cent in 2014-15 over the previous year. emphasis on renewable energy is demonstration of the fact that we not only care about the present but also the future. the recent union budget gave a boost of rs 1 lakh crore to the infrastructure sector through public investment. pooling of gas for stalled power projects and fertiliser units shows our commitment to address the bottlenecks of the previous government. we have taken up the task of construction of toilets in every school. it is unfortunate that even after almost 68 years of independence our schools did not have functional toilets. our initiative of distribution of lpg and scholarships through direct bank transfers to beneficiary accounts is evidence of our intentions to focus on the poor and needy. new interventions on ganga rejuvenation, skill development, mobile and broadband connectivity for all villages, and ‘make in india’ is going to open new vistas of growth. this is just a beginning. on the economy, are you satisfied with the progress made so far with regard to inflation, jobs, growth in production, investment and exports? the 10-year period of the previous government was characterised by high prices and spiralling inflation. our efforts on both the demand and supply side have ensured that inflation is under check. it inflation is now well below 5 per cent. our efforts on economic front have been appreciated not only within the country but also by international organisations like imf, world bank and the oecd. as soon as we came to power we took proactive steps against hoarding, released additional food grains in the market and imported items that were in short in supply in the country. these steps have borne fruit and the inflation that was hovering around 10-12 per cent has now been moderated. in spite of inheriting an economy with huge problems we have been able to take corrective action that is visible from the fact that we have in the last year limited our fiscal deficit to 4 per cent as against our target of 4.1 per cent. foreign direct investment has risen by 39 per cent and foreign institutional investment (fii) has grown by 800 per cent. the foreign currency reserves are at an all-time high of us $35 billion. this also shows tremendous confidence of foreign investors in our economy. the gdp growth last year was 7.4 per cent. in the current year india’s gdp growth is expected to be the highest amongst all major economies of the world. we have taken more initiatives in this budget. mudra bank will help more than 6 crore small vendors and businesses, 61 per cent of who are sc, st, religious minorities or obc. we have also introduced the gst bill in parliament and are committed to its rollout from april 1, 2016. on ‘ease of doing business’, we have made substantial progress. these measures will mark a watershed in our growth story. we have made substantial progress in rationalising our procedures and forms. we are putting more and more approvals online. we have also relaxed fdi in various sectors, especially insurance. but people say you have been lucky with inflation, as oil prices went down substantially. when i say i am lucky, people attack me, they don’t like it! what is this? we have taken steps on inflation, but this is a volatile matter, and needs continued efforts. we’ll not leave it to luck. your call to “make-in-india” is significant. what has been the response? the response to the initiative has been very significant not only within india but outside as well. wherever i travelled in the past one year, i met senior executives of industry in that country and they all were very excited about our “make-in-india” plan. we have undertaken not only policy reforms but also focused on administrative reforms. we have laid emphasis on ease of doing business, making government more accountable, introducing technology in governance and reforms in all layers of government. we have essentially taken the reform process to an entirely different level where both the central and the state governments respond through a policy-based system and not by way of discretion or nepotism. similarly we are emphasising that the companies supplying defence equipment to us undertake to manufacture in india also. on defence, you went to france and made a bold decision to purchase 36 rafael fighter aircraft. people have questioned the rationale behind this step. a good government has to strike the right balance between different priorities. “make in india” is very important for me. so too is ensuring national security. i will not compromise on either. the purchase of rafale aircraft was guided by the need to respond to the immediate operational requirements of the air force which was affecting our defence capability. how can that be questioned? in fact, the challenge is to break a logjam that we inherited from the previous government. some decision had to be taken. we consulted all concerned and decided that we will have only a government-to-government deal. there will be transparency, so no one will be able to raise questions. there will be further discussions on this matter soon. i would mention that during my recent visit to france, the senior leadership of their defence industry showed great enthusiasm for participating in our “make in india” programme. do you think this way is going to be the future of defence procurement? that will be decided case to case. will you deliver on the one-rank-one-pension (orop) promise to the defence personnel? we are committed to orop, but we are in consultation with defence personnel regarding the definition of orop. our government is here for five years, and we cannot do anything without consulting the people concerned. the dialogue is being actively pursued. there is no need to have any doubt on this. the tribune has a large readership among defence personnel, and through you i would like to assure them we are absolutely committed. it is just that there are too many definitions going around yet, and we are looking for one on which all stakeholders agree. for me this is not a political agenda. skill india is something you have championed. how do you plan to make india the skill capital of the world? we have a large young population and it is very important to provide them with requisite education and skill-sets for gainful employment. accordingly, the government has placed maximum emphasis on this and has created a new ministry of skill development and entrepreneurship. the strategy is to upgrade and create new institutions to provide modern skills to our people. the ministry in consultation with state governments is mapping the available skills in each district. the skill curriculum is being revised, quality training of trainers and collaboration with private sector is being initiated. i am confident that with these efforts, we should be able to create a large pool of very skilled manpower that would act as a catalyst for our programme of “make in india”. it would also be available to other countries facing shortage of such skilled manpower. foreign policy has been a success area for you. what is thrust of your foreign policy, what is the mission with which you went to all these nations? first, i have travelled abroad no more than earlier prime ministers. the media needs to bring out facts, and not create wrong perceptions. then you can look at the outcomes. thus far we have been a balancing power, always seeking others’ favour. how long can we continue to do that? why don’t we grow into a global player? it is clear in my mind we are no more just a balancing power, but a global player. we speak on equal terms with all, whether it is the us or china. today we approach the world with greater self-assurance. we have shown the confidence to engage all major powers simultaneously and effectively. with our seven neighbours, our guiding principal is to have a humanitarian approach. even foreign policy ‘experts’ in the country have not noticed that our interaction with all these seven countries has been on humanitarian issues. we helped the maldives with drinking water; sri lanka pronounced the death sentence for five indian fishermen, but we brought them back alive, when they (upa) could not get one sarabjit from pakistan; in afghanistan we rescued father prem who had been kidnapped by the taliban. in nepal, we arrived immediately to do our duty as a neighbour. from yemen, we rescued people of 48 nationalities trapped amidst the fighting there; we saved some people from pakistan, and pakistan saved some of our people. what about iraq – punjabis are still being held captive there. in iraq, we have saved so many people, including nurses. on the other missing indians there, we don’t have very definite information, so we are hoping for the best. you are visiting bangladesh next week after resolving the border issue. will there be also a deal on the sharing of teesta waters? we had settled the long pending land boundary issues with bangladesh by taking all parties into confidence. the media has not realised this was a massive achievement and is talking of other issues. had this been elsewhere in the world this would have been cited as an example as big as the fall of the berlin wall. the entire mood of our neighbourhood has changed dramatically because of our message of shared prosperity being implemented on the ground. mine is practical and outcome-based diplomacy. do you think india can sort out the border issue with china as we did with bangladesh? i have just met the people of china, and realised that a window of trust is open. let’s see where it takes us. this is a very important relationship which has its complexities and challenges. i am deeply committed to improving our ties. president xi expressed similar sentiments during his interactions with me. creating a more positive environment to expand our economic cooperation and address outstanding differences on the border is the immediate goal. this can only happen if we ensure peace and tranquillity on the line of actual control. we need to show sensitivity to each other’s concerns. at the same time, mutual interest must guide our cooperative endeavours and i am confident that this will be the case. we have a huge negative trade balance with china and our engagement with them on the economic front is an attempt to address this by encouraging chinese companies to come and invest in india. but the chinese appear to be playing a dual game? india must have confidence in itself. world relations are not founded on suspicion. you invited nawaz sharif for your swearing-in ceremony. but after that relations have not moved forward? our effort at all times is to promote friendship with pakistan. all i can say is bombs do not help. we have had done enough of fighting, there have been wars, terrorism, but that has not got us anywhere. it is time we joined hands to fight poverty. people on both sides will benefit. the vision of cooperation, connectivity and contacts that i presented to leaders of our neighbouring countries remains very much on the table. with pakistan, obviously we can only progress in an atmosphere free of terror. they know that the basis of our engagement is the simla agreement and the lahore declaration. if they take a step forward accordingly, i am willing to take two. but there can be no compromise on our national security. in j&k, your party has formed the government with the pdp. that is historic. do you think the government will stabilise? will the issue of afspa be a hurdle? there is a larger picture there. we have to respect the mandate of the people. it could either be an elected government or governor’s rule. in the latter option, we would have had total control, but that is not what we wanted. it is a fact that the ideologies of the two parties are very different, but people wanted us to work together in both jammu and kashmir regions. the alliance in the state is one of the most important developments on the political scene. it has the potential to resolve one of our most difficult national problems through people’s participation and good governance. we need to understand that the two parties have varied views on some very important issues. however, we have taken a pledge to work for the development of the state and its people. both the parties have come together on an agreed common minimum programme. it is now our duty to rise to the expectations of the people of the state and implement the common minimum programme in letter and spirit and not digress from it. and the demand on lifting afspa? as i said, strictly follow whatever is agreed upon in the minimum programme. you have strong development agenda. but there are some leaders in the party and ministers in the government who speak out of turn. there is a feeling that some of your own people are not respecting the moratorium on communal tension that you had called for on independence day. it is not correct and wherever an individual view might have been expressed which is not in consonance with our ideology, we have immediately negated that. how long would you flog one instance? one minister said something inappropriate, he apologised in the house; the party as well as i condemned his statement. continuing to harp on these issues will not serve any purpose. it is a country of 1.25 billion, you can’t ascribe to the government everything that someone mutters. tell me what crisis has been there in the country in the past one year. so there is no reason for the minority communities to feel insecure? i have mentioned this earlier and let me emphasise it again: the constitution of india will be a guiding force for us and the unity and integrity of our country is our top-most priority. all religions and communities have the same rights and it is the responsibility of my government to ensure that all indians have equal rights and opportunities. in the second year, what can we expect from the government? it will be development, development and development. jobs, jobs and jobs.","' call achhe din get rid bad , achieved '","completing first year delhi , prime minister narendra modi speaks raj chengappa , editor-in-chief tribune group newspapers , challenges successes faced , plans future. well-known quick-fire manner , man gujarat takes jibes previous government leadership , keeping campaign mode alive. read full text. late prime minister rajiv gandhi , last person parliamentary majority , described people ’ expectations “scary ” . end one year , impression running government ?

2015-08-05,fm regrets delay in gst rollout,"new delhi, aug 5 finance minister arun jaitley on wednesday urged the congress to help the central government in rolling out the goods and services tax, which he claimed had the potential to drive india’s up gdp by 1 to 2 per cent. while participating in a debate on supplementary demand for grants amid a boycott by congress and a number of other opposition parties, jailtley claimed india could see an 8 per cent growth as the government is taking a host of steps to boost investment besides reviving stalled projects and pumping in more funds into psu banks. in addition, ""rain gods have been kinder this year which is expected result in a good harvest,"" he said. jaitley said the government will infuse rs 70,000 crore in psu banks in the four years and they will raise another rs 1.10 lakh crore from the market, making them healthier to finance economic growth. ""if my friends (congress), who are not present in house today, allow implementation of gst, which was introduced by congress, you will have an uniform tax rate, one market and it is capable of boosting economy by 1-2 per cent. ""in adverse situation we can touch 8 per cent if banks are recapitalised, gst implemented, stalled projects revived and infrastructure spending improves,"" he said. ; the gst bill, which proposes to usher in a uniform indirect taxation system throughout the country, is stuck in rajya sabha which is unable to function because of opposition protests over various issues. turning to china, which has been the world's fastest growing economy, jaitley said it has slowed down and its wage bills have gone up, pushing up the cost of its products. in this context, jaitley said, ""it is for us to become a manufacturing hub. it is then the indian economy will achieve full potential"". the finance minister said india, which is targeting to grow by over 8 per cent in a sustained manner, is a ""bright spot"" among the global economies. india grew at 7.3 per cent last year and rbi has projected this year's growth to be 7.6 per cent. ""in this global environment where global winds are not favourable. ... in past few years, we have come down to reasonably bottom pit... under prime minister narendra modi's leadership, we are reviving the economy and it is responsibility of all of us to cooperate to enhance growth rate,"" jaitley said. he said global economies are facing challenges and even for a high growth economy like china, the new normal is 7 per cent or below. ""this year we are targeting to touch a growth of about 8 per cent. obviously when we grow by a larger growth rate, a revenue buoyancy also comes in. the first few months of the current year appear to be giving some green shoots, and one of those green shoots is in the area of indirect revenue,"" jaitley said. while talking about the woes of banking sector, he said steel, power and highways sectors account for maximum non-performing assets. ""we inherited an economy where npa of banks was 6 per cent. there were stressed assets of another 6 per cent. and in those stressed assets there may be some hidden npa. so we have decided to racapitalise the banks. the government has decided to use tax payers' money, put it in banking system,"" he said. he said when banks become healthy with initial capital coming in, they would be in a position to take the burden of financing the growth of the indian economy. external factors are also reasonable with a record foreign exchange reserve, 49 per cent increase in fdi in first few months of the year and an under-control cad, he said.

a host of incentives and other benefits to both airport developers and operators have been proposed to ensure the tariff of no more than rs 2,500 per ticket for each flying-hour. to fund regional connectivity to under-served and un-served destinations in the country, the policy proposes the creation of a viability gap funding with incentives such as creation of regional connectivity fund and 2 per cent levy on all air tickets — domestic and international — on routes other than cat ii a and rcs. along with providing upfront concessions, it talks of providing airlines and stakeholders incentives such as tax benefits. but at the same time, 2 per cent cess means passengers flying other than rcs and cat ii a routes will pay more. to increase regional connectivity, the government plans to revive dilapidated airports and airstrips. as per the policy, the unused assets of the country, around 300 airports lying unutilised, will be upgraded to no-frill airports at a cost of rs 50 crore each. the country has around 430 airstrips and airports but only 90 are in operation. to reduce extra costs, the policy talks of making operations-security aircraft-based. in other words, the airport will be sanitised an hour or two before the flight. the policy also proposes liberalising the regime of bilateral rights leading to greater ease of doing business and wider choice to passengers. the fdi in airlines has been proposed to be increased from 49% to above 50% if india decides to go in for open skies for countries lying within 5,000 km radius. the ministry has also proposed a replacement to the 5/20 rule. the existing rule requires an indian airline to have a fleet of 20 aircraft and operational experience of five years to commence international operations. the push for air travel proposed under the regional connectivity scheme is expected to boost domestic air traffic to 30 crore by 2022. domestic air ticketing is expected to go up further to 50 crore by 2027, the policy says. it includes proposals to rationalise the high jet fuel cost, which constitutes the bulk of the cost of airline operations, promotion of air cargo and maintenance, repair and operations (mro) through monetary and it concessions. for helicopter operations, the policy has mooted separate dgca regulations and creation of heli-hubs. the policy will also have a fixed period of existence, so that the industry can plan in advance, the minister said. the policy will be notified after public consultations and clearance by the cabinet. “a lot of consultation has taken place. we invite suggestions from stakeholders and public, since it involves the people of india. after all those suggestions come in, we will look into it,” the minister said.",regional flying set get affordable,"vibha sharma new delhi , october 30 centre today unveiled draft national civil aviation policy aims achieving high regional connectivity affordable costs incentivising stakeholders , reviving ailing airports creating no-frill ones besides levying 2 per cent air tickets. policy , unveiled civil aviation minister pusapati ashok gajapathi raju deputy mahesh sharma , public domain inputs stakeholders others. regional connectivity scheme ( rcs ) , government looks take “flying masses ” proposing airfares close “rs 2,500 one hour flight ” , almost similar ac-class rail fares. rcs come effect april 1 , 2016. ;

2015-11-02,jaitley says pm worst victim of ideological intolerance,"sanjeev sharma  new delhi, november 1 finance minister arun jaitley today attacked the opposition for obstructing growth through “a structured and organised propaganda” and said prime minister narendra modi has been the worst victim of ideological intolerance since 2002. this is being seen as a counter-attack by the government, which has been accused of fanning intolerance in the country in the light of incidents such as the dadri killing and ban on beef. in a blog, “ease of doing business”, on his facebook page, jaitley who had earlier termed the return of awards by writers in protest against rising intolerance “manufactured dissent” said while the modi-led government was trying to accelerate india’s growth, there were many who had never intellectually accepted the idea of the bjp being in power. ; “this obviously includes the congress, many left thinkers and activists. over decades they have practised ideological intolerance towards bjp. since 2002, the prime minister himself has been the worst victim of ideological intolerance,” jaitley said. as the debate over intolerance is getting louder by the day, even drawing comments from global ratings agencies such as moody’s, the government’s narrative is now moving to economic growth and its obstruction being caused by a vitiated environment. attacking the opposition, jaitley said their strategy was twofold. “first, obstruct parliament and do not permit reforms, which will bring credit to modi government. second, create, by structured and organised propaganda, an environment that there is a social strife in india. they wish to project india as an intolerant society. the truth is otherwise.” the bjp has also been accused of using obstruction and stalling tactics in parliament when the upa government was in power, which led to the gst, insurance and other important legislations being held up. the government launched a counter-attack on its critics, including the opposition, by alleging they were the ones indulging in intolerance. “perpetrators of this propaganda never allowed alternative viewpoints to grow either in universities, academic institutions or cultural bodies that they have controlled. their intolerance extends to not accepting an alternative ideological pole,” jaitley alleged. the finance minister also warned of obstruction of growth and asked the supporters of the government to show restraint. “it is, therefore, incumbent upon every well-wisher of india and the present government to make sure that no action or statement of his provides a tool in the hands of those who want to obstruct india’s growth story. the obstructers have a simple plan — if they can’t fight politically, they fight with hostile propaganda.” on the economic front, jaitley talked of the boost to india’s rankings in the world bank’s ease of doing business and hinted at some new reforms. claiming more transparency in the government, the finance minister said: “investors no longer queue up before the mantralayas in delhi lobbying for policy changes or approvals.” jaitley noted that the states had also altered their work culture, which had led to competitive federalism for investments. jaitley said the gujarat model of global investors meet had been replicated in tamil nadu, madhya pradesh, west bengal and in punjab. rajasthan would woo global investors this month. telangana and andhra pradesh have been reaching out to investors globally. jaitley said having opened most sectors for foreign direct investment, time had come to examine whether some of the conditionalities on which fdi investment is permitted had become anachronic.",jaitley says pm worst victim ideological intolerance,"sanjeev sharma new delhi , november 1 finance minister arun jaitley today attacked opposition obstructing growth “a structured organised propaganda ” said prime minister narendra modi worst victim ideological intolerance since 2002. seen counter-attack government , accused fanning intolerance country light incidents dadri killing ban beef. blog , “ease business ” , facebook page , jaitley earlier termed return awards writers protest rising intolerance “manufactured dissent ” said modi-led government trying accelerate india ’ growth , many never intellectually accepted idea bjp power. ;

another one says those who vote for us are ramzaade (progenies of ram) while all others are haramzaade (bastards). will you take the revenge of what happened with hindus in pakistan with muslims in india,” asked tyagi. ; “ambedkar would have never told even his opponents that they will be sent to pakistan. your minister speaks as if you are a travel agent of pakistan. ambedkar would have never supported that some particular religious book is imposed on all, the way an attempt is being made now to make india a theocratic state,” the jd(u) leader alleged. he also asked the bjp leaders to fight the congress but “not make an attempt to finish off the legacy of mahatma gandhi, jawaharlal nehru and indira gandhi. these are not their legacies but that of the nation,” he said, amid thumping of benches by members from the congress and other opposition parties. taking objection to jaitley’s reported remarks on whether an unelected house overrides the decision of the elected house, brien said the leader of the house makes statements outside the house “demeaning” the rajya sabha. “please do not indulge in cowboy constitutionalism. this is cowboy constitutionalism at the worst,” he said telling jaitley that he should not make such remarks only because the numbers in the rajya sabha do not favour the bjp. o’brien slammed jaitley for his remarks about rajya sabha citing the example of how the constituent assembly was indirectly elected by state legislatures, saying that this was a precursor to the rajya sabha. jaitley, the leader of the house, countered it saying that in a bicameral house of democracy, it’s a debate going on all over the world and a discussion about the two houses is “not cowboy constitutionalism”. a bicameral legislature is one in which legislators are divided into two separate assemblies, chambers or houses. faulting the nda government for bringing a number of ordinances, o’brien said “for every ten bills passed, the number of ordinances under pandit nehru was one, during janata party rule it was 1.2, during the upa 2 regime, 1.9 ordinances were passed for every ten bills. in the last 18 months, the number has gone up to three. this is another instance of cowboy constitutionalism of the bjp.” on the issue of secularism, he said the “line separating the fringe and the mainstream was fast blurring” and alleged that voices of divisiveness, which had gone silent for the last 10-12 years, were speaking up again. he quoted from rss ideologue m.s. golwalkar’s book on how non-hindus should leave in the country and a purported remark of the co-convenor of the swadeshi jagaran manch s. gurumurthy that hindutva has more legitimacy than the constitution. he also quoted prime minister narendra modi and trinamool congress chief mamata banerjee saying that the constitution is the holy book of this great nation and said the time has now come to decide which of the two ideas of india is right. there was also a minor sparring between o’brien and some cpi(m) members, who objected to the trinamool congress mp’s remarks that left had not supported the quit india movement in 1942. o’brien also quoted four lines from a book of left veteran e.m.s. namboodiripad, saying they committed a mistake in not participating in the quit india. latching to cpi-m member sitaram yechury’s remarks that the bjp which did not play any role in the freedom struggle was “worming” its way into the history of the independence movement, the tmc member said “at least the communists do not have the right to question it”. objecting to the remarks, cpi(m) members t.k. rangarajan and tapan sen said there were not many parties in indian history which had the courage to own up mistakes and brien should remember that his party was “not even born” when the freedom struggle took place. “there are many brands of history, your brand of history, their brand of history,” sen said. — pti ","bsp , jd( u ) extends support gst","new delhi , december 1 bsp , jd( u ) monday announced support government ’ economic reform measures , including gst , bjp-led ruling dispensation continued face combined opposition attack issue “intolerance ” controversial remarks union ministers. participating debate ‘commitment constitution ’ , trinamool congresss member derek ’ brien accused finance minister arun jaitley indulging “cowboy constitutionalism ” issue obstructions parliament. brien also got spat left leaders remarks cannot question right “not participating ” freedom struggle also done same. attacking bjp issue “hindu rashtra ” , k.c. tyagi ( jd-u ) cited low representation muslims political constitutional posts castigated bjp leaders ‘pakistan ’ remarks , reminding indian muslims go pakistan partition despite option. “we support gst , insurance bill ( raising fdi cap 26 49 percent ) . totally support coal mines ( bills ) . also ask 5-6 ministers cooperate constitution. one says former president abdul kalam muslim yet nationalist. muslim crime ?

2015-12-27,india did well in year of global economic turmoil: jaitley,"new delhi, december 27 finance minister arun jaitley brushed sceptics off on sunday as he said indian economy was the bright spot in turbulent global scenario with a growth of 7–7.5 per cent in 2015 and was likely to grow “still further”. he claimed: ""revenue collections do not go up without the economy taking off"". ""cynicism is a way of life in india. you can question any other data but you cannot question the actual rise of revenue and the actual rise of revenue is showing that the economy is doing better,"" he said. he however admitted there were areas that could see improvement. ""as the year ends, i look back with a sense of great satisfaction,"" jaitley said in an interview, attributing the growth to india's “sound” fiscal fundamentals. ; jaitley said structural reforms such as goods and services tax would take priority in the new year, as would rationalisation of directed taxes and removing glitches to ease doing business in india. ""after having done that, i would like to concentrate essentially on three things — more money for physical infrastructure, more money on social infrastructure and lastly more money on irrigation because that is a neglected sector."" besides global headwinds due to slowdown in china and weakness in commodity markets, india also had to face domestic challenges in form of two weak monsoons and slower private sector investment, making the management of the indian economy a ""great challenge”. ""private sector investments continued to be slow because the private sector had overstretched itself... they had surplus capacity and demand was slow."" he claimed the government responded well to these challenges by stepping up public investment, which has been complemented by 40 per cent rise in fdi and a rebound in consumption. “the government has utilised the savings from low oil prices for infrastructure spending, resulting in sectors like highways, rural roads and railways getting a significant step-up of investment. port areas have also been targets of private sector investments,” he said. ""as a result, despite the global slowdown and adversities, india became the bright spot in the global economy with a growth prospect of 7-7.5 per cent. it is lesser than our targetted 8 per cent. i have no doubt if we have had a normal monsoon, we would have been close to the target."" services sector remains strong while ""revival of manufacturing and the iip (index of industrial production) are high points of this year"", which is also reflected in record rise in indirect tax collections. ""inflation remains under control, the repo rate (the policy interest rate decided by rbi) has come down this year by 125 basis points. foreign exchange reserves were as good as always. compared to the rest of the global economies, we were far more stable vis-a-vis the dollar,"" jaitley said, summing up the macroeconomic trends for 2015. ""the year 2015 has been an extremely challenging year as far as economy is concerned, because the world economy has been going through a downturn,"" he said, adding that imports as well as exports have shrunk due to decline in prices and shrinking of the global trade. ""international trade has contracted. so both imports and exports have shrunk. in india context, the shrinkage is more in value (terms) because the prices are low and to some extent in volumes because of the shrinkage of global trade,"" he said. jaitley claimed government continues to work on its reforms — including fdi norms — and some old taxation issues were being resolved ""one by one"".

""in fact, a national party adopting a disruptionist role and getting a sadistic pleasure in stalling a reform which could add to india's gdp is a disappointment.

2016-01-05,stop labour reforms in name of ease of doing biz: unions to govt,"vibha sharma  new delhi, january 4 the government’s “too much romance with corporates is creating colossal loss to the social sector”, the bhartiya mazdoor sangh, a labour union affiliated to the rss, today noted as finance minister arun jaitley started pre-budget consultations with different stakeholders ahead of his second full-year budget in february. in fact, a joint memorandum by different trade unions, including the sangh affiliate, marked to the finance minister advised the government to “stop the process of labour reforms in the name of ease of doing business”. we oppose the hectic measures of changing labour laws by the central as well as some states, trade union representatives, including from citu, intuc, aituc, hms, aicctu, aiutuc and sewa, said. according to the unions, instead of depending on foreign funds for growth and development of the national economy, the government should concentrate on raising internal resources for funding the developmental schemes and welfare programmes and by taxing those who have capacity to pay instead of drastically reducing the allocations on social sector and basic services like health and education. ; the government must take firm measures to contain deliberate tax-default by the big business and corporate lobby leading to huge accumulation of unpaid direct tax dues, they said. while making strong observations about the bjp government’s economic policy “subsidising the rich and taxing the poor” and “drastic cut to the tune of rs 4.40 lakh crores made in the allocation of funds for social sector schemes” in the budget last year, the bms separately cautioned the government on rising prices, its taxation policy and concessions to corporates. “indirect tax was increased which is borne by the common man and direct tax was reduced which is borne by the high-income group. corporate tax was reduced from 30% to 25%. plethora of concessions and exemptions were given to corporates and big industries.” “fundamental approach to tax collection is, collect tax from the rich and subsidise the poor. but now in the globalised era it has become just the opposite. government is subsidising the rich and taxing the poor. the common man is funding the government through the indirect taxes whereas indian corporates are given all types of concessions and exemptions. consequential revenue losses are reducing the social sector spending. “thus government’s too much romance with corporates is creating colossal loss to the social sector. further, there is deliberate tax-default by the big business and corporate houses leading to huge accumulation of unpaid direct tax dues which has already crossed more than rs 5 lakh crore on direct and corporate tax account alone. their share of npa is rising. forty per cent of foreign debts are commercial loans taken by the corporates. neither the corporate sector is improving their role in national economy nor the social sector is benefitted,” it said. expressing opposition to fdi again, the bms maintained that the idea that fdi was a panacea for all economic maladies has to be discarded. “manufacturing, industrial, agricultural and service sectors have to be strengthened.” “people have voted this government to power for bringing change. hence people need to be convinced about the direction of the change. there is a gross mismatch between the aspirations of the people and the slow progression of social transition. paltry concessions or charity in the budget cannot change the economic condition of the people,” it said.",stop labour reforms name ease biz : unions govt,"vibha sharma new delhi , january 4 government ’ “too much romance corporates creating colossal loss social sector ” , bhartiya mazdoor sangh , labour union affiliated rss , today noted finance minister arun jaitley started pre-budget consultations different stakeholders ahead second full-year budget february. fact , joint memorandum different trade unions , including sangh affiliate , marked finance minister advised government “stop process labour reforms name ease business ” . oppose hectic measures changing labour laws central well states , trade union representatives , including citu , intuc , aituc , hms , aicctu , aiutuc sewa , said. according unions , instead depending foreign funds growth development national economy , government concentrate raising internal resources funding developmental schemes welfare programmes taxing capacity pay instead drastically reducing allocations social sector basic services like health education. ;

companies present here, especially in the field of defence manufacturing that we can do a lot in the area of defence manufacturing.” “we are working towards improving quality of life. we are working on good governance. these are the two initiatives that world is attracted towards,” modi said. india has witnessed 40 per cent increase in foreign direct investments and established itself as an important destination for foreign capital, he said. the prime minister said india’s ranking in the ‘ease of doing business’ has improved by 12 points in a short span of time after his government took over. “the inflow of 40 per cent fdi in short period of time is a proof that the world has recognises india as important destination,” he said. he said there are many opportunities to work on

""with our 'look east' policy evolving into an 'act east' policy, the region has gained even greater salience in our strategic thinking and economic engagement. most of india's foreign trade flows through the sealanes of the indian and the pacific oceans. these lanes also bring us the bulk of our energy – be it oil, gas or coal,"" he said in an interview to a local daily 'the new zealand herald'. mukherjee, who becomes the first president to travel to new zealand, arrived here this morning and was received by officials. he was later accorded a ceremonial reception at the governor general's house, which included a traditional rubbing of nose gently with new zealand governor general sir jerry mateparae.

""one of the big achievements of the last two years has also been to tackle the problem of corruption. to this end, the government has transparently and through an open process, auctioned major public assets such as coal and spectrum,"" he said.

“for the first time in tamil nadu elections, there is an alternative in the form of bjp.” he said the tamil nadu government was corrupt but politicians were not ashamed. “the election this time is not about who will win but who will save tamil nadu,” he remarked. referring to the floods in chennai in december, modi said it was the bharatiya janata party (bjp) cadres who helped the people at the time of the crisis. modi said he was the first indian prime minister to visit jaffna in sri lanka and added that his government would wipe the tears of sri lankan tamils. according to him, 30,000 of the 50,000 houses to be built with indian assistance in sri lanka had been handed over to the tamils there. referring to the release of father alexis prem kumar from taliban’s custody, modi said his sister did not believe when i called her and said: “i am narendra modi speaking.” “i told her that her brother will be back in india in two-and-a-half hours. “this is an example of how a people-friendly government functions,” he said modi said the bjp-run central government was two years old but there was no corruption charge against it. he said his government auctioned spectrum and the money went to the government coffers. today, there was no corruption in mining and supply of coal unlike in the past, he said. “we are taking the nation on the correct path.” the prime minister said since the bjp came to power in new delhi, no chief minister writes a letter to him for urea allocation. all the previous central governments said they were helpless in arresting corruption in urea. “we added neem in urea and hence it is not possible for other chemical companies to use it,” he added. he said the central government also ended corruption in the cooking gas subsidy by directly crediting the subsidy amount into consumers’ bank account. “after we came to power we enabled the poor to open bank accounts. watch: pm modi speaks on #agustawestland scam in hosur(tamil nadu)https://t.co/ftaepgrtop — ani (@ani_news) may 6, 2016 “with the formation of mudhra bank, without security or guarantee small-time businessmen can get loans. as a result of 3.5 crore small businessmen were lent around rs.1.30 lakh crore by mudhra bank,” modi said. modi said he would bring all the central government schemes like stand-up india, start-up india and others to tamil nadu if the bjp was voted to power in the state. according to him, only the indian economy was registering growth. he said the foreign direct investment (fdi) had grown 40 per cent. — ians",involved agustawestland chopper scam punished : modi,"chennai/hosur , may 6 prime minister narendra modi friday promised involved agustawestland chopper scam punished. addressing election rallies chennai hosur town tamil nadu , modi said scandal become public bjp took power new delhi 2014. asking people whether relatives italy , modi said : “i ’ relatives italy. visted italy. ” people italy said corruption chopper deal court punished names involved , said. claiming tamil nadu steeped corruption , modi said bjp alternative two dravidian parties state. ;

2016-05-10,investments through mauritius to be taxed from april 2017,"new delhi, may 10 india will begin imposing capital gains tax on investments routed through mauritius from april next under a revised tax treaty inked today to curb tax evasion and round-tripping of funds -- a move that may have a significant bearing on capital flows from the island nation. besides, a similar amendment is being negotiated to the tax treaty india has with singapore. mauritius and singapore are among the top-most sources of foreign direct investments into india and together also account for a big chunk of total inflows into the country's capital markets. the signing of the protocol with mauritius follows decade-long negotiations. under the amended treaty with mauritius, for two years beginning april 1, 2017, capital gains tax will be imposed at 50 per cent of the prevailing domestic rate. full rate will apply from april 1, 2019, a finance ministry statement said. but this concessional rate would apply to a mauritius resident company that can prove that it has a total expenditure of at least rs 27 lakh in the african island nation and is not a 'shell' company with just a post office address. ; the amendment to the 1983 double taxation avoidance convention (dtac) with mauritius was signed at port louis, mauritius, today. till now the dtac did not provide for taxing capital gains in either of the two nations. revenue secretary hasmukh adhia said similar amendment to tax treaty with singapore is being renegotiated. stating that the singapore pact will be amended on similar lines, economic affairs secretary shaktikanta das said it will provide ""a level-playing field between domestic investors and investors who had unfair advantage when they came through the mauritius route”. adhia said the amendment ""brings about a certainty in taxation matters for foreign investors"" and bring certainty for fiis while also reinforcing india's commitment to oecd-beps initiative. tax experts said the amended treaty provides certainty to foreign investors, but the cost of foreign investment in india will go up. of the total fdi inflows of $29.4 billion in april-december 2015-16, mauritius and singapore accounted for $17 billion of foreign equity investment. at one point of time, the two countries also accounted for nearly two-thirds of overall foreign portfolio inflows into india but the inflows have been declining in the recent past. now, mauritius accounts for nearly 20 per cent (over rs 4.3 lakh crore) while singapore-based fpis have over 11 per cent share (nearly rs 2.5 lakh crore). as per the revised treaty, investments made prior to april 1, 2017, will be protected from new tax provisions. the island nation with just 1.3 million people was the biggest single source of foreign direct investment into india in 2014-15, accounting for about 24 per cent of $24.7 billion foreign direct investment (fdi). singapore accounted for 21 per cent. the three-decade-old taxation treaty, which came into force from april 1, 1983, is said to have been misused by many indian and multinational companies to avoid paying tax or to route illicit funds. “while the amendment does provide certainty to foreign investors especially considering that gaar will be in force next year, it will significantly increase the cost of investment in india for foreign funds,"" said rajesh h gandhi, partner, deloitte haskins & sells llp. the amendment, gandhi added, will provide for a concessional tax rate for two years i.e. gains accrued during 2017-18 and 2018-19, which makes mauritius apparently better than singapore for those two years. kpmg (india) national head for beps & tax dispute resolution rahul k mitra said the mauritius amendment is likely to impact the india-singapore tax treaty in a similar manner, as per the protocol signed between the countries. india has been insisting on review of the treaty since 2006 as it felt a chunk of the funds were not real foreign investment but indians routing cash through the island to avoid domestic taxes, a practice known as ""round tripping"". it wanted to ensure firms in mauritius that invest in india are not just 'shell' and instead have substantial operations in the island, such as paying staff there, before qualifying for treaty terms of getting exemption from payment of capital gains tax in india. mauritius agreed for a review only in june 2011. prime minister narendra modi discussed the treaty on a visit to mauritius in march last year. the dtac till now provided that capital gains on sale of assets in india by companies registered in mauritius can only be taxed in mauritius. while short-term capital gains are taxed at 15 per cent in india, they are exempt in mauritius. so, such companies escape paying taxes in both countries. a large proportion of foreign investment in the stock market comes through companies registered in the indian ocean island nation and are exempted from tax in india under the treaty. — pti",investments mauritius taxed april 2017,"new delhi , may 10 india begin imposing capital gains tax investments routed mauritius april next revised tax treaty inked today curb tax evasion round-tripping funds -- move may significant bearing capital flows island nation. besides , similar amendment negotiated tax treaty india singapore. mauritius singapore among top-most sources foreign direct investments india together also account big chunk total inflows country ' capital markets. signing protocol mauritius follows decade-long negotiations. amended treaty mauritius , two years beginning april 1 , 2017 , capital gains tax imposed 50 per cent prevailing domestic rate. full rate apply april 1 , 2019 , finance ministry statement said. concessional rate would apply mauritius resident company prove total expenditure least rs 27 lakh african island nation ' shell ' company post office address. ;

relations is fast, direction positive and destination clear. germany will always find india as powerful, prepared and capable partner,” modi said at a joint press interaction after holding talks with merkel. following their talks, the two sides also signed 12 mous/agreements in fields like cyber policy, development initiatives, sustainable urban development, continued development of cluster managers and skill development, digitalisation, railway security and promoting vocational training. the two sides also issued a joint statement after modi and merkel held the fourth india-germany intergovernmental consultations (igc). the two leaders underlined their common concern about the threat and global reach of terrorism and extremism while condemning terrorist violence in all its forms and manifestations, the joint statement said. ; “they agreed on the need to take strong measures against all those who encourage, support and finance terrorism, provide sanctuary and safe havens that sustain and support terrorist groups and organisations,” it said. india and germany hailed their closer collaboration in countering these challenges through regular meetings of the joint working group on counter terrorism. they also called for finalisation and adoption of comprehensive convention on international terrorism, it said. making a reference to terrorism, modi said it was a big problem that faces future generations and all forces of humanity must come together to fight the menace. “both our countries will work together to tackle this problem together and cyber security and intelligence sharing is a very important aspect of this cooperation,” he said. modi’s remarks assume significance as they come in the wake of a spate of terror attacks that have struck european countries like germany, france, the uk and sweden recently. the latest terror attack to have rocked europe was at a concert in manchester where a suicide bomber blew himself up, killing 22 people. modi said a comprehensive review of bilateral relations was undertaken during the talks with merkel. “a quantum jump in economic relations can be seen between india and germany and an outcome-oriented momentum can be seen building,” he said. “at the last igc in new delhi, we had set up a fast-track system for german companies to invest in india and that has shown very good results, especially the mittlestand (medium enterprises) companies,” modi told reporters. on her part, merkel said india has proved to be a reliable partner and the two sides have been able to deepen cooperation. modi also made a call for european union (eu) unity and said india would play a positive role in enhancing that through germany. in a major boost to merkel, who has been fighting against secessionist tendencies within the economic bloc since the brexit vote in june last year, the prime minister praised her “strong leadership”. “eu unity, proactiveness and strong relations with other countries is extremely important for global development. we want the eu to become stronger and india will play a positive role towards that through the medium of germany,” modi said. “europe and the world are facing lots of challenges and to fight those, india believes, the world needs the strong leadership of chancellor merkel,” he said. noting that india and germany were “made for each other”, modi highlighted that skills development was a key area of cooperation. germany has set global benchmarks in the field of skill development, which is important for india, modi said. india, with 800 million youth and 65 per cent of the population under the age of 35, will be benefited by skills development that germany can provide, he said. modi said bilateral cooperation will extend to the field of sports and the indian youth can benefit from germany’s strong football training skills. merkel said india and germany had further expanded and deepened the bilateral relationship during modi’s visit. “there has been signing of a number of declarations of intent with 1 billion euros going into development cooperation between the countries,” she told reporters. during their talks, the two leaders also expressed their commitment to strengthen global non-proliferation efforts. germany also backed india’s bid for the nuclear suppliers group (nsg). both countries, that are part of the g4, reaffirmed the urgent need for a comprehensive reform of the un security council, including its expansion in both permanent and non- permanent categories of membership, to make it “more effective, efficient and responsive” to the existing challenges to international peace and security and representative of the contemporary geo-political realities, the statement said. india and germany agreed to continue cooperation towards the common aim of developing climate-friendly, efficient and sustainable solutions for india’s expanding energy needs and other areas of sustainable development, the statement said. the two sides also vowed to strengthen the bilateral cyber relationship as laid out in the joint declaration of intent on german-indian cooperation on cyber policy. “both sides looked forward to a successful conclusion of the work of the un group of governmental experts in the field of information and telecommunications in the context of international security,” the statement said. modi and merkel also underlined their determination to ease bilateral trade and investment. they pointed to the potential of open markets and the importance of investment protection for foreign investors for deepening trade relations and for attracting investments to the mutual benefit of both countries. “they also reaffirmed their strong commitment to the eu- india broad based trade and investment agreement and their commitment to bring about a resumption of the negotiations at the earliest possible date. this would, inter alia, allow to establish provisions for the mutual protection of new foreign investments,” the statement said. the signing ceremony for the mous took place at the chancellery, the office of the german chancellor, between senior indian and german ministers and envoys before

""a company shall be considered as 'owned' by resident indian citizens if more than fifty per cent of the capital in it is directly or beneficially owned by resident indian citizens and/or indian companies, which are ultimately owned and controlled by resident indian citizens. ; ""this implies that the maximum permitted fdi shall be 49 per cent,"" the ministry said. it said the chief executive of an applicant company would be resident indian who is part of the indian group owning and controlling the company or the strategic partner. the indian group will have the right to appoint a majority of the directors or to control the management or policy decisions. in certain extreme circumstances of conflict like war, the government would have the right to acquire control over the intellectual property used and facilities developed pursuant to the strategic partnership, according to the policy. the ministry said any subsequent change in shareholding pattern/ownership of the strategic partner would require prior approval of the defence ministry. according to the framework, to manufacture major defence platforms, the select indian companies will require tie-ups with foreign original equipment manufacturers (oem) for transfer of technology (tot) and assistance in training skilled human resources. ""such partnerships or tie-ups between sp and oem may take the form of joint ventures (jv), equity partnerships, technology-sharing, royalty or any other mutually acceptable arrangement between the companies concerned, subject to the ownership conditions,"" the ministry said. the policy envisages establishment of long-term strategic partnerships with indian defence majors through a transparent and competitive process wherein they would tie up with global oems to seek technology transfers to set up domestic manufacturing infrastructure and supply chains. the ministry said it will issue an expression of interest (eoi) to seek applications from indian private companies for selection of strategic partner in identified segments and a final decision will be made following a transparent process. to facilitate selection of oems, the ministry will implement a process of shortlisting of oems for each segment simultaneously with the process of identifying sps. ""the oem will be jointly responsible along with the sp for certification and quality assurance of the platforms supplied to ministry of defence. it further said: ""as part of the eoi, oems will provide a formal acceptance of their government(s) that necessary licenses to transfer technology will be granted in case the oem is selected as a partner for the sp to manufacture the platforms/equipment in india"". such a commitment may also be supported by inter- governmental agreements to be signed between india and the countries concerned, at the stage of award of contract. the ministry said the contract between the sp and oem will cover provisions for protection of classified information and technology transferred by the oem. the oem will also have to confirm life-cycle support for the platform along with the sp. — pti",def min releases framework sp model ; keeps fdi 49 per cent,"new delhi , may 31 49 per cent fdi cap kept setting ventures strategic partnership model production defence platforms companies control indian entities. according documents released defence ministry wednesday , management applicant companies indian hands majority representation board directors. government last week finalised much-awaited strategic partnership ( sp ) model select private firms roped build military platforms like submarines fighter jets india partnership foreign entities. initially , strategic partners selected four segments — fighter aircraft , helicopters , submarines armoured fighting vehicles/main battle tanks. expected expanded segments later stage.

""then congress and cpm government should say they don't need taxes from that,"" he said. he asked how much tax was opposition ruled state levying. ""you should remember, when oil prices used to be reviewed on fortnightly basis two years ago, government in delhi, haryana, punjab and himachal pradesh used to increase the vat with the same quantum with which petrol prices used to be reduced in the review,"" he said. haryana has been under bjp rule since 2014 and bjp-akali dal alliance was in government in punjab till march this year. delhi and himachal pradesh levy 27 per cent vat on petrol while punjab has 36.04 per cent vat. haryana levies 26.25 per cent vat. the government in june junked 15-year practice of fortnightly revision in rates and moved to daily changes in petrol and diesel in line with international oil movements. on the fuel price hike fuelling inflation, he said the rate of inflation was 10-11 per cent during the government of those people who today are making noise on inflation.

according to moody’s, baa rating is medium-grade and subject to moderate credit risk while the modifier 2 indicates a mid-range ranking. the government and some commentators in india have been pitching hard for a rating upgrade citing the country’s strong economic fundamentals, political stability and a slew of reforms. some of the key reforms that the narendra modi government has initiated include the goods and services tax (gst), demonetisation, aadhaar, bank recapitalisation, the insolvency and bankruptcy code and targeted delivery of benefits through the direct benefit transfer (dbt) system, among others. the other two leading global rating organisations such as fitch and s&p have bbb- rating with a stable outlook. bbb- is just a notch above the junk grade and the lowest in investment ratings. the upgrade signals increasing confidence in the indian economy vis-a-vis china in the international market. in september, s&p global ratings cut china’s long-term sovereign credit rating by one level to ‘a+’ from ‘aa-’. even moody’s in may this year downgraded china to a1 from aa3 and changed outlook to stable from negative. after moody’s action, india is now three notches away from china. with baa2 and a stable outlook, india is behind only china in the brics bloc, moody’s said, adding that india, china and south africa are investment grade sovereigns in the grouping. russia has a ba1 rating, south africa (baa3) and brazil (ba2). foreign investors are expected to see the current action by moody’s as another evidence of a growing indian economy. a rating upgrade usually gives a leg-up to the economy, prompting companies to expand capacity in the country, which also generates more jobs. this is also viewed as a positive sign by investors in stocks, bonds and currency markets, sparking more capital inflows. the factors that rating agencies normally consider while deciding on sovereign ratings include fdi inflows, debt-to-gdp ratio and per capita income of nations, among others. according to moody’s, the average fiscal deficit of the other baa2-rated countries was 4.2 per cent in 2016 and 3.1 per cent in 2017 (forecast). the “median debt: gdp ratio for baa2 countries as against india’s debt:gdp ratio stood at 42.7294:68.9645,” moody’s said. moreover, on a ppp basis, india’s gdp per capita has outstripped the baa-rated median for 19 countries. between 2006 and 2016, this grew by 108 per cent against 74 per cent for all baa-rated medians, it added. pti ",moody ’ action spruces india ’ investment credentials,"new delhi , november 17 sovereign rating upgrade global agency moody ’ put india alongside italy , spain , bulgaria philippines terms investment climate. effect , india become largest economy among baa2-rated sovereigns , according moody ’ s. agency friday upgraded india ’ sovereign credit rating notch ‘baa2 ’ stable outlook gap 13 years , saying reforms would foster sustainable growth. sovereign rating issued national governments barometer country ’ investment climate. gives investors insight level risks , including political , associated investing particular country. ;

""this represents a key shift in the military balance between india and the uk, with india allocating more capabilities to develop its regional resources than the uk in a global context,"" said iiss senior fellow for south asia, rahul roy-chaudhury. the report notes that while india continues to modernise its military capabilities, china “with the world's second-largest defence budget after the us“ remains far ahead with three times india's defence budget at us$ 150.5 billion. ; china's real defence spending increased by nearly 25 per cent in 2016-17, whereas india's rose by just 2.4 per cent. “post-dokalam, india's military balance with china continues to be significantly in china's favour. since 2000, china has built more submarines, destroyers, frigates and corvettes than japan, south korea and india combined. china will continue to dominate the region militarily and seek to challenge the us in the region as well,” roy-chaudhury notes. according to the analysis, the chinese army has over 600,000 more active personnel than india; it has nearly 1,200 tactical aircraft compared to indiaâ€™s 785; and 55 more cruisers, destroyers and frigates than india. the report takes note of the indian government's 'make in india' policy, which aims to strengthen the defence-industrial base through measures such as ""reforming the cap on foreign direct investment"" (fdi) and that the country is one of the top troop contributors to un peacekeeping operations.

2018-08-08,strong indian economy continues to lead global growth: imf,"washington, august 8 india is a source of growth for the global economy for the next few decades and it could be what china was for the world economy, the imf said on wednesday, as it suggested the country to take steps towards more structural reforms. “india now contributes, in purchasing power parity measures, 15 per cent of the growth in the global economy, which is substantial,” ranil salgado, international monetary fund’s mission chief for india, told pti. this is next to only china and the us, he said. salgado said spillovers from india are not that big because it is not a very open economy. “but of total global growth in purchasing power parity (ppp) terms, it’s 15 per cent of total global growth. trading is not as high as china trade levels,” salgado said as the imf executive board released the report of its annual consultations with india. he said the imf views india as a “long-run source of global growth”. ; “india has three decades before it hits the point where the working-age population starts to decline. so that’s a long time. this is india’s window of opportunity in asia. it’s somewhat only a few other asian countries have this,” he said. “for the (next) three decades, it (india) is a source of growth for the global economy and could be even longer. but three decades where india can be almost what china was for the world economy for a while,” salgado said. in its report, the imf executive board has forecast india’s growth to rise to 7.3 per cent in fy2018/19 and 7.5 per cent in fy2019/20, on strengthening investment and robust private consumption. “the indian economy is recovering from the two shocks that started from late 2016: demonetisation and then the kind of implementation issues related to the gst. we see growth recovering. generally, india is benefiting from good macroeconomic policies; stability-oriented policies as well as some important reforms that have been done in recent years,” he said. although there are short-term issues, the imf views that as a long-term major gain for india by implementing a national gst. “it’s something that’s difficult to do. other countries have struggled. in india it’s much more complex because you have 29 states and union territories and you need agreement. i think that was a great achievement,” he said. insolvency and the bankruptcy code is the other big achievement, he said. “we are seeing certain positive steps there and we hope that can continue,” he said. “the third (big achievement) from an economist’s point of view is the inflation targeting framework that you now have in the reserve bank of india, formally adopted in 2016 but informally even earlier. we have seen the benefits of that have lower inflation and inflation expectations,” he said. and then there are some of the key smaller steps like things to improve the business climate, steps to further liberalise fdi. “in the near term, it’s just to make sure that effective implementation of those are ongoing. if you think of the insolvency and bankruptcy code, it’s a difficult change. basically, the underlying system to resolve bad assets from the corporate sector side is something new. it takes time and experience has to be gained. and we’re seeing some of the hitches along the way there, but generally things seem to be moving in the right direction,” the senior imf official said. noting that the government is taking steps to “streamline and simplify” the gst, he said the imf believed that this is important. “overall we’re seeing efforts to improve the balance sheet of banks as well as corporate sector. in our view, these are all important things that need to continue,” he said. salgado said that for india, things are relatively positive. “india has a young population. it has the potential for a demographic dividend of the next three decades,” he said but quickly cautioned that demographic dividend is not automatic. “it takes good policies to create jobs, to create even stronger economic growth. seven to eight per cent growth is very good. it’s one of the best in the world. but for india, which is appropriately aspiring to quickly catch up with the richer advanced countries, you need even stronger growth,” he said in response to a question. “so if you think about china, china had double-digit growth for many years and that’s how we quickly caught out and that’s something we should aspire to as well. because if that doesn’t occur, there is the risk that india could grow old before it becomes rich,” he said, noting that the imf is now suggesting india to take steps towards structural reforms. “the second message we are saying that steps to structural reforms have to continue and, in some ways, have to even take a step further up,” he said identifying labour reforms, improving the business climate, and enhancing infrastructure as key areas for continued reforms. and finally it is important to finish the cleanup of bank and corporate sector balance sheets, he said. pti ",strong indian economy continues lead global growth : imf,"washington , august 8 india source growth global economy next decades could china world economy , imf said wednesday , suggested country take steps towards structural reforms. “india contributes , purchasing power parity measures , 15 per cent growth global economy , substantial , ” ranil salgado , international monetary fund ’ mission chief india , told pti. next china us , said. salgado said spillovers india big open economy. “but total global growth purchasing power parity ( ppp ) terms , ’ 15 per cent total global growth. trading high china trade levels , ” salgado said imf executive board released report annual consultations india. said imf views india “long-run source global growth ” . ;

the decline in global fdi is mainly owing to recent tax reforms implemented by us president donald trump's administration that led to big firms in the us to bring home earnings from abroad – principally from western european countries. other factors have contributed to this year's ""huge difference in repatriation"" of overseas profits by us multinationals, zhan said. these include uncertainty about the detail and impact of tax reform and the potential impact of unresolved international trade disputes;
