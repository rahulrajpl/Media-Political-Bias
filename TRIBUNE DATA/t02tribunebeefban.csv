strategic concern to both the countries.an official announcement on president putins visit was made here by the external affairs ministry spokesman today.the importance which was being attached to the visit of president putin could be gauged from the fact that just three days ahead of the official visit of the russian president, russian defence minister sergei ivanov would be in new delhi to hold crucial talks with defence ministry officials on various accords which would be signed during the visit.india and russia were also working together on the aircraft carrier admiral gorshkov and moscow was keen that new delhi should purchase more equipment from it for the refurbishment of the carrier which would serve as the mainstay of the indian navy in the coming years. the issue of india purchasing more equipment for admiral gorshkov might also come up during the discussions.the russian defence minister was also expected to hold crucial discussions on military and technical cooperation, including working out an agreement to safeguard military technology being jointly developed.the russian defence minister would arrives here on november 30 and would stay on for president putins visit. incidentally, the two countries had together developed the futuristic supersonic cruise missile brahmos, which could be fired from any platform on land, sea or air. the development of the missile was of importance to both the countries and an accord would be signed between them to prevent transfer of technology to any third nation. brahmos, the 300-km multi-faceted missile was a joint venture between new delhi and moscow with each side having a 50 per cent stake.the broader agreement would also cover mutual protection of intellectual property rights on joint weapons projects. moscow had offered india an equity stake in the development of fifth generation fighter aircraft.the russian defence minister, who would be heading a high-level military delegation, would also hold talks with his indian counterpart pranab mukherjee. one of the important points for discussion would be of the russian army officers undergoing training at the high altitude warfare school and undertaking high altitude exercises with indian army.though india had started deploying the brahmos missile in its frontline warships, with its surface to surface and air to ground versions undergoing flight tests, the signing of the agreement, would enable the two countries to explore markets overseas for the missile.according to reports here another issue which was likely to be taken up during the russian presidents visit would be the resolving of the rupee-rouble. russia wanted the issue to be resolved in a mutually-beneficial manner and the pending rupees worth $ 3 billion re-invested on concrete projects either on indian soil or in russia.moscow was keen that india extended its support to russia joining the wto. a document in this regard might be signed during president putins

pakistan petroleum limited's (ppl) installations had come under rocket fire and the company is evacuating its personnel from the area. gun battles have erupted in sui with the insurgents launching an attack on the position of frontier corps and defence security guards. the latest spark, the alleged gangrape of a ppl lady doctor, heightened the tension in the region and the supposedly cover-up of the involvement of certain senior military personnel. president pervez musharraf's warning to the people of balochistan, especially to those who have taken up arms by referring to the 1973-1975 insurgency, has added fuel to the fire and deepened the balochistan crisis. people in baluchistan are angry over the hard talk of general musharraf, who in an interview to a pakistani television, warned the balochis that this was not the 1970s when they could hide in the mountains. in the 1970s, pakistan as a state had just suffered its worst-ever trauma caused by its defeat in east pakistan. an example of secession had been set which was at the back of the minds of those who carried forward the insurgency in baluchistan.the present unrest, according to political observers, is not backed by the separatist rhetoric but has an autonomist underpinning. baloch nationalist leaders in quetta, expressing their anguish over general musharraf's warning to baluchistan tribes to stop attacks on oilfields, have warned that a brutal force cannot suppress national movement. sardar ataullah khan mengal and nawabzada balaach marri have asserted that baloch people would not allow the usurpers to loot the resources of the province and deny the local people's constitutional and political rights. sardar mengal, chief of pakistan oppressed nation movement (ponm), told pakistani daily dawn that political issues were resolved in a political manner but the pakistan president, who belonged to the army establishment, lacked political maturity to realise the results of the language he used in his tv interview. in an obvious rejoinder to gen musharraf's remark, sardar mengal said the baloch people could resist the aggression of the pakistani security forces in a much better way than they did in the seventies. he reminded that the dismemberment of pakistan was an outcome of the use of brutal face by the army against the bengali people.the ponm chief said balochis would not be cowed down by his threats and would resist oppressors to protect the resources and political rights of the people of baluchistan. sardar mengal said that the people of baluchistan had been the target of army and agencies. there would be no compromise on basic issues, which the bnp has already identified at the onset of talks vis-à-vis full autonomy particularly in administration, legislative and financial matters and an end to the centre's interference in provincial affairs. another senior baloch leader, mr akbar bugti, said the gas pipeline from iran to india across pakistan would not be possible without baloch goodwill. the balochis have a long history of neglect and discrimination at the hands of the federal government. they have never been given government jobs and representation in the armed forces proportionate to the balochi population. whenever balochis demand their rights and honourable share in the economic resources, islamabad has sent troops to crush them. from 1973 to 1979, some 15,000 balochi men, women and children were killed by the pakistan army and the frontier corps. this was followed by another operation against the balochis in 2002 when 50,000 para-military troops laid siege to dera bugti and the local population had to live without electricity, water and telephones during the summer months of june and july. the balochis have complained that while the sui gas warms houses in punjab, their own area lacks electricity. the sui gas from dera bugti meets 60 per cent of pakistan gas production mainly for punjab's domestic and natural needs. in spite of this, the people in this province are poor. they have protested against the construction of gwadar port where chinese engineers are working. according to nawab mohammad akbar khan bugti, the gwadar port project is a plan to divide baluchistan and bring destruction, instability and poverty to the baloch people. balochis have also been protesting against the use of their land for nuclear tests. the water level in baluchistan has been falling and fear of drought in the next ten years haunts its people. the pakistan armed forces have not succeeded in quelling rebellion in baluchistan in the four wars (in 1948, 1958-62, 1963-69 and 1973-77) although the process has inflicted lot of loss of life of innocent people besides damage to oil installations. this has only served to embitter the baluchistan further and provide new generations of rebels to take on the centre. the baloch guerrillas fighting on home soil with the support of local people have proven a tough adversary.",news

2005-07-02,india keen on thermonuclear project rajeev sharma ," rajeev sharma new delhi, july 1 as the international community just started fastening the nuts and bolts of the futuristic international thermonuclear experimental reactor (iter) project, india today advocated its case before the european union (eu) for its inclusion in the strategic project.india conveyed its keenness to joint the iter project at the inaugural meeting of the india-eu energy panel at brussels today. the panel was headed on the indian side by foreign secretary shyam saran and on the eu side by mr lamoureux, director-general for energy and transport in the european commission. two days ago, france had won an international competition to be the host of the worlds first nuclear fusion reactor, an estimated $10 billion project that many scientists see as a key to solving the worlds future energy needs.japan, which had lobbied hard for the project, dropped out of the bidding. the six-member consortium, which includes the united states, russia, china, japan, south korea and the european union, agreed in moscow to build the facility in the southern french city of cadarache.the june 28 agreement leaves open the possibility that still more countries may participate in the project. the iter is a futuristic project for alternative source of energy in view of the projections that oil and gas depletion will start in 2030 or 2035. this will force the world to turn to nuclear energy in a big way. most experts agree that because of technical difficulties, renewable energy sources such as wind or solar power will never provide more than 15 per cent or 20 per cent of the worlds energy needs. there is enough coal on the earth to keep the world running for centuries, but at an unacceptable environmental cost. the iter project is based on the nuclear fusion process. under this process, huge amounts of energy are released, as with the sun and stars or, in man-made form, the hydrogen bomb. the process has long been studied as a potential energy source that would be far cleaner than burning fossil fuels or even nuclear fission, which is used in nuclear reactors today but produces dangerous radioactive waste.however, a major scientific challenge before the international scientific community is building a machine that will not melt in the 100 million degree celsius temperature that will be produced inside the reactor.the india-eu energy panel today decided to set up working groups in the areas of: coal and clean coal conversion technologies, energy efficiency and renewable energies, fusion energy, including indias participation in the iter.

of bihar till the formation of the next government after the four phase assembly elections that begin on october 18.mr lalu prasad has reportedly spoken to senior congress leaders camping in chandigarh now on this issue after the court judgement and conveyed his desire to the upa chairperson sonia gandhi.it was reliably learnt that the apprehension of a hung assembly this time, where the bjp-jd(u) coalition is expected to be ahead of others in the number game, prompted mr lalu prasad yadav to stand by mr buta singh in this hour of crisis.sources in the state congress disclosed that it was mr lalu prasad who forced the prime minister to promptly act on the report sent by mr buta singh suggesting the dissolution of the assembly as he feared horse trading by the bjp-jd(u).sources claimed that mr lalu prasad yadav even threatened to withdraw support from the upa if the centre did not act on the governors report.according to sources, mr lalu prasad yadavs basic concern was to derail the effort by the bjp and the jd(u) to form the next government as nitish kumar was close to become the chief minister.it may be noted that the union cabinet met late in the night on may 22 to recommend the proclamation of presidents rule to the president, who was then in moscow, following which presidents rule was imposed here on may 23.it was also learnt from congress sources that the prime minister personally did not approve such a hurried move to recommend the dissolution of the bihar assembly.on his part, mr lalu prasad yadav is now happy of the fact that despite the slap on the upa by the supreme court by describing the dissolution unconstituional, the court has given a go-ahead for the poll.this is the reason why mr lalu prasad yadav welcomed the courts verdict as he apprehended that the revival of the assembly could help nitish kumar to form the next government and in the process he could miss his chance to regain his lost ground as he was expecting in the coming

2005-11-28,india set to market brahmos missile girja shankar kaura ," girja shankar kaura new delhi, november 27 india is set to emerge as a strong player in the more than $30 billion annual global defence market with at least two of its products being set to create waves internationally.in the world of dirty politics which goes along with the arms deals and the murky side of the paybacks involved, india is being aided by two of the worlds most powerful arms manufacturing countries  russia and israel. india is pinning hopes on the supersonic cruise missile brahmos and the advance light helicopter dhruv to make its presence felt in the international market as a serious arms manufacturing player.for, dr a sivathanu pillai, chief controller of the defence research and development organisation (drdo) and chief of the brahmos project, marketing the missile is a task which brings out great inspiration in him. a joint indo-russian production, the missile is far superior to the subsonic missiles which all other countries have around the world and can hit the target at least four times faster than them, he says. talking to a select group of journalists, dr pillai pointed out that brahmos would be ready for market by 2007, the time by which both india and russia would also have put at least 18 satellites in space as part of the glonas project to help the movement and tracking of the supersonic missile.the worlds only supersonic missile is also considered to be superior than the american tomahauk cruise missiles. at a recent meeting between the defence officials of the two countries in moscow recently there was also agreement on allowing india to market the missile as there are already enough inquiries with new delhi with regard to it. dr pillai points out that there is a huge market available in the west asia, far-east, africa and latin america for india to sell these missiles.brahmos aerospace, the indo-russian joint venture based in new delhi, which manufactures the missile in its factory in hyderabad, has been exhibiting the weapon at various international shows, the latest being in thailand last month. india has also made a presentation for brahmos in south africa and chile.in fact, chile could be the first buyer of brahmos and has also shown an interest in dhruv which actually showcases the indo-israeli defence cooperation. the multi-purpose machine, manufactured by hindustan aeronautics ltd (hal) and fitted with avionics from israel aircraft industries (iai), is being aggressively marketed by india and israel under an agreement thats the first of its kind signed by an indian defence organisation.the anti-israel lobby in india may not like it, but the strategy has put india in the international defence market, particularly in latin america, with chile showing the way. chile has a longstanding defence relationship with israel into which india has tapped successfully.we submitted a joint proposal with israel to the government of chile to sell the dhruv helicopter, say ministry of defence (mod) officials here. iai has an office in santiago (chiles capital) through which we work. this happened just last year and the result was the current negotiation to sell 30 choppers.dhruv has attracted international attention for two reasons. one, its probably the only multi-utility helicopter in the market, built for civilian as well as military use. two, at rs 20 crore apiece, it is the cheapest in its class. mauritius, sri lanka, malaysia, and singapore are the other countries that have evinced interest in dhruv.while dhruv may be a certificate of indias growing abilities in defence manufacture, brahmos is a technological breakthrough. based on russian design, and with russian engineering support, the missile has a cent per cent strike rate. it can be fired from a plane, submarine, ship, or land also.russia and india have kept the range of brahmos below 300km, with a maximum warhead weight of 300kg to ensure that it does not violate the missile technology control regime.",india set market brahmos missile girja shankar kaura,"girja shankar kaura new delhi , november 27 india set

2006-07-18,bomb hoax throws mumbai trains out of gear ," mumbai, july 17 a second bomb hoax in three days disrupted train services in mumbai today. according to western and central railway officials an anonymous telephone call warning of a bomb placed at dadar railway station threw services on both networks out of gear for more than an hour this afternoon.train services were halted and commuters asked to leave the premises as the bomb disposal squads searched the railway station and local trains for explosives.services resumed after nothing was found. investigators have done yet another flip-flop saying that rdx was indeed used in the seven bombs that went off in mumbais local trains last tuesday.citing reports received from the forensic science laboratory in hyderabad, k p raghuvanshi, chief of maharashtras anti-terrorist squad, said rdx, ammonium nitrate and fuel oil were all used in the seven bombs. he sought to explain the changing statements saying traces of explosives found at the blast sites were very small in quantity making it difficult for forensic experts to analyse them.heavy rains last tuesday had washed away much of the evidence, investigators say. the mumbai police has now released 50 sketches of blasts suspects based on descriptions by eyewitnesses. these sketches are being circulated at various police stations in mumbai.meanwhile, investigators surmise that the explosives may have all been loaded at churchgate railway station itself with the bombers making their getaway well in time before the devices exploded.all trains in which the bombs went off left churchgate railway station within minutes of each other packed to capacity since they were destined for borivili or virar 35 and 60 km away, respectively.earlier, it was felt that the bombers may have boarded the trains en route and left behind the devices. regular passengers had ridiculed this claim because the trains usually fill up at the starting point itself making it difficult for someone to board and exit the train in minutes. the authorities have set up as many as 14 teams to probe the blasts but with little headway. reports say even suspended police officers like daya nayak have been roped in since they have a good network among the underworld.however a sustained combing operation has resulted in local police stations nabbing several small-time criminals who have been absconding for a long while. the police are on the lookout for muslim youth who may have gone to the gulf countries ostensibly for work but returned after a short stint. with arrested lashkar-e-toiba operatives confessing to have sent several youth to pakistan via the gulf countries for training in bomb making, the focus is on sleepers who may be awaiting orders to strike at the right moment.reports collated from immigration departments indicate that at least a 100 youth may have gone abroad on short stints. slum dwellers, who were picked up in mass interrogation drives in the past two-three days, have been quizzed about people who went abroad for a short while but returned home under some pretext or another. the mumbai police and intelligence officials feel bollywood stars are vulnerable to terrorist attacks, according to sources here.consequently security has been beefed up at major hotels near andheri and juhu in suburban mumbai where prominent bollywood personalities live and work.sources, however, say that no individual personality has been asked to stay away from the limelight. a few top personalities like amitabh bachchan and

imprisonment for shooting three officers in jammu and kashmir (j&k). though none of the officers were killed, one of them was critically injured. the jawan, prashant bhosle from the maratha light

2007-02-02,russia to be in full force at aero india 07 ," new delhi, february 1 faced with increased competition from the usa to remain indias number one defence goods supplier, russia is coming to aero india 07, organised by ficci, countrys biggest ever air show, with full force and an attempt to win the heart of the indian air force (iaf) officials and the contract for the 126 multi-role fighter aircraft, the force is looking to purchase.russias pavilion in bangalore will most likely be centred around the su-30mki (flanker) thrust-vectoring multi-role fighter. importantly, the aeroplane indian and international experts and public will see is expected to come from an iaf base, rather than from moscow, where it was designed, or from irkutsk, where it is produced. su-30mkis have been in service with the iaf for some time and have won a formidable reputation among indias air-combat community. although the initial contract was for the supply of the sukhois till 2017, but recently russian state arms exporter rosoboronexport and the indian defence ministry agreed to reduce the term of the contract to 2014 (and are reportedly thinking of 2012) and shift the manufacturing base back to irkutsk. this is being done as india does not want to invest an estimated $ 8.71 billion in new production equipment. secondly, they want to receive operational aircraft as soon as possible because the air force is a crucial part of the national defence capability and there is already a shortage of fighter aircrafts with the iaf in the wake of the migs being phased out.the su-30mki will not be the only highlight of the russian pavilion at the coming show. another will be the su-35 (also a flanker), widely recognised as a fighter of the future, with a superior low-speed-high, aoa capability and which russia is looking to sell to the iaf.from the very start, the basic idea behind the su-35 was to return to the original aerodynamics of the su-27. (the earlier su-27 derivatives, while more advanced on other counts, were all heavier and therefore less agile than the original). powered by 14,500 kg al-31fs, and carrying the lightest and most compact avionics suite in the family, the su-35 has the best thrust-to-weight ratio (over 15 per cent better than the earlier versions) and, importantly, a 3d thrust vectoring capability, which gives the lighter aircraft a much better climbing rate and acceleration and unrivalled low-speed-high-aoa performance.highly manoeuvrable and digitally automated, the su-35 is single-seated and does not need canard fore planes. thanks to its new electrically powered fly-by-wire system and high-lift flaps, the air brake could be removed (the take-off run/landing roll formula is nonetheless very good, 450/650), freeing more space for the integrated fuel tank and thereby increasing the planes operational range to 3,600 km (which is reduced to 1,580 km if the plane travels at a belowradar altitude at mach 0.7).",russia full force aero india 07,"new delhi , february 1 faced increased competition usa remain indias number one defence goods supplier , russia coming aero india 07 , organised ficci , countrys biggest ever air show , full force attempt win heart indian air force ( iaf ) officials contract 126 multi-role fighter aircraft , force looking purchase.russias pavilion bangalore likely centred around su-30mki ( flanker ) thrust-vectoring multi-role fighter. importantly , aeroplane indian international experts public see expected come iaf base , rather moscow , designed , irkutsk , produced. su-30mkis service iaf time formidable reputation among indias air-combat community. although initial contract supply sukhois till 2017 , recently russian state arms exporter rosoboronexport indian defence ministry agreed reduce term contract 2014 ( reportedly thinking 2012 ) shift manufacturing base back irkutsk. done india want invest estimated $ 8.71 billion new production equipment. secondly , want receive operational aircraft soon possible air force crucial part national defence capability already shortage fighter aircrafts iaf wake migs phased out.the su-30mki highlight russian pavilion coming show. another su-35 ( also flanker ) , widely recognised fighter future , superior low-speed-high , aoa capability russia looking sell iaf.from start , basic idea behind su-35 return original aerodynamics su-27.

2007-03-28,how ltte operates microlight aircraft bombers ipkf had destroyed its factory rajeev sharma ," rajeev sharma new delhi, march 27 the security and strategic establishment here believes that the ltte has reassembled its microlight aircraft arsenal in a big way which can have huge security implications internationally.it was more than two decades ago when the liberation tigers of tamil eelam (ltte) acquired the capability of using microlight aircraft as flying bombs on enemy targets -- much before the unitted states experienced 9/11. the indian peace keeping force (ipkf) had unearthed and destroyed a ltte factory to manufacture microlight aircraft nearly two decades ago . key ltte leader, shankar, was instrumental in pioneering the technology for his outfit.yesterdays bombing of sri lankan army base in colombo by ltte cadres using microlight aircraft will inevitably force security establishments in the region to review aerial security of offices and residences of vvips and strategic installations.here is how the ltte prepares its cadres for microlight aircraft attacks. a very thin suicide bomber, who is made to undergo dieting to further shed his weight, is entrusted with the mission. the thinner the pilot, the more explosives the plane can take. the pilot can be asked to put on the minimum possible clothes, preferably just an underwear. he has to die anyway, that is the logic.a microlight aircraft can be turned into a lethal flying bomb and can carry upto twenty kg of explosives. considering that a microlight aircraft can easily cover a distance of 500 km, its lethal potential can be well imagined. once a microlight aircraft takes off, its engine can be switched off to save fuel. it becomes like a glider and floats in the air using favourable wind currents. its fibreglass body enables it to cover longer distance.the news of the ltte acquiring manufacturing knowhow of microlight aircraft first leaked in the early nineties. sri lankan as well as indian governments responded by introducing zero-tolerance, no-fly zones and deploying anti-aircraft guns to beef up aerial security of key installations.an important point to be noted here is that yesterdays attack by the ltte used two light aircraft and it was not a suicide operation. the pilots managed to return after bombarding the sri lankan military base near colombo. a point to be considered is what can happen if the ltte were to use microlight aircraft on a suicide mission.yesterdays development, the first in two decades in the island nations ethnic conflict history, is yet another demonstration of the fact that the peace talks between the ltte and the sri lankan government are over. it is also a technology and capability demonstrator from the ltte to the lankan government that it can do much worse.",ltte operates microlight aircraft bombers ipkf destroyed factory rajeev sharma,"rajeev sharma new delhi , march 27 security strategic establishment believes ltte

2007-07-02,1971 war us pleaded with china to menace india," new delhi, july 1 the recently declassified us official records throw new light on the anger and frustration that seized us president richard nixon during the 1971 indo-pak war and how washington secretly pleaded with china to menace india by moving troops to the indian border. poring over thousands of pages of national security files and telephone transcripts of the then us national security adviser henry kissinger and 2,800 hours of nixon tapes, well-known american author and historian robert dallek recalls the events in the white house during the december of 1971 in a just-published book nixon and kissinger-partners in power. nixons infamous tilt towards pakistan is well known but the author reveals many other facets of how nixon and kissinger were upset with india and how they tried to rope in china in a bid to prevent the formation of bangladesh. nixon describes indians as a slippery, treacherous people and his national security adviser calls the indians insufferably arrogant. the story began in the fall of 1971, when differences in the administration and the country over the white house china policy posed little threat to a major transformation in sino-american relations. a larger danger to rapprochement with peking and detente with moscow came from rising tensions in south asia. long standing tensions between the punjabis, who dominated the central government in west pakistan, and the bengalis in the east now had erupted into a full-scale crisis. the president and kissinger had less interest in what the indians or pakistanis did to each other than in assuring that nothing sidetracked kissingers trip to china and the revolution in sino-american relations. in july, on his way to peking, kissinger discussed the crisis with pakistani and indian officials in islamabad and new delhi. kissingers meetings with the pakistanis were cordial, but, predictably, the indians complained that us support of pakistan was encouraging a ""policy of adventurism,"" which china was also promoting. indira gandhi saw little chance of a political settlement. she did not want to use force and was open to suggestions. kissinger warned india that a war would be a disaster for both countries and the sub-continent would become an area for conflict among outside powers. kissinger recalls returning from his trip with ""a premonition of disaster"". he expected india to attack pakistan after the monsoon. he feared that china might then intervene on pakistan's behalf, which would move moscow ""to teach peking a lesson"". but a message from the soviets assured washington that india had no intention of attacking west pakistan and that ceasefire discussions were under way. to their surprise and relief, the us got a chinese message that said nothing about moving troops to the indian border. instead, appreciating that independence for east pakistan was a foregone conclusion, peking said it was prepared to endorse an american un proposal for a standstill cease-fire and forgo a demand for mutual troop withdrawals. the crisis now petered to a conclusion. between december 14 and 17, indian forces completed their conquest of east pakistan and agreed to a ceasefire in the west with no occupation of additional pakistani territory. although nixon and kissinger put the best possible face on the outcome, the result of the war was essentially a victory for india and its soviet ally, which declared the emergence of bangladesh from the ruins of east pakistan a triumph for socialist and democratic principles, the book recalls.  pti ",1971 war us pleaded china menace india,"new delhi , july 1 recently declassified us official records throw new light anger frustration

respect of the $ 1.5-billion contract to modernise adm gorskhkov, an aircraft carrier that india purchased from russia in 2004. a resolution of this issue during the singh-putin talks might be an important breakthrough thus reducing the irritants in the india-russia relationship. to set at rest russian concerns, the prime minister will assure putin that russia will continue to be india's most important partner in defence cooperation despite the us and israel being important suppliers of military hardware to india. a bilateral agreement enabling russia to build four additional power reactors at the kudankulam plant in tamil nadu is being firmed up. a protocol of intent for this was signed during putin's visit to india in january this year when he was the the chief guest at the

of the people for ethical treatment of animals (peta), a non-profit organisation crusading for the rights of animals.the organisation founded in india almost eight years back wants its staffers to practice what they preach. although staffers are not required to give any formal undertaking promising adherence to a vegan lifestyle, they are not allowed to bring leather bags to office or walk into the office wearing leather shoes. use of milk in tea or coffee is not allowed.staffers can use either soya milk or non-dairy creamer (coffeemate) from nestle. or else, they can settle for black coffee or tea. the same rules apply to visitors.visitors to the peta office carrying a leather briefcase or a bag are persuaded to spare three minutes to watch an audio visual on how leather is made in india.such a work culture may sound rather difficult but in doing so, peta may in the long run contribute to reducing indias disease burden. peta points out that the consumption of dairy and dairy products can cause cancer, diabetes, osteoporosis, cardio vascular diseases and lactose intolerance.while arguing against the intake of dairy milk, peta sources drew attention to the opinion of none other than dr john mcdougall, world renowned health adviser to former us president bill clinton. dr mcdougall calls animal milk liquid meat because it as bad for human-beings as meat. anuradha

from my heart?the simple reason we want our staffers to lead a vegan lifestyle is because veganism is our largest campaign. a vegan is someone who is a vegetarian and does not even take dairy products.the peta chief functionary said, when people appear for an interview, we tell them frankly that if they are representing peta, they cannot sit at a table and eat meat. they cannot be abusing animals and asking people to give up a non-vegetarian diet and discontinue wearing leather.peta persuades job seekers to its office to adopt a vegan lifestyle by showing them three

peta country head explained, peta investigations have shown that cows and buffaloes are administered painful injections of the banned drug oxytocin twice a day to increase the milk yield. in some villages, farmers poke sharp sticks into the cows uterus in the belief that such cruelty would increase milk. cows are impregnated and milked over and over until they are too worn out to produce any

2008-02-11,russian pms visit: n-deal tops agenda rajeev sharma ," rajeev sharma new delhi, february 10 an indo-russian civilian nuclear energy cooperation agreement has been finalised and the text is frozen, diplomatic sources said today.the nuclear deal, which is on the lines of similar arrangements with the united states and france, will come up under laser beam focus during russian prime minister victor a. zubkovs talks with prime minister manmohan singh at hyderabad house here on february 12. the catch, however, is that the indo-russian nuclear deal would be signed only after india crosses the camels hump by getting the mandatory nod from two world bodies - the iaea and the nuclear suppliers group (nsg). the fifth and last round of india-iaea negotiations is expected to be over very soon after which the nuclear deal would be tossed before the upa-left panel.it will have to be seen how the left responds to the final text of india-specific safeguards agreement with the iaea. it will have to be seen how the upa government, which has invested a lot of political capital in the indo-us nuclear deal, tackles the issue if the left parties continue to oppose the operationalisation of the deal.us ambassador to india david c. mulford has already gone on record saying that it is now or never for the indo-us nuclear deal.india and russia are expected to sign five agreements during zubkovs visit (february 12-13), including three major ones in the aviation and telecom sectors.two ticklish issues that have plagued indo-russian bilateral relations -

sahebkhali in sundarbans, become busy with trains of cattle being herded on a secret journey culminating in bangladesh where they will be slaughtered for shipment as processed beef.the border at chanralkhali village here on the bank of kalindi river which separates bangladesh and india has been a witness to the smuggling of truckloads of cattle from gujarat, rajasthan, punjab, haryana, uttar pradesh and bihar for some time now.ever since cyclone aila devastated the deltas and hit the border security force (bsf) by damaging patrolling boats and breaching embankments and roads, there has been a manifold increase in smuggling aided by hapless villagers.a recent spate in smuggling by villagers has put bsf jawans on high alert, says a jawan on duty at the border village, 100 km from kolkata.the cyclone has destroyed all means of livelihood for 1.6 lakh people of hingalganj by damaging houses and rendering fields saline. sights of devastation are evident everywhere.bsf jawans say smugglers have taken advantage of the situation by engaging hapless villagers into smuggling cattle, bidi, garments and drugs at night.normally, the smugglers pay us rs 200 for transporting cattle from one village to another. with more people offering to do so smugglers have cut the rates and are now paying half the amount, says ramesh mondal, a resident of chanralkhali village.most smuggling of cattle takes place at night usually in large boats deep inside the sundarbans mangrove jungle which borders bangladesh.attempts to smuggle goods by villagers have gone up considerably since the

protects the border in sundarbans told pti.the cyclone also killed cattle in the region and the remaining were sold to the smugglers by villagers to feed themselves. risking their lives, villagers have been guiding cattle through water-filled fields and pushing them into the ebbing kalindi river to send them to bangladesh. the smugglers got a free hand until the boats of bsf and roads were repaired.jawans say the growing smuggling has put a lot of pressure on them from their top brass. chandra said bsf takes firm action if anybody was found to be involved in the crime.three jawans were dismissed from service this year on similar charges. we have a system of cross-checking where if hundreds of cattle hoof marks are noticed on the bank of the river, the jawan on duty is asked to explain and if he fails to do so it results in suspension, says chandra.the bsf has so far seized 4,169 cattle, 1,451 pieces of clothing, 3,550 packets of fertilisers and 2,543 bottles of a medicine, phensidyl which people in bangladesh consume to get drunk.revenue worth rs 12 crore has come from cattle auctioning this year, bsf officials said. villagers say the cattle smuggling has affected their lone source of livelihood of catching fish from the stagnant water of the fields.the cattle tears the fishing nets cast in the fields at night, sushanta roy, a villager, says. the vigilance along the embankments and village roads has been intensified after the roads and boats were repaired, bsfs chandra says.maintaining vigilance on the border divided by tidal rivers is tough as it is

was not a planned destruction but a ""spontaneous decision"" taken by the karsevaks.international president of the vhp, ashok singhal told reporters that people had gone there for the construction of a ram temple on our plot of 2.77 acres of land away from the disputed structure.there was no choice for the people since there was no court verdict (which was not delivered as expected). when they could not construct they chose to demolish. it was a spontaneous decision (and) nobody expected the demolition to be completed in five hours as the 16th century building came down in five hours.

rahul gandhi earlier this year had said had anyone from his family been at the helm of affairs at that time, the mosque would not have been demolished. the opposition is targeting the government for the clean chit being given to rao in the liberhan report with the bjp and the sp speaking in the same voice on the issue. this was evident with the samajwadi party going hammer and tongs against congress over the report, saying the party then led by rao failed to prevent the developments which ultimately led to the masjid's demolition. the bjp is also pointing to the denial of ticket by

incentives. since 2005, more than 319 rebels, including some zonal commanders, and dalam commanders of the so-called peoples liberation army have accepted the rehab package, according to ramanand.

125-year-old party together, it appears to have lost the plot in most of the bigger states, losing ground to one regional party or the other. it needs to re-invent itself to remain relevant, discover the tribune correspondents. miles to go: a pensive congress president at the party plenary on sunday imperatives of coalition politics at the centre need not deter congressmen in the states from dreaming big. it was an intriguing message sent out on sunday by congress leaders from the party's 83rd plenary session on the outskirts of new delhi. could it mean that state units would be free to forge regional and opportunistic alliances with smaller and regional parties ? or was it meant to convey that come what may, the party would revive and re-invent itself and go it alone ?it is often difficult for a national party to reconcile regional aspirations and ambition. while congress leaders in andhra pradesh may find all the justification to concede the demand for a separate telangana, it is difficult for the congress to take any decision in haste due to its possible repercussions elsewhere. a national party must perforce put the interests of the country above everything else. but while the congress gropes for a way forward and seeks to get its act together, it does need to reflect on its role in the states where it is not in power. a lack of clarity and an aversion to take up and uphold both just causes and national interest have led to a loss of credibility from which it is finding difficult to recover.in tamil nadu, the congress is content to play second fiddle. since the congress lost power in tn in the wake of anti-hindi agitations spearheaded by the dmk, it has not been able to regain its lost ground. besides the lack of a charismatic leader in the state and factional feuds, the party had lost touch with regional sentiments due to the wide gap between the people and party leaders. while congress leaders often hail former aicc president k kamaraj as the model for congress rule and promise to revive his memory, they gloss over the fact that kamaraj spent the final days of his life, fighting indira gandhi. none of the leaders who were close to kamaraj is associated with the present congress party. but a large section of people in tamil nadu had great admiration for indira gandhi. her twenty-point programme, her image as a great leader who strengthened indian defence, economy, science and technology and the country's image in the international arena, is still recalled by people. she is also remembered as a kind mother who appreciated the sentiments of tamil people and her sri lankan tamil policy is still admired even by strong opponents of the congress. but the failure to recall prime minister manmohan singh's association with indira gandhi and to claim the rightful legacy of the latter is one of the reasons for the decline of the party in the state.the attitude of the central leadership which sacrificed the interests of the party in tamil nadu to increase its lok sabha tally, also contributed to demoralisation among party cadres. when the dmk split in 1972, congress leaders were hopeful of staging a comeback in tamil nadu. however, the split and the formation of the aiadmk pushed the congress to the third place, with a vote share of around 20 per cent. since then, the party is using this vote share to align with one of the dravidian parties, who are content to allocate most of the lok sabha seats to the congress and in return, retain most of the assembly seats for themselves. however, when it formed an alliance with jayalalithaa's aiadmk in 1991, it accepted one-third of assembly seats again. jayalalithaa was catapulted to power with a thumping majority, following a sympathy wave following the assassination of rajiv gandhi. the congress is also seen to be supporting karnataka or kerala in the cauvery and mullaiperiyar water disputes. even as the dmk continued in the upa cabinet which was accused by tamil groups of supporting mahinda rajapaksa's genocidal government, it managed to neutralise people's anger by claiming to to be opposed to the centre's policies and decisions. it was the congress, however, which suffered. the party secured over 14 per cent votes in the 2009 elections. this vote share is sufficient for it to cause a major swing. so, both the aiadmk and dmk are eager to have an alliance with it. the minorities and sc communities are with the congress still. but, the upper caste voters are with the aiadmk now, while the bc votes, which form the majority in tamil nadu, are split between the aiadmk and dmk. but the party no longer has an identity of its own. its stand on most of the issues affecting the people's mind are not known. similarly, in maharashtra the party is unable to take advantage of a splintered opposition. the bjp-shiv sena alliance is frayed and the split in the sena has hurt the alliance. the ncp remains a regional force. but still, the congress has made no headway.in fact in the just concluded elections to the kalyan-dombivli municipality raj thackeray's mns took the second place after the shiv sena-bjp despite the congress contesting in alliance with the ncp. power struggles within the party continue to weaken the party.prithviraj chavan who replaced ashok chavan as maharashtra's chief minister in the wake of the adarsh housing society scandal, is seen by his colleagues in the state congress party as an import from delhi with a tenuous hold in state politics.chavan's assumption of the top job was clearly inauspicious. ajit pawar, the ambitious nephew of nationalist congress party supreme sharad pawar, pushed his way to the post of deputy chief minister.the new chief minister has had to yield some ground within weeks of taking over. noted social worker anna hazare forced him to set up a commission to probe the setting up of the lavasa hill station nearpune. with sharad pawar being the main backer of lavasa, chavan's political survival entirely depends on how the commission goes ahead with the job.though he is seen as a clean politician, chavan is not immune to the pressures of leading a national party in a major state like maharashtra. over the years maharashtra has emerged as a major contributor to the congress party's finances and this has put successive chief ministers at the mercy of the powerful builders' lobby.chavan, like his predecessors , continues to hold the urban development portfolio seen as a cash cow in a state whose cities are undergoing rapid development. within weeks of taking over , prithviraj chavan's government overrode objections from urban town planners and other experts to award a bonanza to builders in mumbai's suburbs. by paying a token fee, developers in suburban mumbai were allowed 33 percent more area to build upon. the bonanza for builders is estimated at several thousand crore rupees in the current financial year alone.in bihar, the party has never been able to recover since its failure to stop the infamous bhagalpur riots in 1989, which was accentuated by its failure to take resolute action against the culprits. its strength in the state assembly sunk this year to an all-time low with just four of its candidates managing to win in the house with a strength of 243. although bihar elects 40 members of the lok sabha, congress has just two seats from bihar.a further nail in the congress coffin was driven by the emergence of lalu yadav and his slogan of social justice. the demolition of the babri mosque alienated the muslims and completed the isolation of the congress in the state. gradually the congress came to depend so much on lalu's popularity for its electoral prospects that it was branded as a 'b'team of rjd. the party was content with that status till the last lok sabha elections when lalu and his new found ally ram vilas paswan decided to push it further down to the status of their 'c' team. finding no other alternative, the congress decided to contest all the 40 lok sabha seats. but it could not find suitable candidates for all the seats, forcing it to fall back on discredited politicians having criminal antecedence like sadhu yadav and pappu yadav. even that did not help because of infighting and with virtually no organisation at the grassroots.uttar pradesh was once the pocket borough of the congress and the nehru-gandhi family. but despite nursing of their own constituencies by sonia and rahul gandhi, and frequent visits by them to the state, party leaders were forced to concede that it indeed has no 'mission 2012' for up, a tacit admission that it has given up hopes of putting up a fight in the assembly election.the much-publicised first transparent election to choose the president of the central region of the youth congress took a lot of time and energy. tarun patel made history in more ways than one- he was elected in a long drawn election and then suspended soon thereafter for indiscipline when he got locks in the youth congress office broken to make room for his new team. the ambitious statewide yatras announced to commemorate the 125th anniversary of the congress also turned into a major embarassment. scheduled across the state, covering every assembly segment, they were meant to remind the people of the state's contribution to the first war of independence and the freedom movement. they were also meant to resurrect unsung local heroes. however, the yatras flagged off with much fanfare by aicc general secretary rahul gandhi on april 14 never really took off and had to be cut short or abandoned mid way. first it got embroiled in controversies in several places as district level leaders engaged nautch girls and other hired entertainers to attract and retain crowds in the sweltering heat. obviously this did not go down well with the senior leaders. finally the yatras were cut short. the second phase in november also failed to arouse much interest and were cut short as congress leaders scrambled to explain that people were busy with the panchayat elections and the wedding season. the grand public rally to be addressed by the congress president sonia gandhi in allahabad to mark the culmination of the yatras also remained a non event, coming as it did on november 25, a day after the party's debacle in bihar. the result of the two by polls to the assembly seats of nidhauli kalan in etah and lakhimpur khiri in november, therefore, came as no surprise. in both the places the congress candidates lost their deposits, coming third and fourth respectively. such examples from other states, specially the bigger states, can be multiplied to highlight the plight of the grand,old dame.it would be a pity though if a great institution with a glorious past flounders. the country needs a strong, liberal, secular and nationalist party, in power or in opposition.it is time for congress leaders to rise to the occasion and put their house in order. nelson

tiger, south china tiger and the grey wolves in china, russia, japan and norway in the past. photos by: s chandan and amit kanwar ","centre stage monkey business monkeys , leopards wild animals fast

2011-06-30,holy cow! now a kit to ensure better milk yield vibha sharma/tns," vibha sharma/tns new delhi, june 29 scientists have developed a unique parentage-verification kit for indigenous and crossbred cattle. the kit is expected to help breeders select genetically superior male under normal field conditions and in turn ensure better progeny and increased milk yield.the dna marker-based parentage verification system has been developed by the national bureau of animal genetic resources (nbagr), karnal, which recently came out with an interesting study. it says indian cow and buffalo breeds possess a rich a2 allele gene that provides a better and healthier quality of milk than foreign breeds.according to nbagr director bk joshi, this is the first time a parentage-verification kit has been developed for indian cattle.explaining the technique, joshi says parentage testing is achieved by detecting certain markers. any attribute that can be easily detected and its inheritance traced can serve as a marker. parentage and paternity testing relies on two basic principles, detection of genetically inherited markers that remain the same throughout the animals life, and on the knowledge that all animals possess two copies of a gene (or marker), one of which was inherited from the sire (father) and the other from the dam (mother).joshi says while milk production is a sex-limited trait, genes for milk production are present in both sexes. milk potential of a cow is determined by the amount of milk it gives. the milk yield of a sire can be determined indirectly by the milk yield of its mother and or that of its female offspring. the animal husbandry practices require the production of a large number of female offspring of one bull through artificial insemination. the breeding value or expected milk yield of the bull is determined by the parentage or paternity-confirmed female offspring, he adds.the process of dna marker-based parentage verification requires dna to be extracted from a tissue sample, preferably blood. the efficacy of the buffalo kit has been tested on 10,000 buffaloes and has given consistent results, joshi says.the cost per sample will be in the range of rs 250-rs 300 per sample, while such imported kits cost around $ 140 per family. moreover, imported kits are viable only for foreign breeds.led by ramesh kumar vijh, principal scientist under the naip research project on identification of markers for milk yield, fat and protein percentage in buffaloes, the team includes priyanka banerjee, jyoti joshi and upasna sharma, bina mishra and ms tantia.

2011-07-31,"sukhois to get closer to pakistan border to be stationed at halwara air base, 150 km away from frontier, by year-end ajay banerjee/tns"," ajay banerjee/tns new delhi, july 30 for the first time, indias frontline fighter aircraft, sukhoi-30-mki, will be based very close to the indo-pak border, only around 150 km away, at halwara, near ludhiana.sources in the iaf said the runway reconstruction at the halwara airbase was nearing completion and the first squadron of the sukhois would move there by the end of the year or at best early next year.the twin-engined russian-origin sukhois, which are now produced under licence in india, are one of the leading warplanes of the world. these are set to become deadlier with the slated fitting of super-sonic cruise missile brahmos under its belly.a sukhoi-30-mki flying at top speed of around two mach, about 2,450 kmph, will be able to reach the western border of india within 4 minutes of the take-off from halwara.the original plan was to have sukhois at halwara at the start of this year itself, however, it was held back due to the runway reconstruction project. the stationing of the warplane is significant as it can travel up to 5,200 km in one go and carry around 8,000 kgs of weaponry. as part of the beefing up of operations in eastern india, some sukhois have been stationed at chabua and tezpur.the warplane will provide additional capability to the iaf, which has a sukhoi-30-mki base at bareilly in western uttar pradesh.over the past few months, the entire lot of 62 russian-built mig-29s has been deployed at adampur, near jalandhar. all three squadrons, around 62 fighters, are now based at adampur which is nations second largest iaf base and had mig 29s for long. now all the mig 29s from across gujarat have been moved to adampur, around 100 km away from the indo-pak border and less than 250 km from the chinese border on the eastern side. the mig 29s are under the process of being upgraded to carry better weapons, a state-of-the-art radar and advanced avionics.another important addition would be midair re-fuelling capability. a more powerful and latest series-iii version of the existing rd 33 engine of the mig 29 will be housed in the upgraded planes. a multi-functional radar will guide weapons with better precision. it will also enable the pilot to see even small targets like unmanned aerial vehicles (uavs). a new weapon-control system will enable better targeting of aims and also upgrade the weapon delivery system. the existing flying range of the mig-29 is around 2,100 km. post add-ons, it will go up to 3,500 km.after the upgrade, the mig-29s, inducted in the late 1980s, will be just a shade lower than the sukhoi-30-mki in strike capability.meanwhile, the iaf has launched a major drive to fill vacancies of pilots. as per latest figures, the iaf has a shortage of 1,016 officers out of which 400 are the vacancies of pilots. the iaf has a sanctioned strength of 12,211 officers. it will be adding newer warplanes in the next 6 to 8 years as the supply of the 126 mmrca fighter planes will start while the supply of the fifth generation fighter aircraft (fgfa) is expected to commence in 2019. the warplane will provide additional capability to the iaf, which has a sukhoi-30-mki base at bareilly in western upn the twin-engined russian-origin sukhois are one of

""the days of persecution under the atheist soviet government was over in 1988,"" goswami said. soon, in 1990, moscow authorities provided iskcon a semi-dilapidated building at begovaya for a temple, which was later demolished in 2004 leading to the allotment of an alternative land for the moscow vedic centre.""the alternative land in lieu of the demolished temple came about in 2006, when moscow's mayor and the delhi chief minister had signed a joint declaration in this regard,"" said goswami. a year later, the moscow administration issued the necessary orders for the construction of the moscow vedic centre.  ians","facing ' ban gita ' case , hindus build krishna temple moscow","new delhi , december 25 hindus krishna devotees may fighting court battle siberian city tomsk move ban bhagavad gita , 40-year quest find foothold russia taking shape construction massive temple moscow ' outskirts.the moscow vedic centre , temple devoted krishna called , coming five-acre land verskino village molzhaninovsky , close sheremetyevo international airport , bhakti vijnana goswami , russian iskcon monk visiting india , told ians here.the moscow vedic centre replacement original krishna temple acted centre iskcon international society krishna consciousness today spread 80 cities russia 50,000 active devotees.the original temple , goswami said , demolished 2004 moscow city government came way new apartment building.to compensate demolished temple , moscow administration provided iskcon alternative plot land leningradsky avenue , temple functions temporarily till moves moscow vedic centre late 2012.

''our fear is that if she leaves, priceless artefacts would be removed from the trust premises and russia will be blamed for the theft,'' the sources added. the actions of the local authorities were objectionable and unacceptable, fraught with undermining russia's civilisational values and aimed at provoking a scandal of bilateral and international dimensions. underlining that the issue was as sensitive and emotive for the russians as the recent controversy over the bhagvad gita in russia was for the indians, the sources said the unhealthy developments at the irmt were expected to be raised in the russian duma (parliament) after the 'victory day' celebrations on may 9. the sources emphasised the genuine international and civilisational character of the irmt's legacy saying, ""it does not belong to naggar or kullu or himachal pradesh, not even to india or russia. it belongs to mankind and cannot be administered by a district administration. this indisputable fact should be kept in mind while dealing with all matters pertaining to the irmt.""

and has, for long, been the author of sonia gandhis hindi speeches. former prime minister atal bihari vajpayee once created waves when he addressed the un general assembly in hindi, perhaps the first by an indian leader. gujarat chief minister narendra modis arrival in mumbai for the bjps national executive meeting last week was preceded by prolonged behind-the-scene efforts to persuade him to attend the party conclave. when senior party leaders like arun jaitley and bjp president nitin gadkari failed in their efforts, the help of intermediaries was sought. according to the mumbai grapevine, london-based businessman anshuman mishra, who was recently in the news in connection with the jharkhand rajya sabha elections, was asked to use his contacts to convince modi. mishra, it is learnt, got in touch with a gujarat-based businessman known for his proximity to modi, who worked on the cm to change his mind. modi, however, extracted a price for his participation: the removal of his bete noire sanjay joshi from the national executive. for the past several weeks, minister of state for parliamentary affairs rajiv shukla, who is also involved with cricket administration, had been boasting to mediapersons that for the first time since its inception, the ipl cricket tournament had not hit the headlines and had instead remained confined to the sports pages. as it happens, he was proved wrong as the ipl tournament was soon on page one and for all the wrong reasons. bollywood superstar and team owner shahrukh khan got into an ugly spat with the officers of the mumbai

the signing of an accord between the two countries on kudankulam-iii and iv units may emerge as the biggest takeaway from putins visit. moscow also expects that by the time the russian president arrives in india, the protests against kudankulam-i and ii units will end. the two countries are also seeking to resolve their differences over indias civil nuclear law, particularly on the liability clause. russia says the new law should not apply to kudankulam-iii and iv units since an understanding on setting up these plants had been reached much before the indian law was passed. but india says it cant make any distinction between russia and its other partners in the field of nuclear energy. the argument being advanced by new delhi is that any exception made in the case of russia will spur

2012-10-11,russia puts off gorshkov delivery till 2013-end ," new delhi, october 10 the indian plan to provide its navy with two seaborne aircraft carriers has been delayed by a year. russia today informed india that admiral gorshkov, indias second carrier, cannot be delivered till the 2013-end due a malfunction in its propulsion system and boilers. india has been pressing for early delivery of the carrier, side-stepping questions if it could evoke the penalty clause for delay.defence minister ak antony and his russian counterpart anatoly serdyukov met in new delhi today for the 12th annual meeting of the india-russia inter-governmental commission on military technical cooperation where the matter of delay in the delivery of gorshkov was discussed. the 45,000-tonne carrier was scheduled to be delivered on december 4 this year. during the july-sept sea trials in the barents sea, a malfunction was detected in its boilers which is now causing the delay. the gorshkov is being refitted at a cost of $2.3 billion for the indian navy that already operates seaborne aircraft carrier ins viraat.serdyukov said, we have given a revised time table, sea trials shall resume in april next year. we believe the transfer (of the ship) will take place in the fourth quarter of 2013. at present the ship is back in the shipyard at severodvinsk, an inspection is being carried out and the reason for the malfunction was being examined. we will work a detail schedule for elimination of the malfunction, the russian defence minister said.the indian side made its stand clear that it was not evoking the penalty clause, but hinted that it could be considered. antony, in response to a question on the penalty clause, said: we are not discussing these issues now. will be considered at latter stage, if necessary.he went on to add: early delivery of the gorshkov is an important concern of the indian government and the navy. we have conveyed serious concern.the russian side said

meeting. we are looking at stepping up the intensity of the naval exercise, serdyukov added.the russian minister dismissed the talk that his visit scheduled for october 4 was postponed due to the moscow-visit of the pakistan army chief gen ashraf parvez kayani. i have already apologised (for that). the only reason was a new project had cropped up, he added. asked if russia would be supplying

soft-spoken politician will be remembered primarily for his keen interest in protecting and promoting indias external interests and the eponymous gujral doctrine ik gujral was indias 12th pm for 11 months in 1997-98. but the mild-mannered, soft-spoken politician will be remembered primarily for his keen interest in protecting and promoting indias external interests and the eponymous gujral doctrine new delhi, november 30 inder kumar gujral was a rare breed of political persona who switched roles seamlessly from a practitioner of diplomacy to the rough and tumble of politics that took him to the pinnacle of political power as the prime minister of india.for someone born in a family of congress workers at jhelum, now in pakistan on december 4, 1919, gujral's early political thoughts were influenced by the communist, worked closely with prime minister indira gandhi in the middle and drifted towards socialists in the end. gujral's family was among the thousands that crossed over to india from pakistan post-partition, and in his autobiography matters of discretion', the former prime minister dwelt at length speaking nostalgically of his childhood days in jhelum in west punjab and the pangs of separation.it is perhaps the umbilical ties with undivided punjab that drove the process to take india-pakistan relations on a different plane. in fact, a few months before he was chosen by the janata dal to lead the united front government at the centre, the then pakistan premier nawaz sharief had commented that india never had a prime minister from punjab.gujral began his career in politics as a student leader. he was arrested in 1942 and jailed for his involvement in the quit india movement. gujral got elected first to the electoral college of delhi and served as the vice president of new delhi municipal council. at the end of the tenure in 1964, he was elected to the rajya sabha where he served two consecutive terms till 1976.it was during this period that a storm was brewing in the congress. the post-nehru and shastri-era saw the emergence of indira gandhi and her struggle against the old guard. the phase saw the young gujral being drawn into the vortex marking his presence in the corridors of power.such was his rise and proximity to the changing structure of power that gujral was bracketed as someone in the early version of indira gandhi's kitchen cabinet. interestingly, in his book gujral describes indira gandhi as a split and very complex personality, who could be mean, petty, and vicious yet large-hearted, gracious and charming. gujral, however, held grudging respect for indira gandhi in whose council of ministers he served as a minister of state for parliamentary affairs and communications, information and broadcasting, works, housing and urban development and later planning.while students of politics were fortunate that gujral left behind his memoirs for posterity, unfortunately he preferred not to elaborate as to why he fell out of favour with indira gandhi. reports later suggested that he was not particularly keen to implement censorship that came in the wake of internal emergency. it is perhaps the gentleman-politician him that made gujral avoid reference to the period or that of the rise of sanjay gandhi.for gujral, a self-confessed communist, his posting as india's ambassador to the then ussr between 1976-1990 served as springboard for his role later as the external affairs minister during the 1989-90 vp singh's government.his days in moscow allowed gujral to follow the india's foreign policy from close quarters especially since indira gandhi had excellent personal equations with the top soviet leaders and the back and forth communication between new delhi and moscow through him.after his return from moscow in 1980, amid growing distance from the congress under indira gandhi, his intellectual and political thought was stimulated in the company of the leaders with socialist leanings.the period saw national upheavals and gujral attending opposition conclaves in various parts of the country, studying trouble in jammu and kashmir, the mandal upsurge and the mandir-masjid issues that dominated political discourse in the country.during his tenure as the external affairs minister in the vp singh government, he expounded the gujral doctrine which he expanded later first in his second stint in the ministry of external affairs under h d deve gowda and later as prime minister between april 1997 and march 1998. among the books he published is one on a foreign policy for india.at a time when the united front was under pressure to change prime minister deve gowda, gujral emerged the front-runner. in fact, gowda cautioned gujral against assuming the mantle under such circumstances. the congress withdrew support to the janata dal government during march 1998 over the continuation of the dmk in the coalition government in the wake of jain commission of inquiry into rajiv gandhi assassination.during his tenure, a controversial decision to impose president's rule in uttar pradesh was returned by president kr narayanan. it is perhaps the umbilical ties with undivided punjab that drove the process to take india-pakistan relations on a different plane. in fact, a few months before he was chosen by the janata dal to lead the united front government at the centre, nawaz sharief had commented that india never had a prime minister from punjab while students of politics were fortunate that gujral left behind his memoirs for posterity, unfortunately he preferred not to elaborate as to why he fell out of favour with indira gandhi. reports later suggested that he was not particularly keen to implement censorship born on december 4,

christian college, lahore gujral became vice-president of the new delhi municipal committee in 1958 he formally joined congress and six years later, indira gandhi gave him a ticket with which he entered rajya sabha in april 1964 he was part of the 'coterie' that helped indira gandhi become prime minister in 1966 in indira gandhi's government, he held several portfolios as union minister for communications, parliamentary affairs and housing he was information and broadcasting minister when emergency was imposed (on june 25, 1975), which brought in arbitrary press censorship as he refused to kowtow to the powers-that-be, he was taken out of the ministry and sent by indira gandhi as ambassador to moscow he continued even during the tenures of her two successors - morarji desai and charan singh he left the congress to join the janata dal in the late-1980s gujral became external affairs minister in the vp singh-led national front government in 1989 he had a second stint as

2013-04-03,china ready to cooperate with india on afghanistan ashok tuteja/tns,"ashok tuteja/tnsnew delhi, april 2 concerned over the situation that might evolve in afghanistan after the withdrawal of the nato forces next year, china has finally acknowledged the significant role india could play in stabilising the situation in the war-torn country.top officials of india and china are expected to meet later this month to discuss how their two countries could cooperate in afghanistan so that the war-ravaged nation could stand on its own feet. the post-drawdown situation in afghanistan has been a cause of worry for both the countries.hitherto, china was wary of engaging with india on afghanistan, fearing that it might upset pakistan, its all weather friend. however, the rise of islamic fundamentalism in its own backyard in the muslim-dominated xianjing province and the spectre of the taliban raising its ugly head again in afghanistan appear to have compelled beijing to reconsider its afghan policy.according to official sources, the first signs of chinas attitude towards india on the afghan issue came when national security adviser (nsa) shivshanker menon visited moscow earlier this year for the india-russia-china trilateral meeting on afghanistans future. the chinese side was keen to know from menon how india viewed the emerging situation in afghanistan and how the country could be saved from going back to the days of the taliban regime. all the three countries are vehemently opposed to the western attempt at reconciliation with the taliban, contending that the militia could yet again push afghanistan back to the 1990s, thereby destabilising the entire region. china has made huge investments in afghanistan, especially in the mining sector, and has also signed a strategic partnership agreement with kabul on the lines of a similar pact signed by the embattled nation with new delhi in 2011.the sources said india was ready to cooperate with all countries in the region, including pakistan, to ensure the stability of afghanistan. however, islamabad has shown no interest in cooperating with india on the issue since it has been eyeing to run afghanistan through its proxies after the withdrawal of foreign troops.meanwhile, a lot of other engagements are also said to be in the pipeline between india and china now that the once-in-a-decade leadership transition process in beijing has been completed. officials of the two countries are also likely to meet this month for a meeting of the working mechanism on boundary dispute.following last weeks meeting between prime minister manmohan singh and new chinese president xi jinping in durban, there are indications that singh would visit beijing in the first part of the year. the chinese

2013-04-05,apex court slams use of beacon as status symbol r sedhuraman ," r sedhuraman new delhi, april 4 the supreme court today asked the centre and the states to minimise the use of red beacons and sirens in vehicles by restricting these to ambulances, fire tenders, police and a few other categories and impose heavy penalties on those who misuse the facility as a status symbol.a bench comprising justices gs singhvi and kurian joseph passed an order to this effect clarifying that this would effectively set aside orders passed to the contrary by various high courts.the other categories which could be allowed to use beacons were the constitutional heads of the political executive, legislatures and the judiciary. however, the siren/hooter should be banned except for ambulances, fire tenders, police and army personnel, the apex court clarified.the sc also suggested a substantial increase in the fine for unauthorised use of beacons and sirens, particularly by the wards of vips.further, the bench sought the response of delhi, punjab, haryana, rajasthan and uttar pradesh to a complaint by senior counsel harish salve, who is assisting the court as amicus curiae in the pil case, that politicians and other dignitaries from these states were bringing their gun-toting personal securitymen and police convoys to delhi during their visits to the capital, causing hardship to the residents here.salve said vips from punjab had brought along their personal securitymen during the recent elections to the delhi sikh gurdwara managing committee (dsgmc) which had contributed to the violent incidents witnessed at that time. the sc asked the states to file their responses within a week.during the two days of hearing, the bench said people had a feeling that they were being treated differently and minimising the use of the beacon and siren, which had become a sort of status symbol, would address their grievance to a great extent.the apex court is hearing pils questioning the need for providing personal security to vips, including those facing criminal charges, at government cost despite the fact that the actual number of police personnel in several states was barely 50 per cent of the sanctioned strength.in an affidavit filed in the sc, punjab said it was spending rs 15.69 crore on personal security to vips, including 29 high court judges. at this, the bench wanted to know as to whether the state government was providing security to judges in addition to such cover being offered by the chandigarh administration. it also took note of the fact that 65 persons with criminal backgrounds were enjoying this facility.the bench is also going into the legal and constitutional validity of police stopping traffic on the roads to facilitate the movement of vips and the logic behind the government beefing up the security arrangements only for such people whenever there was a heightened threat perception in any particular city or town. also

2013-04-18,mig-21 completes 50 years in india ajay banerjee/tns," ajay banerjee/tns new delhi, april 17 it was 50 years ago that mig-21, the first supersonic fighter jet in the indian air force fleet, flew over indian skies. the plane, which went on to serve as a frontline fighter in 1971 war with pakistan, had then put new delhi firmly in the soviet union-led bloc during the cold war era.it was only 45 years later, in 2008, that india and the us started warming up to each other. in the intervening period, the soviet union collapsed and india emerged as a fledgling global power.fifty years later, there have been subdued functions to mark the arrival of the first mig 21 and 50 years of the indo-russian defence partnership. besides the mig-21, these 50 years have seen subsequent variants like the mig-23, mig-25, mig-27 and mig-29 in india. on april 15, general director of jsc ""russian aircraft corporation"" mig, sergei korotkov, presented a memento to the indian ambassador at moscow, ajay malhotra. on april 20, a book on migs in india will be released by air chief marshal nak browne.the first lot of mig-21s had arrived in mumbai in january 1963 and was assembled to be handed over to the 28 squadron, known as the 'first supersonics' in iaf terminology. the squadron was based at chandigarh, then no more than a fledging small-town of bureaucrats and the ruling political class. it was in april 1963 that the mig-21s started flying in a routine more than the speed of sound sending a noisy sound of the 'boom' across the plains of punjab. wg cdr dilbagh singh (later chief of air staff) was commanding the squadron at that time. the 1962 agreement for the supply of mig-21 to india was signed around the time india and china were just weeks away from bloody war. the iaf shortlist had the french mirage iii, the us-produced f-104 starfighter and ussr-produced mig-21. the mirage iii lost out due to high cost while the us reluctance to allow licensed production meant india opted for mig-21.fifty years later, russia and india have a defence partnership going and are now co-developing the fifth generation fighter aircraft (fgfa). new delhi's dependence on moscow may not be the same as cold war era, however, defence minister ak antony always acknowledges russia as a 'key ally'.first licensed production of mig-21 started in india in 1964. it was in 1980 that mig-23 arrived and two years later mig-25 termed as 'foxbat' arrived. this was primarily a spying plane of era when satellite imagery was not well developed and was based out sarsawa, saharanpur.in 1985, the india-ussr relations were on the upswing. the newly developed mig-29, the twin-engined fighter, was purchased by india. the western world was reportedly awestruck when it was first shown in finland in 1986. the developments of those times have to be juxtaposed with the intense usa-ussr rivalry and the fact that pakistan was a key ally of the us.today, after the cold war has ended, the indian navy had ordered the mig 29-k, the sea-variant of the mig-29, and deliveries have commenced. the first lot of mig-21s arrived in mumbai in january 1963 and was assembled to be handed over to the 28

its support to the agitating people of seemandhra is seen as a clever move by the party to occupy the political space being provided by the united ap movement.its main contention is that if the upa government cannot ensure ""equal justice"" to all the three regions, then it should not go ahead with the division of the state. this is widely interpreted in political circles as support for the demand to keep the state united.the ysr congress party, which has no representation in the telangana region, was the first to ask all the 16 legislators, including the floor leader and jagans mother ys vijayamma, to quit their posts before the congress working committee announced its decision on formation of telangana state on july 30. since then, its leaders have been playing an active role in the agitation in seemandhra.with the states division becoming a fait accompli and his own party losing political relevance in telangana, the high profile undertrial appears keen to capitalise on the anti-bifurcation sentiment sweeping seemandhra by positioning himself as the sole champion of their interests.by undertaking an indefinite fast, jagan may well look for the first mover advantage in the new territory and hope to reap rich electoral harvest there post-bifurcation. already, a string of opinion surveys show that his party holds the sway in seemandhra. security up the security was

2013-10-06,differences crop up with russia over fighter jet deal ajay banerjee ," ajay banerjee new delhi october 5 difference of opinion has cropped up between long-term partners india and russia over the prestigious project to jointly develop and produce the next generation fighter planes.the two countries had agreed in 2010 to develop the fifth generation fighter aircraft (fgfa), which at $ 30 billion usd would be the biggest defence deal ever in the world. the preliminary design contract (pdc) phase costing $ 295 million was completed on june 19. however, new delhi and moscow will take at least an year more to take the next step -- that is signing of the final design research and development (r&d) contract worth $ 11 billion. the draft contracts for the proposed r&d were exchanged in mid-2012. indias share is $ 5.5 billion. since then, developments have lost pace. sources said india wants access to technical data and be a contributor in the r&d as that will enable its teams to get experience. also, india is seeking a ban on the sale of the plane to other countries. indian planners accept in private is that russia, or any other country, would never part with engine design specifications and metallurgy. india is looking to be more than a monetary contributor in the deal, said the source. the iaf chief, air chief marshal nak browne, confirmed yesterday that brakes had been put on the fgfa project, at least for now. we are still working on the r&d contract. it will take one more year. technical discussions are on. till we get technical details, which we need to know, we cannot even get to the issue of discussing financial terms and conditions, the iaf chief said. the first hint of delay was when russian president vladimir putin visited delhi in december last year but the r&d contract was not signed. the first induction was planned for 2022, but the assessment within the mod is that it will be delayed. four prototypes of the code-named pak-fa are already flying in russia.the plane has stealth features enabling it to be somewhat masked from enemy radars. it will have advanced features such as super-cruise, ultra-manoeuvrability, highly integrated avionics suite, enhanced situational awareness, internal carriage of weapons (that is under-carriage weapons will not be visible) and network centric warfare capabilities.only when the r&d contract is signed, the fgfa prototypes will be available in india. the first is slated in 2014. it will be flight-tested by indian pilots and monitored by indian engineers. two more prototypes will

independent centre of the university of oxford. its board of trustees has scholars and statesmen from all over the world with the prince of wales being its patron.the centre contributes to the multi-disciplinary study of islamic world at oxford. lectures had been delivered in the past by sonia gandhi, nelson mandela, the un secretary-general and various heads of state and government. salman khurshid as law minister spoke on unity, not uniformity: politics of modern india.chor bizarre in londonsince london is as much known to many punjabis as ludhiana, its popular tourist attractions such as madame tussauds, london eye and the tower of london do not need any description. despite the slowdown and high prices london remains a shoppers delight, offering a world-class experience.kensington palace has put up on display the exquisite wardrobes of the queen, the princess of wales, diana, and princess margaret if one wants to know how royal fashion has changed since the 1950s. for the first time in 100 years, the worlds largest cache of elizabethan and early stuart jewellery is being displayed at the museum of london. the village at westfield london, the regent street and the bond street are shoppers popular destinations.the independent has judged indian restaurant chor bizarre as one of the 50 most romantic places in the world and amongst the top 10 restaurants in london. chor bizzare or thieves market, which is celebrating its 15th year in london, offers authentic indian cuisine in a unique atmosphere.ice-cream for allon way to london, indias ambassador to cuba c. rajasekhar shared some interesting information with journalists. the chief highlight of the vice-presidents visit was his meeting with fidel castro, facilitated by rajasekhar. according to him, india can learn a lot from cuba in affordable healthcare, disaster management and biotechnology. cuba excels in particular in two fields: education and healthcare. its literacy rate is 99 per cent, unemployment 2.5 per cent and infant mortality low at 4.76 per 1,000 compared to indias 45 or so.how ice-cream came to cuba is interesting. once, fidel castro was offered ice-cream in moscow. he liked it so much that he immediately asked the hosts for its recipe and ordered the chefs back home to improve on it. now, the cuban ice-cream is very popular and cheap. from food for all, castro moved to ice-cream for all. spying: back to typewriterslondon is without a regular high commissioner from india. the acting high commissioner, dr virander paul, organised a reception in honour of vice-president hamdi ansari. since journalists were disappointed with snacks at a similar function in lima and had to go without food at the ambassadors reception in havana, most were wary of going to the reception in londons bentley hotel. security restrictions were tight: no cameras, cell phones or any recording equipment. a media report pointed out that so suspicious are the high commission staff of spying after the us revelations that they have returned to typewriters for sending important messages. since not sure whether the embassy is bugged, staff members come out in the open for important conversation. summing upafter the visit to frankfurt, lima, havana and london, the most romantic memories one carries back home are of cycling along the main river in frankfurt and the visit to pachacamac archaeological sites, where in 200-400 ad women were intoxicated and sacrificed to please the sun god. havanas vintage cars, sea beaches and laid-back people remind one of the old world charms. while london is known for its rule-based life, even in havana traffic is disciplined. in the middle of night when roads are empty, drivers follow the traffic rules and stop at the red light, an unusual sight for the indian visitors. nirmal sandhu ","travelling vice-president oxford , ansari joins statesmen","travelling vice-president london , vice-president hamid ansari one

with a nominated legislator seeking his vote in the legislative council elections, tdp leaders also sought the intervention of governor esl narasimhan as they accused rao of making “venomous” attempts to tarnish the image of their party.according to b tirumala rao, inspector of iii-town police station in visakhapatnam, a case was registered against rao following a complaint by local lawyer nvv prasad.the complaint also alleged that leaders of the ruling trs in telengana were snooping on their tdp counterparts. the case has been registered under sections 464, 647, 471, 166, 167 and 120/b of ipc.in delhi, the congress sought a judicial probe into cash-for-vote allegations against andhra pradesh chief minister chandrababu naidu and also demanded his resignation.a purported conversation between naidu and nominated mla elvys stephenson, aired by local tv channels, further fuelled the row over alleged attempts by tdp to bribe the mla in exchange for his vote in favour of the party’s nominee in the legislative council elections.parakala prabhakar, adviser (communications) to the andhra government, dubbed the tapes as “fabricated” and said the government was taking the matter seriously.the purported conversation suggests that naidu was giving “assurance of all sorts” to the nominated legislator if he voted for the tdp nominee.prabhakar alleged that telangana government was trying to malign the image of the ap chief minister by resorting to “cheap tactics”.“it is not the chief minister’s conversation. how come they are available outside. telangana government has to answer that. the telangana chief minister and home minister should give answers,” parakala had said.the anti-corruption bureau of telangana is in the process of questioning tdp mla revanth reddy and

elections.based on a complaint by stephenson, acb officials arrested revanth, sebastian harry and uday simha as they were allegedly handing over rs 50 lakh to the mla.appealing to governor narasimhan, who is in charge of both the states, tdp leaders said, “governor, who is supposed to safeguard people’s rights, properties and law and order in the common capital, should not keep quiet.“he should control this venomous conspiracy of kcr before animosities flare up,” senior tdp leader payyavula keshav told reporters.naidu attacks kcr, soniameanwhile, in a strongly-worded attack over his name

chandrasekhar rao) is unable to do anything and is conspiring against me,"" he said while addressing a public meeting.in an attack on congress president sonia gandhi, he accused the party of doing injustice to andhra pradesh while bifurcating the state.""when the state was bifurcated on june 2, we held the 'nava nirmana deeksha'. that day was the independence day of italy, sonia gandhi's native country. on that day, we were hit on our stomach. sonia gandhi is such a leader. we cannot forget june 2 in our life,"" he said.“whenever june 2 arrives, we have to question the injustice done to us.

years, naidu said that he has equal powers along with the telangana government.""khabardar (beware). you have to remember this,"" he said.noting that law and order in the city is in the hands of the

2015-10-08,"modi attacks lalu, says 'beef' remark an insult to yaduvanshis","munger/ begusarai, october 8prime minister narendra modi on thursday launched a blistering attack on rjd supremo lalu prasad, saying his beef eating remark is an “abuse” and “huge insult” to yaduvanshis (yadav clan) and asked people of bihar to reject the grand secular alliance warning it will bring “jungle raj 2”.modi, who has been silent on the lynching of a man in dadri over rumours of eating beef despite widespread outrage, scoffed at lalu’s explanation that he made the beef remarks under the influence of some “shaitan” (devil).“i wonder the devil got only his (lalu) body to enter. i want to know how the shaitan got the address (of lalu). the devil got no other body in entire bihar, india and the whole world except that of his. and he also welcomed the devil as if some relative has come.;addressing rallies in munger, begusarai and samastipur, modi castigated the rjd chief over his ‘hindus also eat beef’ remark.“what all is he saying. what all yadavs eat? whatever position lalu rose to, it was because of these yaduvanshis and he insulted them. what kind of abuses you are hurling at them.i”s it not an insult of yadavs and bihar? do not humiliate the yaduvanshis so much? laluji, these yaduvanshis helped you to come to power,” said modi.insisting that lalu cannot absolve himself of his beef remark, he said, “people of bihar have to find out why the devil came to lalu only. what were his bad habits due to which it happened? do we have place for such people in bihar?“so far we were fighting (political rivals) human beings. now a devil has entered a human body which is after us.” the rjd chief, who had made the controversial remark in the aftermath of the dadri lynching, made a quick about turn, saying his tongue seemed to have been possessed by the devil in a moment of weakness.the remarks had created consternation in the grand alliance, as the leaders felt that this could help bjp polarise votes in its favour.amid a realisation that an undivided muslim-yadav combination could lead to problems for it, the bjp-led nda is keen to counter the rjd chief’s influence in the community.referring to dwarka connection of lord krishna in gujarat, modi projected lalu as a leader who does not honour “true yaduvanshi tradition” and alleged that he not only insulted them but everybody in bihar.“i come from the land of gujarat. dwarka is the land of lord krishna where people worship cows. they brought white revolution. as far as the question of following the true yaduvanshi tradition is concerned, it is being done there. and here the leaders are meting out this kind of insult to yaduvanshis. what kind of abuses he is heaping on them?”calling the grand alliance of the jdu-rjd and congress a “mahaswarthgathbandhan (alliance of great opportunism), modi asked the electorate to reject them, noting that they ruled the state for 60 years and were responsible for its backwardness.“it is time that people vote for the vikas raj (development) of the bjp. this election is a fight between jungle raj and vikas raj,” he said.modi, who is under attack from the grand alliance for allegedly insulting people of bihar through his dna barb against nitish kumar, repeatedly sought to project lalu’s beef remarks as an affront not only to the entire yadav community, whose primary occupation has been rearing cows, but to the entire state.he also used the death anniversary of jayaprakash narayan today to attack nitish and lalu, saying those who once sang paeans of the socialist leader have now joined hands with congress which had sent jp to jail during emergency.alleging that congress is trying to make a “backdoor” entry into bihar politics by aligning with the jd(u) and rjd after having lost its own relevance, modi questioned both lalu and nitish over their commitment to ‘jp’ who fought against the congress his entire life.“the congress imposed emergency and put jp behind bars where he fell ill and as a result passed away early... . standing by the same congress, they are now abusing the bjp. the congress ruled the state for 35 years followed by 15 years of the rjd and 10 years of the jd-u,” he said.“nitish came to power promising to end jungle raj. he has now joined hands with lalu to bring jungle raj 2. what relationship is there between this bada bhai and chhota bhai?“the three parties that destroyed bihar have come together,” he said, adding, “the huge number of people seen in bjp rallies will sweep the three parties away”.under constant attack from the grand alliance over rss chief mohan bhagwat’s demand for a review of the reservation policy—a contention quickly rejected by bjp—modi attempted to project the bihar election as a fight beyond caste issue and reached out to the youth.“political pundits will be forced to change their thinking in bihar. for the first time it will be (fought) above caste considerations. it will be fought on the issue of youth and development. these will be the central issues now,” he said attacking the rivals for unemployment and poverty in the state.like in the last lok sabha polls when the bjp-led nda won 31 out of 40 lok sabha seats, people should give a clear mandate to it in the assembly polls.there is a view that if the caste factor dominates in the election, it could help the grand alliance. thus bjp is trying to reorient the focus in bihar assembly polls to the issue of development and aspirations of the youth, projecting modi as a mascot of change.referring to noted hindi poet ramdhari singh ‘dinkar’, modi said his words that ‘singhasan khali karo, janata aati hai’ (vacate power, the common man is coming) have been taken seriously by the youth of bihar who want a change.“should those, who have ruined the state for 60 years, be allowed to come back to power again? if employment has to be generated and development has to come to the state, the jungle raj should not get another chance in bihar,” said modi.“let us remember jayaprakash narayan, sri krishna singh (bihar’s first chief minister)and ramdhari singh dinkar and take a vow to bring vikas raj in bihar,” he said.modi said that lalu is repeating the same dialogues, which he used to make 15 years ago and did nothing new “except bringing his two sons” in the forefront.rejecting opposition criticism that his government was catering only to the rich, the prime minister insisted that his government’s schemes are meant to uplift the poor who need the government and not the rich.referring to alleged crimes during rjd regime, he said “kidnapping had become an industry. people refused to venture out after sunset even during festivals. nobody bought a new vehicle fearing it would be snatched by goons.”he suggested that after nitish and lalu joined hands, such incidents have risen. “figures of the bihar government show that between january and july 4,000 kidnappings have taken place. do you want jungle raj or development ... bihar has youth and water as its main assets.“but both have not been utilised for development. give us a chance; come out in large numbers to vote. ensure that no devil returns,” he said.referring to the rs 1.65 lakh crore package announced by the centre for bihar, modi alleged that the state government is creating hindrances in its implementation.“but people won’t allow this to happen as they want growth development,” he said. — pti","modi attacks lalu , says ' beef ' remark insult yaduvanshis","munger/ begusarai , october 8prime minister narendra modi thursday launched blistering attack rjd supremo lalu prasad , saying beef eating remark “abuse ” “huge insult ” yaduvanshis ( yadav clan ) asked people bihar reject grand secular alliance warning bring “jungle raj 2 ” .modi , silent lynching man dadri rumours eating beef despite widespread outrage , scoffed lalu ’ explanation made beef remarks influence “shaitan ” ( devil ) .“i wonder devil got ( lalu ) body enter. want know shaitan got address ( lalu ) . devil got body entire bihar , india whole world except his. also welcomed devil relative come. ; addressing rallies munger , begusarai samastipur , modi castigated rjd chief ‘hindus also eat beef ’ remark.“what saying. yadavs eat ?

chairman sudheendra kulkarni’s face for refusing to cancel former pakistan foreign minister khurshid mahmud kasuri’s book launch here.“when i got out of my home this morning, a group of shiv sainiks stopped my car. when i came out, they smeared me with black paint. they abused me,” kulkarni alleged and said that his orf, a foreign policy think tank, will go ahead with the planned book launch by kasuri later today despite the attack.“we won’t be cowed down by such events and the book launch will happen as planned,” he said and soon after was present at a media interaction along with kasuri while still drenched in paint.;mumbai police spokesperson dhananjay kulkarni said the incident occurred in front of kulkarni’s house near kings circle in suburban matunga at around 9.30 am. “about five-seven unknown persons shouted some slogans and threw colour or ink on him,” he said, adding the city police will provide security for the event to prevent any untoward incident.the attack drew sharp condemnation from parties, with the congress saying that “the idea of india as the most liberal democratic country, despite all our neighbours having gone the other way, is being destroyed in the root”.defending the action of party activists, senior shiv sena leader sanjay raut said, “smearing ink is a very mild form of democratic protest. they are so upset about ink. imagine when our soldiers are killed and their blood is spilled. it is not ink; it is the blood of our soldiers.nobody can foretell how public anger will explode.""“people in the country are angry over the violence and bloodshed by pakistan. we do not have anything personal against kasuri or anyone else,” raut said.kasuri’s book ‘neither a hawk nor a dove: an insider’s account of pakistan’s foreign policy’, which was recently unveiled in delhi, was set to be lauched in mumbai today.sena had demanded that the event be scrapped and had threatened to disrupt it.kulkarni, who has served as speechwriter for bjp veterans atal bihari vajpayee and l.k. advani, had met sena chief uddhav thackeray at the latter’s residence ‘matoshree’ here late last night, but left without getting any assurance from him.kasuri said he was “most upset” over the “unfortunate” incident and asserted that while he respected the right to protest, it should be done in a democratic manner.“i recognise people’s right to protest, but what has happened with sudheendra kulkarni is not protest,” he said.“nations are made with a positive mindset, we need a positive mindset,” he said addressing a joint press conference with kulkarni shortly after the latter faced an ink attack outside his home here this morning.the pakistani leader said the main purpose of his visit was to talk about the peace process between india

threat, maharashtra’s home department, headed by chief minister devendra fadnavis, had assured the organiser of full security. sudheendra kulkari thanked the chief minisiter saying he had taken a “princpled and firm stand”.on his meeting with sena chief, kulkarni said, “i pointed out to uddhavji that kasuri should be allowed to put forth his views. i also told him that if the sena has a different view point, they could protest in a democratic, peaceful manner.”“the sena president told me that unlike ghulam ali, kasuri was not an artist but was part of the machinery which perpetrated terror,” he told pti.“i told uddhavji that as they (sena) have a right to protest peacefully, we also have the right to hold the programme,” he said.“i informed him that kasuri was pakistan foreign minister during 2002-07 and was not a minister when the 2008 mumbai terror attack happened,” he said.it was brought to the sena leader’s attention that kasuri in his book has criticised non-state actors perpetrating terror, he said.the sena, which shares power with the bjp in maharashtra, has written to the director of worli’s nehru centre to cancel the event because of the pakistan connection.sena also hit out at parties who attacked it for the incident.“the stooges of pakistan are upset over the incident. why doesn’t their blood boil, when our soldiers’ blood is spilled and

2016-05-19,mamata remains the ‘queen of bengal’,"kolkata, may 19mamata banerjee, the stormy petrel of west bengal politics, once again proved a master strategist decimating the new left-congress combination and the bjp all of whom sought to checkmate her return to power.the 61-year-old feisty leader, who had single-handedly wrecked the red bastion in west bengal in 2011 ousting left front’s uninterrupted 34-year-old rule, was unfazed by the coming together of left parties and their once bitter rival congress ahead of the assembly poll.she also faced an all-out attack by the bjp which fielded top party stalwarts led by prime minister narendra modi, amit shah, a battery of union ministers and state leaders for campaigning but they finally found that there was no way to stop her trinamool congress from romping home to victory.;founder and chairperson of the trinamool congress, which she set up in 1998 after falling out with the congress party in west bengal, banerjee, fondly called ‘didi‘ (sister) by her supporters, has been the nemesis of the ruling cpi(m)-led left front and has earned the reputation of being a tough street fighter.banerjee earned laurels for various development initiatives in the state but also faced criticism over saradha chit fund and narada scams.after taking over as chief minister in 2011, she had steered the trinamool congress through victory in subsequent elections to panchayat, civic bodies and the 2014 lok sabha.among various development schemes undertaken by her as the chief minister were ‘kanyashree’ schemes for girls and ‘sabuj sathi’ under which cycles were dsitributed among the students, besides rs 2 kg rice for the 8 crore people in the state.however, multi-crore scams like saradha and narada had dented the image of her party as the opposition had made it a prime issue.born to a middle-class family and daughter of a freedom fighter and student of law and education, banerjee in her initial years in public life was mentored by veteran congress leader subrata mukherjee - now ironically a senior minister in her state cabinet.banerjee, baptized into politics as a student leader in chhatra parishad — congress’ student wing in the 1970s, shot into limelight by pulling off a stunning victory over cpi-m heavyweight and former lok sabha speaker somnath chatterjee in the 1984 lok sabha elections in from jadavpur constituency to become one of the youngest mps.she soon became a rallying point for the anti-left front forces which saw in her an uncompromising, incorruptible and credible fighter in comparison to various senior leaders of state congress of nineties.after parting ways, banerjee had often dubbed the congress as the ‘b’ team of the cpi-m.perfecting the art of the impossible, the maverick and emotional politician first hogged the limelight by blocking jayaprakash narayan‘s convoy by throwing herself on the ground, when he came to kolkata to organise the masses against indira gandhi before emergency.defeated in 1989, she was back in the lok sabha in 1991 from kolkata south and retained the seat in 1996, 1998, 1999, 2004 and 2009.banerjee’s first tryst with the corridors of power came in 1991, when she became the union minister of state for human resources development, youth affairs and sports and women and child development in the pv narasimha rao government.later on, after forming the tmc, banerjee aligned with the atal bihari vajpayee-led nda government and became railway minister in 1999 and union minister for coal and mines in 2004.banerjee resigned as railway minister and left the nda just ahead of the 2001 assembly poll in bengal after the tehelka scam and allied with the congress for the assembly elections but could not dethrone the marxist party.in the 2004 lok sabha election, banerjee was the only one from the tmc to win.in 2006 assembly poll in bengal, her party managed to win just 30 seats in the 294-member assembly.but being a fighter, banerjee refused to be cowed down and led the protest against farmland acquisitions in singur and nandigram, which finally catapulted her to the seat of power in the state.a firebrand orator, she had coined a catchy slogan “ma, mati o manush” (mother, land and people) before the 2014 lok sabha poll and played on the anti-incumbency factor after more than three decades of left rule and the creeping disillusionment among several sections, like muslims, to decimate the left in partnership with the congress.known for her humble lifestyle, the seven-time mp successfully sold a vision of development, cashing in on the deep resentment among the middle classes and unemployed youths, promising jobs and development.her nondescript residence—a tiled single-storey house in a dingy lane close to the kalighat temple—and equally simple attire comprising cotton saris, jhola bags and cheap hawai chappals, endeared her to the masses.it has not been an easy journey though for mamata who turned her call for ‘parivartan‘ (change) into a reality with congress, her ally then, throwing its full weight behind her.her energy, charisma and political astuteness made banerjee one of the few mass leaders in the country. — pti",mamata remains ‘queen bengal ’,"kolkata , may 19mamata banerjee , stormy petrel west bengal politics , proved master strategist decimating new left-congress combination bjp sought checkmate return power.the 61-year-old feisty leader , single-handedly wrecked red bastion west bengal 2011 ousting left front ’ uninterrupted 34-year-old rule , unfazed coming together left parties bitter rival congress ahead assembly poll.she also faced all-out attack bjp fielded top party stalwarts led prime minister narendra modi , amit shah , battery union ministers state leaders campaigning finally found way stop trinamool congress romping home victory. ; founder chairperson trinamool congress , set 1998 falling congress party west bengal , banerjee , fondly called ‘didi‘ ( sister ) supporters , nemesis ruling cpi( ) -led left front earned reputation tough street fighter.banerjee earned laurels various development initiatives state also faced criticism saradha chit fund narada scams.after taking chief minister 2011 , steered trinamool congress victory subsequent elections panchayat , civic bodies 2014 lok sabha.among various development schemes undertaken chief minister ‘kanyashree ’ schemes girls ‘sabuj sathi ’ cycles dsitributed among students , besides rs 2 kg rice 8 crore people state.however , multi-crore scams like saradha narada dented image party opposition made prime issue.born middle-class family daughter freedom fighter student law education , banerjee initial years public life mentored veteran congress leader subrata mukherjee -

2016-06-18,shiv sena turns 50 on sunday,"mumbai, june 18it was a cool rainy day on june 19, 1966, that a frail, young political cartoonist with fiery eyes assembled a loose ‘army of shivaji’ and launched the shiv sena for espousing the case and cause of ‘sons of the soil’.after many ups and down, mostly the latter, the saffron, ultra-right party is now celebrating the golden jubilee of its founding.a mega-bash is planned on sunday to mark the milestone, but doubts linger among its loyal soldiers, outside supporters, its allies and opponents and some others who barely tolerate it.;battle-weary with several causes it championed, depending on the political weather — pro-marathi chauvinism vis-a-vis anti-south indian, anti-north indian, anti-gujarati, its all-time favourites — anti-pakistan and anti-muslim and self-proclaimed guardian of hindutva versus ‘green terror’ and the like, the party finally tasted the fruits of power in 1995.en route, it was blamed for various ills like communal riots in different parts of the state and mumbai, blatantly taking sides in the communal divide in the city’s mafia with ‘hindu don’ versus ‘muslim don’ and different types of serious allegations against the party and members of the thackeray clan.before long, big brother in the form of then union home minister indrajit gupta came to mumbai in july 1996 wielding a small stick, which sent shivers down the spine of thackeray and his entire army. the party was, once and for all, sobered off its penchant for ‘thok-shahi’ (mobocracy) instead of ‘lok-shahi’ (democracy).it was voted to office first in 1995 in alliance with the bharatiya janata party and in 2014 piggybacking on the bjp, besides a nominal share in power at the centre under both nda regimes headed by then prime minister a. b. vajpayee and now prime minister narendra modi.perhaps out of sheer habit, whilst in government, it continues to run riot as ‘the embedded opposition’, occasionally even embarrassing the official opposition parties.at one point, the sena enjoyed such a dubious reputation that if thackeray merely raised his eyebrows, the entire city downed shutters to disappear in a self-imposed curfew mode.the ‘tiger’ thackeray’s personality, his dragon-fire speeches and bold writings through marmik, saamana and dopahar ka saamana managed to hold the party together and terrorised all opposition, within and outside.slowly, leakages started in the family and the party — members like nephew raj thackeray walked out and formed a new party, maharashtra navnirman sena, and diehard loyalists like chhagan bhujbal, narayan rane, sanjay nirupam and other less prominent ones quit the shiv sena to join different parties and flourished.among the current crop, many potentially strong leaders like manohar joshi are sidelined, or retired, some others have been softened with ministerial posts and many more are simply ignored.the sena continues to lack a strong party organisation, a support base mostly restricted to some urban centres like mumbai, thane, palghar, pune, aurangabad and nashik. it is still struggling in other parts of the state and obsessed with local level politics to capture civic bodies, especially the prosperous milch cow called mumbai.thus, like the good old days of bal thackeray, the jaded ‘army’ is now looking up to current chief uddhav thackeray, who in turn appears to a fatigued ‘general’, who keeps glancing at son aditya, as the party totters on behind them.apparent contradictions are galore: shiv sena harbours national ambitions, effectively put forth by bal thackeray, and has even fought elections independently in several states but is moored in regionalism.it passionately seeks to be the torch-bearer of hardcore ‘hindutva’ but is constrained by realpolitik and electoral compulsions, though nobody objected when the late thackeray was proclaimed as ‘hindu hriday samrat’.its gen-next is largedly confined to siblings or cousins, or children of existing leaders, with limited appeal among the youngsters.sorely lacking a dedicated think tank, the party gets its daily dose of ‘englightenment’ thanks to the tankful of wisdom emanating from its mouthpieces delivered by the newspaper vendor.amidst all this, in its 50th year the shiv sena is still fervently hoping to capture the brihanmumbai municipal corporation (bmc) and other important civic bodies independently in 2017, and struggling hard to achieve the late thackeray’s dream of ‘100 percent shiv sena’ in the 2019 assembly election.much noise and verbal fireworks are expected during its golden jubilee year, luckily coming when the party is in power. but a lot more effort would be needed to clear the clouds hovering on its future or risk a fade-out on the political horizon. — ians",shiv sena turns 50 sunday,"mumbai , june 18it cool rainy day june 19 , 1966 , frail , young political cartoonist fiery eyes assembled loose ‘army shivaji ’

2017-06-18,of gandhi and ao hume,"keki daruwallawe are a nation of idol-makers and also idol-breakers. there’s a caveat here, for when we talk of iconoclasm, one is not thinking of mahmud of ghazni. memory, envy and agenda comprise the trident or trishul that breaks idols for us. as memory starts ageing, the lustre around a man like mahatma gandhi starts wearing off.(followthe tribune onfacebook;andtwitter @thetribunechd)two years ago, i was returning from a university after delivering a lecture and was asked by a driver of the taxi they had hired for me, ‘sahab kya gandhi achche aadmi they? (was gandhi a good man?)’ so, how can we blame mr amit shah for calling gandhi a ‘bahut chatur bania’, as he did recently somewhere in chhattisgarh? he was thinking of gandhi being far-seeing and cited his known opinion that the congress should have been dissolved after independence. but mr shah possibly did not realise that when a man of his stature, president of the bjp, lets drop such an expression, it is likely to stick to our memory of gandhi, will become a part of history. what do i remember of european history, or of the holy roman empire? it was neither holy, nor roman, nor an empire. the 1688 great and glorious revolution of england? it was neither great, nor glorious, nor a revolution. so will gandhi be confined to that triple-worded mantra, ‘bahut chatur bania’?;the second tine of the trident i talked about was envy. that is bound to occur when smaller people find themselves on the same stage as nehru and gandhi. incidentally, when we denigrate nehru, as is the fashion today (it is almost compulsory), do we remember that nehru spent 10 years in jail, a place where jinnah did not spend a day? not a night did he spend there, the maker of pakistan, with the jailor passing him his thali of dal roti through a grill at sunset. i am never tired of pointing out nehru’s 10 years in jail, where he wrote most of his books. people like john kennedy and lyndon johnson were proud to meet nehru, such was his stature. and einstein downwards everyone was happy and proud to meet gandhi.gandhi incidentally was not happy meeting mussolini, the man favoured by the veterans of our boisterous roistering right-wingers. in his book “the good boatman”, rajmohan gandhi says, “when he (gandhi) met mussolini in rome in 1931, another facet of his non-violence was revealed. he disliked the italian dictator’s trophies of war and suspected his ‘catlike eyes’. he thought mussolini was a cruel man.” the author has culled these facts from ‘the diary of mahadev desai, may 1932’.thank god that the congress did not dissolve itself after independence, or we would have been at the mercy of the hindu mahasabha. how would my generation have felt if after gandhi’s emphasis on truth, ahimsa and communal harmony, the nation would have been led by godse’s ‘ideals’?then comes agenda. it is a fallacy of the present political establishment to equate nehru mukti with congress mukti. let nehru and gandhi rest where they are and attack, like all robust politicians do — and politics is a game for robust men, just look at mr shah — the congress, emergency downwards. when are we going to see a non-nehru family president of the congress? next century? after rahul, will the next congress president be a vadra?the current mantra is aggression. pakistanis behead our men? give them surgical strikes and show all of it on tv, otherwise where’s the point? nepal won’t play ball with the madhesis? we’ll fix you buddy. and in our own uttar pradesh, you are not happy with the beef ban? and you were unhappy that we did not give a single ticket to a muslim? we will give you adityanath yogi. don’t blame politicians. today’s indian being what he is, aggression is the mantra for votes. under such circumstances, can there ever be any negotiation between gandhism and the current stance of right-wingers? gandhian values are well and truly entombed, not just by right-wingers, but by the indian youth itself.but the entire freedom struggle cannot be ignored. so appropriate patel. if the thackerays (not to be confused with our calcutta-born william makepeace thackeray of vanity fair fame) can appropriate shivaji, why can’t bjp appropriate the sardar of bardoli?

2017-10-08,catering to mob is bad politics,"keki daruwallaaccording to a story i cannot vouch for, an african diplomat from a newly independent country asked a european counterpart what should be the focus of his address at the united nations. the answer was cryptic, “whatever you do, don’t speak in swahili.” that was obviously a metaphor. it meant don’t speak only of your own national problems — tribal animosities and aggressive neighbouring countries eyeing diamond mines — but also address the world. the planet too has problems, and always will.this message has not been delivered so far to our ruling party. atal bihari vajpayee started the tradition of speaking in hindi at the un. atalji may not have been exactly a demosthenes or edmund burke, though was always touted as such by his party and people across the board in the indo-gangetic plains. he was an orator. speaking extempore always, with studied pauses which got longer as he got on in age, he still held his audience well enough and ended with a flourish. and even when in opposition, asked to lead delegations to geneva and new york to un meetings regarding human rights and pakistan accusations on violence from india, he spoke for the nation splendidly. neither vajpayee nor narendra modi are too comfortable speaking in english.but our foreign minister has no such problem. why must then sushma swaraj speak at the un in our official language when only people in nepal and northern india can understand it? this is one occasion when the world wants to listen to you. listening to translations through headphones is not the same, and often by the time the translation reaches you, the speaker has gone ahead with a punch line which draws applause. the listener feels left out.;clearly she was speaking to the indian electorate. in english there would have been a little less of “they produced jaish, we produced iits, they produced terror camps, we produced iims.” there was of course applause, and i am sure that did not look stage-managed, though we have seen that the party has excellent event managers. in fact, event managing is the party’s strong suit. the much-touted speech sounded a bit brash and not in keeping with swaraj’s usual sensitive response to events and appeals from distressed persons, including pakistanis with problems. we could leave this sort of talk to our generals and the current army chief, general rawat, seems to be specialising in it. like his boss, he even backed his major in tying up a kashmiri to a jeep while facing a stone-throwing mob.the worrying thing is that the bjp, which means the government, is already in election mode. in kerala, the bjp yatra has taken off. remember amit shah’s rather delicate jibe that the only yatras the congress participates in are with the ashes of mahatma gandhi, nehru and indira gandhi? incidentally, the saffron-clad mahant-cum-cm that he is, adityanath yogi is also in the kerala march. he has announced that diwali celebrations would be held in ayodhya with buildings on the banks of river saryu illuminated, governor and high officials in attendance. the departments of irrigation, culture and public works have already been tasked — that is how government funds need to be spent. adityanath will then hasten to gorakhpur on october 18 for diwali puja. i think he spent five days in gorakhpur during durga puja. when exactly will he be back to work? he may be awaiting the winter.the electoral mode means there will be more prancing on the stage and cementing of various foundation stones for an iit here and an aiims there (it’s happening in himachal), populist schemes, promises and empty promises. in other words, a national effort to please the mob. catering to the mob is bad politics. this could be bad for long-term measures that need time to mature and show results, bad for strategic decisions as opposed to tactics for short-term gains and scoring points — in other words, for governance in general. governance, especially diplomacy, means a lot of balancing, between arab nations and israel and between former cold war opponents, the us and ussr. russia is almost in cold storage.nearer home, it involves a balance between the madhesis in nepal and the government in kathmandu, and a little less of bragging please about how we aided nepal after the earthquake. we need to balance the concerns of bangladesh on the influx of rohingya refugees and myanmar’s fake security concerns.at home, the government will have to balance its aggressive militarism with the treatment meted out to dalits and muslims. cow vigilantes have left quite a scar on these communities, and now comes a garba killing — people in gujarat killing a dalit because he watches a dance, and garba is a community dance. it may be noted that mob violence, which emerged with the cow vigilantes, spread to lynching of witches and now of dalits watching a dance!",catering mob bad politics,"keki daruwallaaccording story cannot vouch , african diplomat newly independent country asked european counterpart focus address united nations. answer cryptic , “whatever , ’ speak swahili. ” obviously metaphor. meant ’ speak national problems — tribal animosities aggressive neighbouring countries eyeing diamond mines — also address world. planet problems , always will.this message delivered far ruling party. atal bihari vajpayee started tradition speaking hindi un. atalji may exactly demosthenes edmund burke , though always touted party people across board indo-gangetic plains. orator. speaking extempore always , studied pauses got longer got age , still held audience well enough ended flourish. even opposition , asked lead delegations geneva new york un meetings regarding human rights pakistan accusations violence india , spoke nation splendidly. neither vajpayee narendra modi comfortable speaking english.but foreign minister problem. must sushma swaraj speak un official language people nepal northern india understand ?

2017-11-21,master politician who took bengal by storm,"articulate and multifaceted, priya ranjan dasmunsi was a master in political manoeuvring and the topmost leader of the youth brigade that took west bengal by storm in the late 1960s, to sideline the communists and bring back the congress to power in 1972.it was a time when the maoist movement went from strength to strength in the state, with bright youngsters leaving schools, colleges and universities to follow charu majumdar’s doctrine of annihilating ‘class enemies’, that virtually saw a bloodbath over the years.dasmunsi was then the magnet for those young men and women, who disagreed with the communist party of india-marxist (cpi-m) — the main force of the two united front governments in the state in 1967 and 1969 — as also the policy of the bullets espoused by the maoists.first as a student leader in the calcutta university, and then as a brilliant youth congress organiser, dasmunsi was a major draw with his fiery oratory and many of his proteges like subrata mukherjee and sougata roy went on to occupy key positions in the government, state congress, and in later years, to the breakaway trinamool congress.;a grieving mukherjee recalled the turbulent 60s and 70s. “i have become fatherless again. in my politics, as also at a personal level, i had only priya da. we were a pair. everybody used to say priya-subrata. he led a high-quality student movement under the banner of the chhatra parishad. it was because of him that the left-led united front lost power, and ss ray became chief minister.”dasmunsi’s talent saw his meteoric rise in the 1970s in the congress, then led by indira gandhi. he became an all-india congress committee member in 1970 and was made the state youth congress chief the same year. he entered the lok sabha from the then south calcutta seat in 1971, at the young age of 26.as early as 1971, he was elected president of the all india youth congress, a position he held till 1975, when sanjay gandhi removed him to anoint his (gandhi’s) favourite, ambika soni, to the post.dasmunsi did not take the snub kindly, and left the congress in 1979, when the party split after it lost power at the centre in 1977 at the height of the anti-emergency wave.dasmunsi joined the congress (socialist), became its west bengal president and is said to have commented in public meetings that he would rather change his religion or eat cow-dung than return to the parent party.but that he did after the congress rode back to power in 1980, though indira gandhi never forgave him for turning against her during her difficult days.in 1985, then prime minister rajiv gandhi inducted dasmunsi in his council of ministers as minister of state for commerce. dasmunsi also served as minister of information and broadcasting and parliamentary affairs in prime minister manmohan singh’s cabinet from 2004 to 2008, when he suffered a paralytic stroke, lost his power of speech and went into a coma from which he never came out.as i&b minister, dasmunsi banned several western television networks, calling their broadcasts obscene. during his tenure, the centre got indian sports broadcaster nimbus to share broadcast rights for indian cricket matches with the state-run doordarshan. besides brining out the dakhhini barta magazine, for which he wrote a large number of well-crafted articles and other literary works, dasmunsi stewarded the country’s football for close to two decades till 2008, when, after his illness, praful patel took over the reins.in 1994, dasmunsi married actress deepa dasmunsi, who later became an mla and mp. the couple has one son, priyadeep, nicknamed michil (rally). — ians",master politician took bengal storm,"articulate multifaceted , priya ranjan dasmunsi master political manoeuvring topmost leader youth brigade took west bengal storm late 1960s , sideline communists bring back congress power 1972.it time maoist movement went strength strength state , bright youngsters leaving schools , colleges universities follow charu majumdar ’ doctrine annihilating ‘class enemies ’ , virtually saw bloodbath years.dasmunsi magnet young men women , disagreed communist party india-marxist ( cpi-m ) — main force two united front governments state 1967 1969 — also policy bullets espoused maoists.first student leader calcutta university , brilliant youth congress organiser , dasmunsi major draw fiery oratory many proteges like subrata mukherjee sougata roy went occupy key positions government , state congress , later years , breakaway trinamool congress. ;

2018-05-26,kumaraswamy wins trust vote as bjp walks out of k'taka assembly,"bengaluru, may 25the three-day-old kumaraswamy government in karnataka on friday won a vote of confidence without a contest, with the bjp mlas walking out of the assembly before the floor test, in an unexciting end to the 10-day high-voltage political drama after the polls yielded a hung house.it turned out to be a smooth sailing for the 58-year-old h d kumaraswamy, as bjp members trooped out of the house after leader of the opposition b s yeddyurappa’s blistering attack on the “unholy” jd(s)-congress coalition.kumaraswamy’s motion seeking the confidence vote was declared passed by voice vote by speaker k r ramesh kumar in the absence of the bjp mlas. kumaraswamy described the bjp walkout as “escapism”.;the first signs of the bjp conceding defeat in the numbers game were visible when it pulled out its candidate suresh kumar from the race for the speaker’s post, saying it had decided to honour the parliamentary tradition that the presiding officer should be chosen unanimously.congress’s ramesh kumar was elected the speaker unopposed.the jd(s)-congress coalition had claimed the support of 117 mlas in the 224-member house with an effective strength of 221.while the congress has 78 mlas, kumaraswamy’s jd(s) has 36, and bsp 1. the alliance also claimed support of the lone kpjp mla and an independent.as kumaraswamy had won from two constituencies, the 104-member bjp needed seven more mlas to defeat the motion.but like on may 19, when yeddyurappa failed to muster support of as many lawmakers required to anchor his government’s ship safely, and stepped down, the bjp did not go for a showdown.seeking the trust vote, kumaraswamy asserted the congress-jd(s) coalition government would complete its five-year term, while maintaining he was conscious that his party jd(s) does not have a majority on its own.“i am pained that people have not placed their trust in me,” he said, as he moved the motion seeking the vote of confidence of the assembly in his government.he, however, said the coalition government will be “stable for five years”.“we will work for the people. we are not here to fulfil our personal interests,” he said, adding neither he nor the members of his family ever hankered after power, and spent most of their time in politics seated in opposition benches.the chief minister said there was a “blot” on jd(s) supremo and former prime minister h d deve gowda after he (kumaraswamy) joined hands with the bjp to form a coalition government in 2006.kumaraswamy said he was now relieved as that “blot” on his father’s reputation caused by his act of aligning with the bjp has been removed (with the formation of a secular government). deve gowda had strongly opposed kumaraswamy’s decision to form a coalition government with the bjp.he also said the government was committed to waiving farm loans, as promised during the elections.kumaraswamy accused the bjp-led government at the centre of using its agencies like the income tax department and the enforcement directorate against its political rivals.he alleged that “fake documents” had been created to claim he had floated a company in malaysia and had “huge” properties there.“an ed fellow asked me about it. i am ready to face any inquiry,” kumaraswamy said, asserting he would not be cowed down by such bullying tactics.before staging a walkout, yeddyurappa launched a stinging attack on kumaraswamy, saying the chief minister was known for his acts of “betrayal”.the bjp under yeddyurappa had propped up the jd(s)-led government in 2006 as part of a power sharing arrangement of rotational chief ministership. after kumaraswamy had completed his 20-month term and yeddyurappa’s turn came to become the chief minister, the jd(s) withdrew support in seven days.yeddyurappa told the congress members that kumaraswamy and deve gowda would “finish” their party.“the father (deve gowda) and sons will finish the congress,” yeddyurappa said, adding he had no problem “if you want to be onboard the sinking ship of kumaraswamy”.dubbing the jd(s)-congress alliance “unholy”, he said the two parties had defied the popular mandate which was in bjp’s favour.“the jd(s) lost security deposit in 121 constituencies and did not win even a single seat in 16 districts,” he said, adding the coalition dispensation was a “government on daily wages”.today’s confidence vote was the second in less than a week, and on both occasions the bjp baulked at the prospect losing the numbers game and chose to avoid voting.yeddyurappa, who was sworn in as the chief minister on may 17, had stepped down two days later in the face of impending defeat without going through the motions of a floor test.kumaraswamy had taken oath on wednesday in a grand ceremony where a galaxy of top leaders of anti-bjp national and regional parties were in attendance, in a rare show of unity ahead of the lok sabha polls next year.the jd(s) leader’s real challenge will now be the expansion of his ministry, with leaders in the alliance already jockeying for cabinet berths
