2013-05-04,what’s behind that glass of milk?,"illustration: deepak harichandan , you know that child who throws a terrible tantrum over a glass of milk. how he kicks and screams and refuses to touch the stuff? haven’t you wondered what the fuss is all about? after all, it’s just a glass of milk., it turns out the child may just have the right idea. the business of producing milk — indeed, the multi-crore rupee cattle industry it’s a part of — is sustained by a process of relentless cruelty towards animals, from birth till death, with little letup. cruelty compounded by poorly defined, poorly implemented methods and gross violations., in 1998, india, hitherto a milk-deficient nation, surpassed the u.s. as the highest milk-producing nation, a position it holds till date. according to the department of animal husbandry, dairying and fisheries, the government has invested rs. 2242 crore to help meet a national demand of 150 million tonnes of milk by 2016-17. millions of cattle will be produced (mainly through artificial insemination) for this purpose., this will be done through “productivity enhancement, strengthening and expanding village-level infrastructure for milk procurement and providing producers with greater access to markets. the strategy involves improving genetic potential of bovines, producing required number of quality bulls, and superior quality frozen semen and adopting adequate bio-security measures etc.” today india is home to the world’s largest cattle herd, with 324 million head., the government is positioning this as a food security measure for the future. from the point of view of the animals, though, unthinkable cruelty lies ahead., that image of tender care and worship that we are raised with, the image that is propagated in films and integrated with our cultural values — that’s a myth. in reality, the life of a cow in india is a horror show., the first three stages of life — birth, maturity and motherhood — happen with inhuman haste. the female calf is born. she reaches puberty somewhere between 15 months and three years of age, depending on the breed, and is then impregnated, increasingly through artificial insemination., arpan sharma, external relations in-charge at the federation of indian animal protection organisations, builds partnerships for better protection of animals by bringing together various stakeholders such as industry, government and regulators. he says, “due to poor equipment and a lack of proper training, artificially inseminated cows sometimes become infertile and develop infections with few to care for them.”, soon, the calf is born. while the cow is seen as a metaphor for motherhood, she is rarely given a chance to experience its joys for very long. calves are separated from their mothers soon after they are born so that they don’t drink up all the milk. just what does this do to these docile creatures?, the american physician dr. michael klaper, the author of books such as vegan nutrition: pure and simple and pregnancy, children, and the vegan diet, provides an insight. “on the second day after birth, my uncle took the calf from the mother and placed him in the veal pen in the barn — only 10 yards away, in plain view of the mother. the mother cow could see her infant, smell him, hear him, but could not touch him, comfort him, or nurse him. the heartrending bellows that she poured forth — minute after minute, hour after hour, for five long days — were excruciating to listen to. they are the most poignant and painful auditory memories i carry in my brain,” he said in a 2010 interview with the northwest veg, a non-profit organisation based in portland, oregon., eileen weintraub of help animals india and vishakha society for protection and care of animals, vishakhapatnam, takes this fact to its logical extreme. she states firmly, “with 1.2 billion people and 400 million vegetarians, anyone who does not have a vegan diet contributes to the suffering of cows.”, ***, i once asked my mother, “if we take milk from cows, then what does the calf drink?” she said the milk a cow produces is more than the calf requires, and humans use what’s left over., apparently not. “the quantity of milk a calf gets varies. by and large, unless the calf is what is called “replacement stock,” it will get only the bare minimum necessary for survival. often it will not even get that,” says sharma. , to increase yield, the cows are also injected with oxytocin, a hormone banned in india under the prevention of cruelty to animals act and section 12 of food and drug adulteration prevention act, 1960. “studies around the world show that cows injected with oxytocin have a greater incidence of abortions, mastitis and lower conception rates, and their calves suffer higher than normal infant mortality and delayed puberty,” says erika abrams, founder of animal aid unlimited, an animal rescue organisation based in udaipur., and what happens to unwanted male calves? this is where we wade into the red zone of this bloody business. “milk cows need to produce a calf every year and half those calves are male. while a fraction of these are used to pull ploughs, others are butchered. their skin is used for leather, and their meat for local consumption and export,” says abrams. calf leather comes from male calves of which india has a huge number., the ones that live don’t fare much better. with traditional backyard agriculture slowly giving way to ‘intensive dairy farming’, hundreds of cows are confined for long periods within cramped, dark and acrid quarters. “more times than not even where there is a lot of space they are tied with a two-foot rope and in most cases all they can do is sit down and stand up even if they are in the open,” says nandita shah, director at sharan, sanctuary for health and reconnection to animals and nature, pondicherry. “at some places in mumbai, calves are tied outside till they die of starvation; so technically they have not been killed.”, divya narain, an animal rescue volunteer from bhopal, says, “at the state-run animal shelter in bhopal, we often get recumbent little male calves, which have been dumped on the streets to die.” in other words, male calves, more or less, suffer an early death., and what about cows? cows and buffaloes can be productive until about the age of 14 years. but in the existing set up, in which cows are kept pregnant for almost 300 days a year, most of them dry up by the age of five or six. and after spending most of her life being milked, enduring hormone injections and the trauma of separation, the cow is sent off to the slaughterhouse., twenty-eight indian states have cow-slaughter protection legislations in place. unproductive cows, therefore, are routinely trafficked to slaughterhouses in the states where laws are less stringent or non-existent — arunachal pradesh, meghalaya, mizoram, nagaland, tripura, lakshadweep, and especially kerala. a large number of cattle is trafficked to kerala, under inhuman conditions, from the neighbouring states as it is a major consumer of beef and does not have any regulation pertaining to cow slaughter. apuroopa podhardha, the legal adviser of people for cattle in india (pfci), a chennai-based animal rescue group, says, “thirty animals are crammed into a truck meant for six. in some instances, the legs of calves are tied and they are dumped in one on top of the other. furthermore, no provision for food or water is made”. cattle are also trafficked to west bengal, from where they are taken to bangladesh., pfci has conducted three cow-rescue operations in chennai. podhardha’s colleague arun prasanna g. says, “the latest delicacy in demand in the middle eastern markets is veal (the meat of a calf no older than three months). flesh of unborn calves is known to bear medicinal value hence pregnant cattle are slaughtered.” , prasanna says, “in many slaughterhouses, the act of slaughtering involves smashing the head of a cow with a sledgehammer, which renders it unconscious; then skinning it; and or hanging it upside down so that all the blood can be drained from the slit jugular vein, then skinning it live.” in a recent raid in an illegal slaughterhouse in chennai recently, there were 20 cattle. “we could only rescue six of them. the police insisted we file a complaint first, which gave the cattle owners time to hide the remaining cows.” the slaughterhouse owners received an anticipatory bail., ***, according to the ministry of food processing industries, india has 3,600 slaughterhouses, nine modern abattoirs and 171 meat-processing units licensed under the meat products order. these do not include the numerous and ever-growing number of illegal and unregulated slaughterhouses, estimated to be more than 30,000. according to the u.s department of agriculture’s report on livestock and poultry: world markets and trade, india became the biggest beef exporter in the world in 2012(till october) with 16,80,000 tonnes of beef and veal exports, followed by brazil with 13,94,000 metric tonnes and australia with 13,80,000 metric tonnes of exports. in 2013, india’s beef exports are forecast 29 per cent higher to a record 2.16 million tonnes, accounting for nearly a quarter of world trade., “the government gives subsidies to slaughterhouses because beef exports are a gold mine,” says prasanna. a us beef export federation study states india exported $1.24 billion worth of meat in the first half of 2012. according to tamil nadu veterinary and animals sciences authorities 1.4 million tonnes of cattle were legally slaughtered in 2012 nationwide., “one dead animal is worth approximately rs. 30,000. tissues from a cattle’s heart are used to rebuild livers. horns and hoofs are used to make buttons, skin is used for leather, flesh for meat, tail is used for fertility treatment, bones are used for whitening sugar, and producing gelatin,” says prasanna., in states such as madhya pradesh, where cow slaughter is illegal, trafficking is rife, and the dry cattle that are not transported are let loose on the streets, where they live the last days of their lives foraging in dustbins, eating plastic-infested garbage and drinking polluted water from open drains. , the government runs several goshalas, shelters for old cattle, across the country, but these are too few and are not governed by serious norms. suma r. nayak, an advocate and a trustee of the animal care trust, mangalore, says, “goshalas have started to operate along the lines of dairy farms; only accepting healthy, productive cows.”, for all this, milk may not even be as rich in calcium as we have been led to believe. amy lanou, ph.d., nutrition director for the physicians committee for responsible medicine in washington, d.c., says, “the countries with the highest rates of osteoporosis are the ones where people drink the most milk and have the most calcium in their diets. the connection between calcium consumption and bone health is actually very weak, and the connection between dairy consumption and bone health is almost non-existent.”, also, the growing numbers of cattle casts a heavy shadow on the environment. bovines produce methane when they pass gas. it is estimated that a bovine produces, depending on the breed, anywhere between 100 litres to 500 litres of methane a day. this is equivalent to the per-day carbon dioxide emissions of a car. india’s huge bovine population makes methane a dangerous

2013-09-16,"in muzaffarnagar, back to the future","boiling over: instead of trying to restore peace, the multitude of political parties are busy finger-pointing. army personnel at kutba village during curfew in muzaffarnagar. photo: sushil kumar verma | photo credit: sushil kumar verma , for someone — and i say it with some shame and embarrassment — who cut his teeth in journalism on a hefty diet of communal riots in western uttar pradesh in the 1970s-1980s, reading about the events in muzaffarnagar and seeing images of violence and destruction is like watching history replayed in slow motion. there are the same conflicting versions of who “started it first”; the same self-righteous assertion of innocence by both sides; the same familiar-sounding allegations of high-handedness/one-sidedness levelled against the police; and, most nauseatingly, the same political blame game., back then it was simpler to pick a villain. there were only two main political parties — the congress and the jana sangh (later renamed the bharatiya janata party). or two and a half if you counted the rashtriya swayamsevak sangh whose shadow always hovered in the background. now, there are enough parties to fill a planet. so, in the past few days we have seen the congress, the bjp, the samajwadi party, the bahujan samaj party and the rashtriya lok dal — to name a few — busy finger-pointing when they should have been trying to restore peace and sanity., generally, hindu-muslim relations are a great deal more robust today than they were in the 1970s when tension was always simmering under the surface — and a riot waiting to happen. while researching a book on the subject, i found a refreshing change in the attitudes of both communities. young hindus and muslims say they have no wish to carry on with old grudges and simply want to get on with their lives. but what has not changed and may, in fact, have become worse as electoral politics has become more fiercely competitive, is the cynical use of religion and caste for votes. the pattern of events in muzaffarnagar has an all-too-familiar ring: an incident, whose provenance itself is uncertain, blows up into a full-scale communal conflagration with a little help from an assortment of political interests united by an obscene greed for votes., divisive politics is not unique to india. political parties even in the most advanced countries thrive on divisions, mostly along race lines, but the mark of a civilised political discourse is to know when and where to draw the line. in the more civilised societies, the line is drawn at the point where there is a danger of tipping into violence — and a loss of human lives. in britain, for instance, even the most rabidly racist group would not be caught crossing the line between legitimate propaganda and incitement to violence. they would not be allowed to — plain and simple. moreover, there is evidence that british voters don’t reward hate politics., in india’s crude sab chalta hai laissez faire political culture, there are no redlines and political parties get away literally with murder. worse, voters often reward them for bad behaviour if they believe such behaviour has been exercised on their behalf. there is a certain chief minister who after state riots, went on to win three successive elections despite questions about his role in one of india’s worst examples of sectarian violence. and he could be your next prime minister!, in such a climate, it is a miracle and ultimately a tribute to the good sense of the overwhelming majority of indians that they are not easily provoked. but how long can they resist? the drip-drip of inflammatory rhetoric and provocative acts finally finds a spark somewhere. the muzaffarnagar flare-up was the culmination of as many as 27 communal incidents in the past one year. each incident would have contributed to ratcheting up the tension which slowly built up to a point where it needed just one slight push for it to explode., along with aligarh, meerut and moradabad, muzaffarnagar is part of a region where, historically, hindu-muslim relations have been fragile. north indian journalists of a certain generation spent disproportionately long periods of their early careers making sense of the frequency with which communal riots broke out in this part of western u.p. it became almost a routine to be woken up by an early morning call from the office and told to pack and leave for one of these towns because another riot had erupted., once there, we would be greeted by grieving victims from both sides, each blaming the other as is happening in muzaffarnagar now. again — as now — it was never clear how a riot started. it could have been sparked by a minor quarrel between members of two communities (those days we were not supposed to mention their religious affiliation and refer to them only as members of the minority or majority community); a road accident involving members of “rival” communities; a love affair between a muslim boy and a hindu girl or vice versa; unconfirmed reports of a cow slaughter; or a pig’s head allegedly found in a mosque…nobody knew for sure. everyone had heard it from somebody else., rumours flew thick and fast amid allegations of administrative failures and police excesses that each side claimed was directed against them — exactly what is happening in muzaffarnagar now., my experience of such situations is that the local urdu and hindi newspapers, usually owned by interested parties invariably tend to take partisan positions and fuel passions. this casts a special responsibility on the national media which, to be fair, has acquitted itself well in the past. indeed, rather bizarrely, at least one prominent delhi newspaper used to go to the extent of sending a muslim and a hindu reporter together to cover the same incident in the interest of “balance.” public comments, likely to inflame the situation, were heavily moderated., but this is the era of 24/7 television news — “live” images and instant sound bites. some indian tv channels have shown burnt houses, identifying them as belonging to a particular community. of course, truth must be told but in a way that is not seized by mischief-makers to create more trouble.",0.032646595828414005,"muzaffarnagar , back future","boiling : instead trying restore peace , multitude political parties busy finger-pointing. army personnel kutba village curfew muzaffarnagar. photo : sushil kumar verma &#124;

2014-03-27,bihar’s endless feudal violence,"angry supporters of the ranvir sena burn shops and vehicles during the cremation procession of their party chief brahmeshwar singh in 2012. , in the early hours of bhagat singh’s martyrdom day on march 23 this year, villagers of repura in the ara lok sabha constituency in bihar found the body of budhram paswan, secretary of the communist party of india (marxist-leninist)’s charpokhri block committee. he had been killed the previous night, as he was returning to the village for a meeting in preparation for the filing of lok sabha nominations by cpi (ml) candidates. the fir has named several well-known feudal elements of the neighbouring village, including three men accused in the ranvir sena’s 1998 nagari bazaar massacre., mr. paswan was one of the key activists who helped ensure that witnesses in the case withstood feudal terror and intimidation, and testified in court. this resulted in the conviction of the accused in the sessions court in 2010. the conviction was overturned by the bihar high court in 2013 — part of a series of such verdicts discrediting testimonies of survivors and eyewitnesses, and overturning lower court convictions in ranvir sena massacre cases. mr. paswan also helped the survivors find courage and determination to appeal against the acquittal in the supreme court. on march 23, ranvir sena supporters celebrated mr. paswan’s assassination, gleefully firing shots in the air. such celebrations underline the fact that the murder is a political one, intended to terrorise cpi (ml) supporters with a show of feudal muscle on the eve of an election in which the cpi (ml) is a strong contender from the ara seat., spate of terrorideologues of the bihar chief minister like to claim that feudal violence is a thing of the past thanks to sushasan (good governance) in the past nine years. is this true? in the 80s, feudal forces who unleashed terror to stop dalits from casting their votes had to contend with successful struggles by the oppressed and landless poor under the banner of cpi (ml) to avail of their right to vote. the same forces faced with cpi (ml) victories in lok sabha and vidhan sabha seats in bhojpur in the late 80s and early 90s formed the ranvir sena and conducted a spate of massacres with the purpose of terrorising the poor and checking their social and political assertion. now their strategy is to eliminate leaders and cadres like the cpi (ml)’s rohtas secretary bhaiyyaram yadav (killed in 2012) and mr. paswan. on independence day last year, the dalits of baddi were subjected to organised feudal violence that claimed a life, injured several people and destroyed a temple of the poet-saint ravidas, revered by the dalits., the continuous thread of feudal violence in bihar resonates with the hollowness of mr. kumar’s claims of ‘good governance’ and ‘development with justice,’ as well as his claims of principled aversion to narendra modi’s politics. his government began its first tenure by hastily dismantling the justice amir das commission that had been set up after the lakshmanpur bathe massacre to probe the political linkages of the banned ranvir sena. the commission was at the point of submitting its conclusions, and was likely to name several prominent national and state-level politicians, mostly from the bharatiya janata party and the janata dal (united), but also some from the rashtriya janata dal and the congress. therefore there was, among bihar’s ruling parties, a tacit consensus on the burial of the commission. the massacres took place with the open collusion of the rjd government, with lalu prasad declaring his willingness to ‘ally with the forces of hell’ to contend with the cpi (ml), and the mass acquittals took place under the aegis of mr. kumar., the bjp link, mr. modi, in his recent visits to bihar, has carefully chosen to project himself as a champion of the backward castes. for bihar which has witnessed the ranvir sena in action, this posture is especially mendacious. at bathani tola, the ranvir sena butchered women and children from the oppressed castes as well as backward muslims. the ranvir sena distributed election leaflets in the 90s seeking votes for the bjp. brahmeshwar singh, chief of the ranvir sena, in interviews given close to his death, openly admitted to having been a rashtriya swayamsevak sangh cadre since childhood, and wanting to see mr. modi as prime minister. much of the literature of the ranvir sena was copy-pasted from rss tracts, including demands for abolition of article 370, ban on cow slaughter and shrill anti-communism., if anyone needed further proof of the intimate ties of the bjp and the ranvir sena or any illusions of justice from mr. kumar, they should study the aftermath of the killing of brahmeshwar singh in 2012. bjp leader giriraj singh described brahmeshwar singh as bihar’s gandhi; mr. kumar took a leaf from mr. modi’s model of ‘rajdharm’; the police stood mute and allowed ranvir sena supporters to run amok in ara and patna, unleashing violence on dalits and on public property. brahmeshwar singh’s funeral and shraddh ceremony found several members of mr. kumar’s cabinet in attendance, not to mention an array of bjp leaders along with those from the jdu, the rjd and the congress., the thread of organised massacres and the quest for justice, of course, extends beyond bihar. in many ways, the nature of these bihar massacres presaged what would unfold in gujarat in 2002. bihar, gujarat, and muzaffarnagar, and of course delhi in 1984, have all been witness to organised pogroms conducted with political motives with the tacit or open collusion of the government and state machinery., development modelson the issue of ‘development,’ the choice between the ‘nitish model’ and ‘modi model’ is a dismal and misleading one. mr. kumar’s claims of miraculous development (echoed till his party’s recent divorce with the bjp) owes much to a carefully-crafted media campaign. the reality check is provided by the unstoppable flow of bihari youth out of the state, seeking education and employment that is denied to them at home. and it is ironic that mr. modi, bragging to the people of bihar about the development model of the ‘western states,’ forgets that the shiv sena and the maharashtra navnirman sena — both vying to offer him allegiance in maharashtra — are responsible for thrashing migrant labourers from bihar and other eastern states, whose labour contributes in no small way to the corporate-led ‘development’ of those states., mr. modi’s campaign has essentially been dominated by ‘theme gujarat’ and ‘team gujarat,’ for which the gujarat government’s resources are being used. with raj thackeray’s support in addition to the shiv sena’s, maharashtra’s might has been added to gujarat’s fuel power. gujarat and maharashtra are both arenas of corporate assertion and the corporate model of ‘development,’ and mr. modi’s campaign has taken on the overtones of the corporate home base against more backward regions., if the rjd regime allowed the feudal-communal ranvir sena a free run in bihar, mr. kumar’s regime allowed the rss and the bjp to strike deep communal roots in bihar.",0.05690120824449184,bihar ’ endless feudal violence,"angry supporters ranvir sena burn shops vehicles cremation procession party chief

2014-04-04,a hindutva variant of neo-liberalism,"“jo hindu hit ki baat karega, wohi desh par raj karega — only he who promotes the hindu interests will rule the country” declared a huge poster of mr. narendra modi outside the bharatiya janata party’s headquarters in new delhi in december 2007 when he won his second victory in gujarat. that election — and not december 2012, when he won the third election — could be seen as the launch of mr. modi’s version of hindu politics, which has been a distinct improvisation of its original version., what is being tested nationally in 2014 — contrary to what political analysts are terming as the debate on development triumphing over hindutva — is what one could call hindutva 2.0. many commentators have acknowledged the existence of a modi variant of politics, but few have understood it. going by mr. modi’s public pronouncements over several years, hindutva 2.0, is a particular variant of neoliberalism that dovetails religious nationalism with economic progress., traditionally, the hindu right in india has had to deal with three dilemmas that have stunted its growth. first, the conflict between the hindu traditionalists and the middle class; second, the hierarchical caste structure that endowed leadership to the minority upper castes, something that the majority lower castes began to resent increasingly as democracy took root; and third, the organisational question of how the rashtriya swayamsevak sangh (rss) should relate to its political wing (initially the jan sangh, and later, the bjp)., consequently, the bjp’s growth has been geographically patchy and electorally episodic. drawing upon this history of hindu nationalism in india, many people predict — and some hope — that mr. modi may not be able to outdo his predecessors, mr. a.b. vajpayee and mr. l.k. advani in the run for prime ministership. “we defeated vajpayee at his peak. mr. modi is no match to mr vajpayee,” says mr. jairam ramesh, congress strategist., history is, of course, a valuable pointer to the future, but it also teaches us that there can always be a first time. what has been unfolding in the gujarat social laboratory over the last decade as hindutva 2.0, has in no small measure overcome the three dilemmas mentioned earlier., mr. modi’s capability to mix the modern and the traditional is striking. when the small car tata nano project shifted from west bengal to gujarat, he likened it to lord krishna, born in mathura in uttar pradesh, reaching dwarka in gujarat to grow up. in the early days of the jan sangh, it could not emerge as the voice either of the hindu traditionalists or of the free market. the swantantra party had become the more legitimate voice of the free market., a decade ago, mr. vajpayee’s free market policies were staunchly opposed by sangh affiliates such as the swadeshi jagran manch. mr. modi managed to banish them all from gujarat, making it a middle class utopia. the anti-capitalist strand in the hindu right that repelled the modernising, pro-market middle class is now invisible and inaudible., on the other hand, appeals for traditionalism continue. “this is the land of people who worship cows. how can you support those who support cow slaughter?” mr. modi asked his audience in bihar on april 2, invoking a favourite issue of hindu politics for more than a century. a special campaign that the rss launched in 2010, for cow protection, has remained active since then, and the alleged stealing of cows by muslims is often cited as a reason for communal riots in uttar pradesh and bihar., mr. modi’s backward caste origins, a running theme in his campaign, helped by the social context, have helped him overcome lower caste suspicion of hindutva politics. the willingness among the upper castes to concede leadership to the lower has also helped, with mr. modi managing to send out a message that the political aspirations of the lower castes have enough room within hindutva politics. this aspect has been analysed in an article in the hindu (“in 2014, hindutva versus caste,” march 26, 2014)., this has been a contentious issue for decades, and at the core of the debate is the question of whether the political wing should give primacy to discipline and control, or openness and adaptability. after the bjp’s debacle in 2009, the issue came to the fore yet again with people like mr. arun jaitley arguing for a modern, liberal approach for the party, delinked from the rss. mr. modi himself had been challenging the rss’ authority in several ways until 2012. however, the bjp failed to find its feet and fell further into the abyss, making it the perfect setting for a return of the sangh into its affairs. but the rss-bjp question has been resolved in a peculiar fashion that deludes the veterans in the sangh into believing that they are in control; but what they are doing is merely bidding for mr. modi., but things are as they used to be between the bjp and the sangh, says mr. ram madhav, a senior sangh functionary. “there are two areas of cooperation. first, the common ideology that we believe in; second, the sharing of human resources. on both these counts, the sangh and the bjp continue to maintain their traditional linkages,” he says. as for the projection of mr. modi as the sole leader of the current campaign, mr. madhav says it is not unprecedented. “the rss is not against the projection of an individual leader. in fact, it is necessary. people are forgetting that in 2009, the slogan was ‘advani for prime minister.’ he was also the face of the ram janmabhoomi movement. therefore, the projection of mr. modi is not unprecedented or uncharacteristic,” he says., the rss’ writ runs in the bjp nowadays to ensure that mr. modi’s writ runs, and not to enforce any ideological regimen. the rss no longer holds the right to veto, but has an obligation to play along with the agenda set by mr. modi., there is a viewpoint that equates the economic policies of the congress and the bjp, but it overlooks several distinguishing characteristics. in fact, the most distinguishing feature of hindutva 2.0 is the model of economic progress that it promotes, in which hindu assertion is featured as a prerequisite for economic growth and prosperity.",0.09709617691545402,hindutva variant neo-liberalism,"“jo hindu hit ki baat karega , wohi desh par raj karega — promotes hindu interests rule country ” declared huge poster mr. narendra modi outside bharatiya janata party ’ headquarters new delhi december 2007 second victory gujarat. election — december 2012 , third election — could seen launch mr. modi ’ version hindu politics , distinct improvisation original version. , tested nationally 2014 — contrary political analysts terming debate development triumphing hindutva — one could call hindutva 2.0. many commentators acknowledged existence modi variant politics , understood it. going mr. modi ’ public pronouncements several years , hindutva 2.0 , particular variant neoliberalism dovetails religious nationalism economic progress. , traditionally , hindu right india deal three dilemmas stunted growth. first , conflict hindu traditionalists middle class ;

2014-04-07,we need to talk about this manifesto,"no official statement has come from the bharatiya janata party to explain its strange decision to release, in the face of the election commission of india’s displeasure, its manifesto on april 7, 2014 — the first of the nine ‘poll days’ constituting the 16th general election., election manifestoes are no big deal. that’s the message seemingly conveyed by the party that, according to most opinion polls, will form the next coalition government in new delhi, assuming of course that it can solve its ‘last mile’ problem by finding enough allies to connect to the magic number of 272 lok sabha seats., the big deal is the ‘vikas purush’ avatar of a former outlier, chief minister narendra modi, whose campaign machine has done everything in its power to obfuscate or draw attention away from the past, 2002 and all that. who needs a manifesto when there is modimantra, which actually heads the list of ‘core issues’ at the bjp’s official website, www.bjp.org? who needs a manifesto when there is the ‘gujarat model’ of governance, development, and social engineering that the rest of india needs to aspire to? (this message seems to fly notwithstanding the availability of a growing literature that reveals that when you look at various development and social indicators, gujarat is no model state.), message and realitywhat is clear by now is that the message is quite different from the reality: the bjp’s failure to unveil its manifesto weeks after most other parties, national and regional, have come out with their mostly elaborate exercises is no small deal. so what’s the real reason for this negation of the very idea of an election manifesto, which is meant to appeal to the heart and mind of voters?, fortunately, pro-bjp voices in the news media are more forthcoming than the party’s present high command. one of them, r. jagannathan, editor-in-chief of network 18 group publications, tackles the question in a provocative opinion piece titled “modi is the manifesto: why bjp doesn’t need a hefty document.” at the end of the article, mr. jagannathan comes to the real point: “manifestoes can be constricting”; they can act as “a tripwire for a party that hopes to win and form a government.”, in other words, an election manifesto, if taken too seriously, can spell trouble for the future, especially when the party seems close enough to taking power. the less it reveals about – the more it camouflages – the ideology and character of the party, its real programme, policy agenda, and intentions, its stand on sensitive and highly divisive issues, the better. in the case of the bjp today, what evidently needs to be underplayed, if not kept out of public view, is the sangh parivar’s well-known repertoire of core issues: the concept of hindutva; the project of building a ram temple in ayodhya (on the grave of the babri masjid); the abrogation of article 370, which confers a special constitutional status on jammu & kashmir; coming up with a uniform civil code; banning religious conversions, cow slaughter, and so forth., the irony of it all seems to have escaped general attention. the bjp, after all, is a highly ideologised political entity. it is a member of a volatile family, the “sangh parivar,” which is “nurtured” by the rashtriya swayamsevak sangh, the ideological or conceptual brain directing family affairs. to represent intra-familial relationships in this right-wing communal formation, there is no need to go to any external source. here is how the history section of the bjp’s official website, www.bjp.org, presents the relationships: “the bharatiya janata party is today the most prominent member of the family of organisations known as the ‘sangh parivar’ and nurtured by the rashtriya swayamsevak sangh (rss)…history is the philosophy of nations…the sangh parivar has a very clear…conception of indian history…the rss has no doubt about hindu identity and culture being the mainstay of the indian nation and of indian society.”, the bjp has come a long way since 1984, when it suffered a crushing defeat at the hands of a congress that rode a sympathy wave to an unprecedented electoral triumph. the bjp’s highly ideological nature, its organisational strength, and the depth of reserves provided by its membership of the parivar explain its resilience, its ability to re-invent itself in accordance with changing socio-political circumstances. historically, it began to taste electoral success only after trading its vague and somewhat indeterminate right-wing platform of its formative years (1980-1986) for the platform of aggressive hindutva, adopted at its palampur session in 1989., core hindutva issuesa close look at the bjp’s election manifestoes from 1996, which began the era of the party bidding seriously for power at the centre, shows a consistent pattern of fielding the core hindutva issues, with 1999 constituting the sole exception. the language, the style, and the treatment of the issues vary but the core issues are embedded in the manifestoes. the ideologues evidently saw to this, despite the reported sporadic attempts of a.b. vajpayee to moderate or soften the message., the bjp’s 1998 manifesto is nothing if not outspoken on all the core issues. it speaks of “sanatana dharma as…synonymous with indian nationalism” and commits the party to the concept of “one nation, one people and one culture.” it proclaims that “the evolution of hindutva in politics is the antidote to the creation of vote banks and appeasement of sectional interests.” asserting that “shri ram lies at the core of indian consciousness,” it commits the party to facilitating “the construction of a magnificent shri ram mandir at ram janmasthan in ayodhya where a makeshift temple already exists.” it promises to “explore all consensual, legal and constitutional means to facilitate the construction of shri ram mandir at ayodhya.” as for the special constitutional status of jammu & kashmir, the party’s 1998 manifesto issues a threat: “the bjp will abrogate article 370 of the constitution.” further, it proposes to “entrust the law commission” with the formulation of “a uniform civil code based on the progressive practices from all traditions.”",0.140526793026793,need talk manifesto,"official statement come bharatiya janata party explain strange decision release , face election commission india ’ displeasure , manifesto april 7 , 2014 — first nine ‘poll days ’ constituting 16th general election. , election manifestoes big deal. ’ message seemingly conveyed party , according opinion polls , form next coalition government new delhi , assuming course solve ‘last mile ’ problem finding enough allies connect magic number 272 lok sabha seats. , big deal ‘vikas purush ’ avatar former outlier , chief minister narendra modi , whose campaign machine done everything power obfuscate draw attention away past , 2002 that. needs manifesto modimantra , actually heads list ‘core issues ’ bjp ’ official website , www.bjp.org ? needs manifesto ‘gujarat model ’ governance , development , social engineering rest india needs aspire ?

2014-04-11,development and doublespeak,"for several months mr. narendra modi’s campaign speeches sound as if governance and development are the overarching ideas of his political agenda. his speeches are replete with references to development and no overt references to hindu nationalism. this might suggest that the bharatiya janata party’s (bjp) prime minister-in-waiting has undergone an ideological transformation from his 2002 days. for many observers of indian democracy, this is not surprising because they believe indian politics has a proclivity towards centrism and the bjp cannot escape it; like other parties it will face the same pulls and pressures and will have to take everyone along. this mistaken reading assumes that extremist parties moderate their ideology when they become part of a plural party system and this process is more or less linear. it is true that taking part in electoral competition often encourages political parties to adopt an inclusive agenda but this is not evident from the bjp’s trajectory and certainly not from the 2014 campaign which is marked by doublespeak, innuendo and insinuation. as always, the bjp speaks in two voices: moderation and polarisation., the bjp released its manifesto on april 8 after voting had begun for the first round of the nine-phase election inviting charges of violation of the code of conduct. the much delayed manifesto is full of rhetoric on economic development, reforms, good governance and jobs and so on to satisfy india’s privileged classes as well as appeal to the changing aspirations of the emergent middle class. at the same time, it recommits the party to three core hindutva issues: a ram temple at ayodhya, scrapping of article 370 which guarantees special status of jammu and kashmir, and the demand for a uniform civil code — issues which can polarise the nation., to be sure, the double focus will not please everyone. anyone who has followed mr. modi’s campaign trail cannot miss the larger strategy which is attempting to polarise the electorate. the manifest ideology and the oral tradition communicated through speeches delivered by him and the word of mouth propaganda by the rashtriya swayamsevak sangh (rss) are more important than the manifesto. mr. modi might avoid the hindutva language for which he is known, but through signals, expressions, and symbols he has kept intact his image as the mascot of the hindu right. at a rally in ghaziabad he accused the congress-led united progressive alliance (upa) government of promoting cow slaughter and promoting meat export adding further that the number of slaughterhouses is increasing, and incidents of cattle being stolen from villages are also on a rise. he said: “when the country was waiting for another green revolution, the congress was planning for a ‘pink revolution (meat export)’.” while there is no overt display of hindutva here, the undercurrent cannot be missed as the same political message is being conveyed in a subterranean fashion., the bjp’s campaign in uttar pradesh unmistakably exposes the doublespeak. it is not restricted to economic growth, price rise and corruption and the gujarat model of development as the panacea to the country’s despair with sliding economic growth; rather, it focusses on both development and division. mr. modi talks about development but allows other leaders of his party and the sangh to raise communal issues. after mr. modi’s close aide, mr. amit shah (former home minister of gujarat) took charge of the party’s u.p. campaign, it took a decisive turn toward hindutva which has since become the main plank in the election. thereafter, the sangh intensified its “save cow” campaign and “love jihad” propaganda. while mr. modi proclaims that he is interested only in economic development, mr. shah is telling hindus in western u.p., not surprisingly in by-lanes and not public speeches, that this election was an opportunity to seek “revenge” for the “insult” inflicted during the communal violence in muzaffarnagar, and “that they must not vote for those who give compensation to those who killed jats.” mr. shah’s vitriolic talk is a reminder that polarisation remains the principal instrument of mobilisation. it is the focal point of the u.p. campaign which is central to the bjp’s game plan. mr. modi’s decision to contest from varanasi further underlines u.p.’s importance to the bjp’s national strategy and the keenness of both the bjp and the rss to signal that hindutva will underpin its campaign in this crucial state., periodically, the bjp makes an effort to distinguish itself from its parent organisation, the rss and the sangh parivar. but this time there is nothing separating the bjp from the rss. more than 30 years ago, the janata party government fell over the question of “dual membership” of a political party and the rss. in the decades since, the rss seems to have become more palatable. today, the rss is running the bjp campaign and there are no qualms about it. mr. amit shah has picked rss men as poll coordinators in u.p. these coordinators have been given charge of campaigning and other election-related activities.",0.08448412698412698,development doublespeak,"several months mr. narendra modi ’ campaign speeches sound governance development overarching ideas political agenda. speeches replete references development overt references hindu nationalism. might suggest bharatiya janata party ’ ( bjp ) prime minister-in-waiting undergone ideological transformation 2002 days. many observers indian democracy , surprising believe indian politics proclivity towards centrism bjp cannot escape ;

2014-08-06,lotus bloom in west bengal,"the data: till december 2013, 6.06 per cent of the increased primary members of the bjp were muslims. as of june 20, this number has risen to 12.38 per cent. photo: ronny sen | photo credit: mail pic , “yeh kya ho raha hai? (what is happening?) it is raining alis for the bjp,” tweeted a bharatiya janata party supporter. discussions and statements such as this, arguing the pros and cons of inducting muslims into the bjp, are flying thick and fast on social media, all seeking answers to one question: is the bjp becoming another congress?, in the last six months, especially after the lok sabha election, t>he bjp’s muslim membership has seen an unprecedented growth in west bengal. “primary membership has doubled,” said bjp state president rahul sinha., till december 2013, 6.06 per cent of the “increased” primary members of the bjp were from the minority community. as of june 20, 12.38 per cent (60,172 people) of new members of the party are muslims. “most of the new members joined after the elections,” said ritesh tiwari, media-in-charge of the party in the state., the data may make traditional supporters anxious, but bjp leaders are less worried. “muslims cannot be wished away in bengal,” former state president, tathagata roy, said., out of the 341 development blocks in west bengal, about 140 blocks have a 42 per cent (average) muslim population, which translates into 25-30 per cent votes in the state. “so, we have to explain to supporters that we are not an anti-muslim party. however, we will not extend any undue advantages like ‘religious quota’ to muslims,” said mr. roy., anxiety in the partyan article published in the july 14 edition of swastika, the bengali mouthpiece of the hindu nationalist organisation, the rashtriya swayamsevak sangh (rss), stated that the bjp’s success is “facing a crisis.” analysing the nature of this crisis the writer of the piece argued, “unruly communist party of india(marxist) cadres joined the all india trinamool congress and sidestepped the original aitc workers, thus creating chaos in the party.” without naming any community, the columnist also said “many are migrating to the bjp to create similar chaos,” thereby endorsing the anxiety of the average tweeter., mr. sinha accepted that the minority community’s interest in the bjp is “perhaps unique to bengal” but refused to accept that within the bjp and the rss, many are questioning the policy of inducting muslims. “the cpi(m)’s a.b. ansari arrested later in burdwan wanted to join us;

the cpi(m)’s office was torched. mr. ali’s brother’s cable television network was seized and he left choto jagulia for two years. but he has his past to reconcile with., “do not forget that sadeq was the biggest strongman during cpi(m)’s time,” said qasem molla (name changed), an aitc supporter, while reiterating that the aitc cadres are committing “mistakes.”, “my prayer to didi’s (mamata banerjee’s) brothers is to stop the attacks on the cpi(m). they will increasingly join the bjp, and leftists are adept at conducting polls,” warned mr. mollah. it is now evident in districts across west bengal that muslims and hindus are leaving the left front en masse to join the bjp, as left leaders are failing to guarantee security. but this may not be helping aitc. “in a way, the strategy to decimate the left by force has boomeranged,” said a senior leader of the aifb on condition of anonymity., senior cpi(m) leader nepaldeb bhattacharya said that the muslims, however, are not leaving the party., one of the key muslim faces of the aitc, ahmed hassan imran, a journalist and rajya sabha mp, also echoed the same sentiments., “muslims are not leaving the aitc; we checked facts. only one or two persons have joined the bjp,” he said, also explaining why muslims cannot join the bjp. “none of the bjp’s nearly 300 mps represents the community. neither can the memories of gujarat be erased...but i agree that in some places muslims are targeted…party chief mamata banerjee is looking into the issue,” he said., the bjp’s fault linesduring the election campaign, many bjp candidates said they would “ban cow slaughter and exports along the border,” if elected. the campaign has not gone down well with muslims and even some hindus who survive on both local consumption and export of beef., “beef export or supply is one of the few businesses controlled by muslims. if banned, it may cause problems for the party,” said arif khan (name changed) of tentulia village in north 24 parganas, soon after shifting to the bjp from the congress. a senior bjp leader told the hindu, slaughter “will not be banned” as it may affect the leather industry. “it will affect livelihood and we are aware that the economy has linkages with social harmony,” he said., interestingly, a section of the city’s intelligentsia is not averse to muslims joining the bjp. anthropologist m.k.a. siddiqui welcomed “the trend.” “if a community is keen to learn about a legitimate political party, why is it worrying?” he asked., muslims who are joining the bjp are predominantly from the bengali-speaking communities outside kolkata. in kolkata, muslims are mostly from urdu-speaking communities, more aligned with the aitc., “bengali muslims are tired of non-bengali muslims 9 per cent controlling their thoughts and culture and hence turned to the bjp to have their aspirations addressed,” said sabir ahmed, a senior researcher on minority issues. sadeq ali had another interpretation: west bengal’s muslims stayed with the ruling coalition for security.",0.09701309974747473,lotus bloom west bengal,"data : till december 2013 , 6.06 per cent increased primary members bjp muslims. june 20 , number risen 12.38 per cent. photo : ronny sen &#124;

2014-11-08,dark and dairy: the sorry tale of the milch animals,"beef and milk are two sides of the same coin, especially in india where cattle and buffaloes are farmed primarily for milk. , india has been making national and international headlines for its soaring beef exports., however, while there is ambivalence about india’s place in the beef market, there is more or less unquestioned pride about the nation’s status as the world’s largest producer of milk. we have riots over rumours of cow slaughter. but the consumption of milk and milk products is a near-universal habit in india, probably more so among vegetarians than others. we revere cows as mothers because we use their milk. but if our dairy practices are any indication, we don’t treat our mothers well., it’s clear that meat comes from slaughtered animals. it’s less obvious that dairy production is as traumatic and lethal to animals. beef and milk are two sides of the same coin, especially in india where cattle and buffaloes are farmed primarily for milk. there are no ‘beef’ animals in india. yet, bovine meat constitutes 62 per cent of india’s total meat production. beef, in india, is sourced from the dairy industry, which is economically sustainable only because it is supported by the meat and meat by-products industries (such as leather). therefore, if we care about cattle, we should first look into the lives of milch animals., the dairy system inflicts suffering at every stage, starting with the calving process, for milk comes from a cow or a buffalo that has calved recently. for dairy farming to be financially viable, animals are made to calve at least once a year (for cows) and once in 15 months (for buffaloes). calves, male and female, are separated or significantly restricted from accessing their mothers three to four days after birth. this separation is traumatic for both mother and calf, but leads to a 15-30 per cent increase in milk availability for humans. following separation, calves are mainly fed on milk substitutes and are allowed only limited suckling. the mother’s milk is instead diverted for human consumption., most male calves are either sent for slaughter or let loose to starve. a limited number are used for breeding. some are used as draught animals where they are subject to castration without anaesthesia, nose-roping, whipping and hard labour until they are old and weak. at that point, they are sent for slaughter or abandoned. the economic undesirability of male cattle is evident in the gender imbalance — 64.42 per cent female and 35.57 per cent male in cattle, and 85.18 per cent female and 14.8 per cent male in buffalo. the slaughter of male calves — whether intentional or incidental — is integral to milk production., healthy females are kept alive for use in the dairy industry, which means a repeated cycle of impregnation, separation, painful milking, oxytocin shots and mastitis. to keep dairy animals productive, animal husbandry manuals recommend re-impregnation around 60 days after calving — a longer calving interval is uneconomical and a shorter interval reduces milk production., impregnation is increasingly being carried out through artificial insemination. india’s national dairy plan aims to use artificial insemination on at least 35 per cent of all fertile animals by the end of 2017. artificial insemination involves extracting semen from selected bulls and forcibly placing it in restrained cows. this technology is popular because it is efficient, allows for selective breeding of high-yielding animals and reduces the need for males., dairy farming involves the killing of unproductive, infertile and ‘spent’ cows and buffaloes. milk production starts to decline after three to four lactations (pregnancies). at this stage, cows and buffaloes are sold for slaughter through middlemen, or to a smaller farmer who will use them for an additional two to three lactations before selling them for slaughter or abandoning them. an infertile or unproductive animal shares the same fate, only much earlier. india’s world-beating output of 132.4 million tonnes of milk in 2012-13 would not have been possible if cattle and buffalo were taken care of for the entirety of their natural life-spans., dairy cattle have a terrible choice: life can be nasty, brutish and short, if you are male; or nasty, brutish and longer, if you are female. beef is an inevitable consequence of dairy. the data bear out this hypothesis. figures provided by the national dairy development board show that the monetary value of milk production almost tripled between 2004-05 and 2011-12. so did the monetary value of beef production. there was a 98.6 per cent match between milk and beef production over this period., both qualitatively and quantitatively, a milch cow or buffalo has a worse life than an animal bred solely for meat. why, then, do we believe dairy to be better than beef?, part of the explanation lies in psychology. meat is obviously linked to the death of a fellow- creature. the impacts of dairy are easily veiled in narratives about ‘surplus milk’ and the indian veneration of the cow. of course, buffaloes that provide more than half the milk we consume as a nation don’t figure in these debates.",-0.01786641628413781,dark dairy : sorry tale milch animals,"beef milk two sides coin , especially india cattle buffaloes farmed primarily milk. , india making national international headlines soaring beef exports. , however , ambivalence india ’ place beef market , less unquestioned pride nation ’ status world ’ largest producer milk. riots rumours cow slaughter. consumption milk milk products near-universal habit india , probably among vegetarians others. revere cows mothers use milk. dairy practices indication , ’ treat mothers well. , ’ clear meat comes slaughtered animals. ’ less obvious dairy production traumatic lethal animals. beef milk two sides coin , especially india cattle buffaloes farmed primarily milk. ‘beef ’ animals india. yet , bovine meat constitutes 62 per cent india ’ total meat production. beef , india , sourced dairy industry , economically sustainable supported meat meat by-products industries ( leather ) . therefore , care cattle , first look lives milch animals. , dairy system inflicts suffering every stage , starting calving process , milk comes cow buffalo calved recently. dairy farming financially viable , animals made calve least year ( cows ) 15 months ( buffaloes ) . calves , male female , separated significantly restricted accessing mothers three four days birth. separation traumatic mother calf , leads 15-30 per cent increase milk availability humans. following separation , calves mainly fed milk substitutes allowed limited suckling. mother ’ milk instead diverted human consumption. , male calves either sent slaughter let loose starve. limited number used breeding. used draught animals subject castration without anaesthesia , nose-roping , whipping hard labour old weak. point , sent slaughter abandoned. economic undesirability male cattle evident gender imbalance — 64.42 per cent female 35.57 per cent male cattle , 85.18 per cent female 14.8 per cent male buffalo. slaughter male calves — whether intentional incidental — integral milk production. , healthy females kept alive use dairy industry , means repeated cycle impregnation , separation , painful milking , oxytocin shots mastitis. keep dairy animals productive , animal husbandry manuals recommend re-impregnation around 60 days calving — longer calving interval uneconomical shorter interval reduces milk production. , impregnation increasingly carried artificial insemination. india ’ national dairy plan aims use artificial insemination least 35 per cent fertile animals end 2017. artificial insemination involves extracting semen selected bulls forcibly placing restrained cows. technology popular efficient , allows selective breeding high-yielding animals reduces need males. , dairy farming involves killing unproductive , infertile ‘spent ’ cows buffaloes. milk production starts decline three four lactations ( pregnancies ) . stage , cows buffaloes sold slaughter middlemen , smaller farmer use additional two three lactations selling slaughter abandoning them. infertile unproductive animal shares fate , much earlier. india ’ world-beating output 132.4 million tonnes milk 2012-13 would possible cattle buffalo taken care entirety natural life-spans. , dairy cattle terrible choice : life nasty , brutish short , male ;

2015-03-12,live chat: attack on puthiya thalaimurai,"chennai : 12/03/2015 : for city : two crude bombs were hurled into the offcie of the tamil news channel puthiyathalaimurai at ekkaduthangal early thursday . photo : k. pichumani | photo credit: k_pichumani , the latest attack on tv channel puthiya thalaimurai serves as yet another example of the growing intolerance and efforts to muzzle free speech in tamil nadu. a look at our live discussion on freedom of expression., we have with us, our reporter sruthisagar yamunan, vasundhara sirnate, from the hindu centre for politics and public policy and sudha ramalingam, advocate and noted social activist., 4:59, comment from guest, how far can the government go curb free speech . in era of social network they should walk the talk with free speech rights, 4:59, comment from p.k.senthil kumaran, is our police intelligence so weak to crack a mob which bully a media house on weekly basis?, 5:01, vasundhara sirnate: this government has gone pretty far in recent months to curb free speech and expression. mostly for cultural reasons linked to reasons of public order, 5:01, sruthisagar: in this case, the attack on free speech has been from fringe groups presumably without state support. in this case, the person who has surrendered before a court in madurai claims to be from a little-known group called hindu ilaignar sena., 5:02, vasundhara sirnate: our police strength and level of efficacy differs form state to state. but intelligence failures are still happening although after 26/11, things were said to have become better,, 5:02, comment from dennis s. jesudasan, the very fact that the bomb was hurled in chennai and a person surrendered in madurai within four hours shows how every step has been planned to the finish, 5:03, sudha ramalingam: the right to freedom of speech and expression ought to be protected zealously. but the state now is on a spree to silence as much as the attackers., 5:03, sruthisagar: but that does not absolve the state from its duty to protect free speech. a duty which the police has failed to do in this incident., 5:03, vasundhara sirnate: before we jump to any conclusions about this particular issue, let me flag a couple of points. it is true that these are rogue elements. however, many such groups across india are drawing their power socially just by the mere fact that there is a right-wing ggovernment in power, which has often reflected a more masculine form of hindutva., 5:04, comment from albert devakaram, attacks on freedom of press seems to be frequent in india. what steps can we take to curb this menace?, 5:04, vasundhara sirnate: if i were to look at the big picture i would say that along side legal curbing of free speech and expression, there are these social groups which are now trying to act as 'bahubalis' or enforcers of the political will., 5:04, sudha ramalingam: true vasundhara but even when we had the nda in power we saw the deterioration and intolerance, 5:05, sudha ramalingam: i feel that the publicity and coverage negative news gets promotes a culture of violence, 5:05, vasundhara sirnate: yes we did. however, in recent months the censorship we are seeing of citizens and their speech and expression has become more pronounced., 5:05, comment from senthil, whether the media has the rights to discuss on the tradition which they are following for these many years in name of freedom of speech, 5:06, vasundhara sirnate: in the us, freedom of the press is a bit different from freedom of speech available to citizens., 5:06, comment from albert devakaram, the fringe elements need to be nipped in the bud., 5:06, vasundhara sirnate: this is because the press is seen as the pillar that holds up both state and society. we don't really have that in india. we don't have special protection for the press., 5:07, sudha ramalingam: discussions now are no more rational or unbiased they are moderated by vested interests fanning the intolerant, 5:07, vasundhara sirnate: fringe elements are a long standing reality in india. they have always existed. however, the last two decades have seen an intensification of such elements., 5:07, sruthisagar: what is quite disconcerting is how organisations owing allegiance to the extreme right have suddenly become very proactive in a state like tamil nadu. starting with the perumal murugan issue, a number of incidents of social censorship have been witnessed in a matter of few months. there is a pattern emerging which the state has to realise quickly., 5:08, comment from sundar, in the name of freedom of speech, can anyone ignore the sentiments of religion and wound them?, 5:08, vasundhara sirnate: actually i think citizens need to understand this pattern faster. the state knows exactly what it is doing. this is a very clever state., 5:09, sudha ramalingam: words do not break bones. what is wounding sentiments, hearing the other side is basic principle of justice., 5:09, comment from sundar, needs a clear answer..., 5:09, comment from prabu, press sovereignty should be kept alive ,,,whom so ever should be punished, 5:09, vasundhara sirnate: so yes there are restrictions on freedom of speech. however, we must understand that when it comes to religion, even if i say something innocuous and innocent, someone on the planet will get offended. so for me the question becomes, why don't people have the emotional capacity to deal with someone offending them. i am offended everyday by so many things in india (not linked to religion), but i deal with it because i know things can be better,, 5:09, comment from guest, perhaps this is the result of pent up emotions..., 5:10, comment from guest, what is the meaning of n e w s, 5:10, comment from p.k.senthil kumaran, is the deep rooted caste ism join hands with religious extremism in recent days (take the example of perumal murugan and other writers)? politics, policies, education system in recent past paved way for the superficial in-tolerant society., 5:10, comment from sundar, if the words affect an individual, will anyone go smiling as said by thiruvalluvar?, 5:10, sruthisagar: social practices should not be immune to scrutiny and debate. in the puthia thalaimurai case, what frustrated the fringe elements was a debate on the relevance/need of mangalsutra/thali for women. this is a legitimate topic of debate and in fact is not a new one. tamil nadu was the pioneer of self-respect marriages which recognised and gave legal status to marriages without rituals., 5:11, comment from albert devakaram, agreed religious sentiments ought o be respected, but we must remember that the right to freedom of speech is fundamental and needs to be protected at all times and in all circumstances., 5:11, comment from vinu pillai, it's really cruel that some miscreants are ruining the humanitarian structure of the society. how long they want to keep public in shadow and keep them away from reality. attacking is always condemned., 5:12, sruthisagar: without debate, reforms are impossible., 5:12, sudha ramalingam: mangalsutra is not a must in the hindu marriage at all, it is the saptapati which is an important element for hindu mariage, 5:13, sudha ramalingam: yes debates are necessary but not the ones the media is promoting of late. healthy debates should put forth both sides of the coin., 5:13, comment from sundar, pt exceeded their limit.., 5:13, comment from ramasubramanian, this channel has the habit of always taking subjects which are harming one religion and debeators were also have the negative and one sided view about the religion without knowing what it is, 5:13, comment from senthil, if the pt have the gut to have the discussions on the dressings and the life style few religion in the name of freedom of speech, 5:13, comment from deepa, there was an earlier report that a vijay tv talk show on burqa was not allowed to be filmed. but, many mainstream media didn't take it up then. is the intensity of media coverage directly proportional to the severity of the assault?, 5:14, comment from guest, govt will again say that no one will be spare but actually everyone will be spare, 5:14, comment from albert devakaram, what is the significance of saptapati?, 5:14, comment from khalid ahmed, attacking is not good in taste, it should be condemned, 5:14, comment from senthil, reforms is needed only the growth of the nation not in the religious things, 5:14, sudha ramalingam: taking seven steps around the 'holy fire', 5:14, comment from guest, ""if the pt have the gut to have the discussions on the dressings and the life style few religion in the name of freedom of speech"" @ senthil.. i second it., 5:15, comment from krishna, it's not that because nda is in power these things are happening. films like the da vinci code and dam 999 was banned when the congress was power., 5:15, comment from namrata, i believe attacking someone/an idea/a debate comes about not because of any sense of cultural confidence but from a deep sense of insecurity and aggression which is then dominated by a desire to control, 5:15, sruthisagar: the channel did not exceed any limit. the channel was attacked even before the debated was aired. how can someone claim to be offended even without watching the debate? secondly, if one has a problem with the content, there are legal channels for remedy., 5:15, comment from r nagarajan, the so called media have guts only to make program against the beliefs of hindu religion and they do not have guts to touch other religions' beliefs, 5:16, sudha ramalingam: who are we to say what the topic of discussion must be. one has the option to switch off the tv or participate in the debate for these days many shows have options for viewers to call and participate, 5:16, comment from albert devakaram, irrespective of the party in power attacks on press freedom continues unabated., 5:16, comment from krishna, nobody protested when the da vinci code was banned citing ""hurting religious sentiments"", 5:16, comment from p.k.senthil%20kumaran, progressive society debates the difference, not hurls bombs at each other. we have seen enough examples of in-tolerance and its catastrophes all over the world. learn or perish, that's two options we have., 5:16, comment from karthikeya pawar, will fringe elements ever be punished or will the government preserve it's vote base and not do anything?, 5:17, sudha ramalingam: putting the cart before the horse has become the norm. asking for censorship, banning publications or releases before reading the book or seeing the movies or documentaries have come to stay, 5:17, comment from dennis s. jesudasan, someone here said the pt exceeded their limit. i think when you set a limit, it called controlled media and public relations. it's not journalism. media needs to be free and if not scams or other scandals would not have even seen the light of the day, 5:17, comment from guest, freedom of press under threat!, 5:17, comment from partha, how is social reform related to a faith having thaali is against the reform? reformulation from what to what? if self respect is about defying such faiths, so should it be with any faith/religion. why did pt not touch up on other practices in other religions?, 5:17, comment from kasthuri rangan, it has become the habit of attacking the hindu faith and customs. if hindus are ok with it what is wrong and what affects others., 5:18, comment from p.k.senthil%20kumaran, its not just taxes shouldn't be retrospective, our thought process too!, 5:18, sruthisagar: newspapers did criticise the ban on da vinci code. here is the editorial the hindu wrote after the ban- >http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/joining-the-wrong-side/article3113731.ece, 5:18, comment from karthikeyan, will honest probe will be conducted for who did this ?.., 5:18, comment from khalid ahmed, ban culture in india is growing...it's really disgusting, 5:18, sudha ramalingam: thaali is not restricted to any particular religious faith. even non-hindus wear thali, 5:18, comment from krishna, did any channel debated when a kerala professsor's hands were chopped off by religious fundemantalists?. i think the selective condemnation results in the rise of right-wing politics., 5:18, comment from keerthi kanth, all customs of hinduism can be debated. if it improves rational thinking then fine., 5:19, sudha ramalingam: you cannot expect debates on all dissent., 5:19, comment from albert devakaram, yes, even christian brides wear it and treasure it till ""death do part us"", 5:19, comment from krishna, mr. sagar agreed. but you can see the ferociousness and intensity of these intellectuals when some form of aggression is shown by hindutva groups., 5:19, comment from kasthuri rangan, mr. jesudasan if the same tv host a show on jesus and the myth around him will you feel the same freedom of speech? if so i can appreciate it. in the name of secularism one cannot continously attack a native religion. first condemn it, 5:19, vasundhara sirnate: but this is the issue here. people jump to conclusions with very little information., 5:19, comment from ishwar, society isn't matured enough for such debates.especially in highly caste conscious states like tamil nadu. such debates happen in kerala where tv channels lampoon politicians. but freedom of speech has its own reasonable limits., 5:19, comment from khalid ahmed, yes selective condenmation results in rise of right wing poliitics @krishna, 5:20, comment from r nagarajan, the same channel puthiya thalaimurai on deepavali day last year made a programme ""is deepavali a tamil festival?"". they will not do program whether christmas or ramzan tamil festival. they know if they do such program, what would be the consequences', 5:20, comment from sundar, when it is a debate, we have to answer all proposals., 5:20, sudha ramalingam: yes vasundhara... just knee jerk reactions with just very minimal information., 5:20, comment from prabhakar jayaprakash, bjp and rss have started deciding what to wear, what to discuss, and how many children to give birth to, and what programme to telecast in tv channels. the country is heading in a bad direction. if people are not ready to listen, then, call them anti-national, anti-secular, or whatever. now, they have started a new trend of throwing bomb at those who are functioning against their ideologies. i guess this is the ""acha din agaya"" that singh was referring to., 5:20, comment from p.k.senthil kumaran, anything evolves only if it withstand criticism. or else it can only be a artifact which will go to museum., 5:20, comment from karthikeya pawar, will indian society ever become as appreciative and protective of individual freedom as the countries in the west?, 5:21, comment from sri sri, bombs are hurled even on embassies, immediate justice is what the agitating people require. if promised with such measures, i think we can see the change in people's way of thinking. its not about freedom of press or speech., 5:21, comment from khalid ahmed, yes rss is calling the shots now, 5:21, comment from sundar, activists need not think they are the protectors of the society.., 5:21, comment from r nagarajan, keerthi kanth - why do you target to discuss only hindu customs? will you discuss the customs of other videshi religions - islam and christianity?, 5:21, sruthisagar: the same channel ran extensive debates on the controversy surrounding an ias officer who also claims to be an evangelist with powers of miracles. the accusation that the media targets a particular religion is baseless., 5:22, comment from deepa, perumal murugan, puliyur murugesan and puthiya thalaimurai. the tn government is silent till now. neither the cm nor any ministers seem to have spoken anything about it. can the judiciary step in under such circumstances?, 5:22, comment from albert devakaram, press freedom is in danger in the west too. it is not limited to india., 5:22, comment from krishna, but will ""thali"" debate solve all ills facing the tamil society? why debates at this just to improve your trps? can't you debate issues people face in their day-to-day life?. but alas, that cannot ensure your viewership?, 5:22, comment from indian, ok the right wing has started dictating what we should not eat (beef), what we should not see, what we should not discuss, how many children to have..etc, 5:22, vasundhara sirnate: yes.. it is now a global phenomenon as states assume more power leading to state's that are more concerned about order and security than about guaranteeing freedom, 5:23, comment from krishna, well said albert. we have been attacks on sikhs, hindu temples in the u.s., racial attack in australia..., 5:23, comment from ramasubramanian, why they are always taking cultural issues of one religion why can'nt they take up the issues of corruption/civil and power and developmental problems in tn on the politics of aiadmk/dmk if they take it and debate they will get it from both the parities, 5:23, sudha ramalingam: no debate will solve any issue, they are healthy to tools to social change .. a medium to stir people's thinking / conscience, 5:23, comment from albert devakaram, the media doesn't target any creed. it reports events as they unfold., 5:23, comment from guest, only hindus have tolerance, 5:24, comment from indian, looks like talimbanization of india has started ....they attach and then proudly claim the responsibility...just the way taliban does. with bjp in power fringe groups got courage to do what ever they want, 5:24, comment from prabhakar jayaprakash, neither jayalalitha or admk will open their mouth about any of the atrocities that rss and bjp involved in until the ""the judgment day"" :p the state is in a bad shape since her arrest., 5:25, comment from karthikeya pawar, @sundar and neither should right wing groups think they are the protectors of morality and culture., 5:25, comment from ragav, for the sake of trp ratings these channels are unnecessarily taking up topics like thali which is part of our culture. why should topic be discussed? next time they will talk about poonool, namam, burqa, the dress worn by pastor,etc. all these topics should be avoided and focus on sanitation, cleanliness, corruption, nation's progress, etc., 5:25, comment from guest, why dont they make a program like purqa is important or not?, 5:25, comment from keerthi kanth, to those who oppose debating on hinduism: must remember, crux of hinduism is tolerance & openness., 5:25, comment from mohideen, if freedom of speech needs to be censored, i think hereafter everyone has to write in a paper what he is going to speak and get certificate from government, 5:25, comment from khalid ahmed, rssisation of india has started, 5:25, comment from albert devakaram, all of us tolerate to the extent possible and blare out only when things seem to go out of hand., 5:25, comment from sundar, is it activists vs activists (so cald fringe elements)?, 5:25, sudha ramalingam: we have sadly become a state which has come too far away from periyar. no rational thinking.. hysterical expressions of sympathies for wrong doers. open support to the corrupt, justification of excesses etc., 5:26, comment from guest, they already talked about burq in vijay tv sometime back., 5:26, comment from abhishek, if only all of us could pratice a little tolerance., 5:26, comment from krishna, but attacking those who are ideologically opposite is unacceptable., 5:27, sudha ramalingam: no one can be the protector of the society individually it is a collective effort.. surely activists take the risk, spend their time and energy for positive mobilization, 5:27, comment from abhishek, how do such goons have such confidence and freedom?, 5:28, comment from obby, whts going on in the country??, 5:28, comment from vasumathi, can someone explain how admk/bjp are related to this incident??, 5:28, comment from bond, @keerthi so you mean just because hindus are tolerant, you can keep on criticising them? just because you are afraid of getting bombed, you wont talk about other religions? that is hypocrisy at its best, 5:28, comment from partha, @sudha ramalingam.. what is rational thinking? is it just iconoclastic? unfortunately, ""rational"" word has been used by a narrow minded pseudo left wing socialist cultural racists.., 5:28, vasundhara sirnate: we basically need more logic and reasoning in public discourse. this is sorely missing. some god man says something and thousands agree., 5:28, comment from shan, rowdyism on rise, will engulf the society if tolerance is not practiced, 5:28, comment from albert devakaram, tamil nadu is by and large a peaceful state governed by peace-loving people, and administered by like-minded bureaucrats., 5:29, comment from indian, and no one calls them terrorist...because they are not muslims, 5:29, vasundhara sirnate: tamil nadu has not had religious violence, but there have been many cases of caste riots as far back as the 1950s and 60s., 5:29, comment from krishna, just like you say that eating habits or religion is a personal affair, the mangalsutra is also a personal affair. why debate on it. whether to wear ""thali"" in the neck or put on the coatstand, is purely an individual's choice. why intrude into that?, 5:29, comment from ahmed, if people (women) are allowed to reveal their bodies as a symbol of freedom of expression why should there be hue and cry if they wear burqa, it is not their freedom double standards, 5:29, comment from sam, the debate is on hindutva, not hinduism .... every religion has fundamentalists and the ""us"" vs ""them"" mentality should be against the fundamentalists, not to those of other religions., 5:29, sudha ramalingam: there has been religious violence in the past too.. jains vs. hindus etc, 5:30, comment from albert devakaram, caste riots will always be there since adam's days. difficult to wipe them off the face of this earth., 5:30, comment from sri, should this pt guys had said something on islam, our muslim bros would have put out a fatwa for killing them. and if for christians the hindu and others are there to put the pt guy in media trials. so who is left over is only hindus. its is good, however, becoz, hinduism will evolve, as always, and remain, true to its original nomenclature, a sanatana dharam, eternal one!, 5:30, sudha ramalingam: religion per se is like opium as marx said, 5:30, comment from karthikeya pawar, people who say that cultural and religious beliefs are above freedom of speech should understand that we live in a democracy and not in a theocracy., 5:30, comment from dude, jains vs hindus ? jains are a subset of hindus, 5:30, vasundhara sirnate: a free woman is seen as a threat to the structure of the family. this is why she must be trapped and controlled through cultural chains., 5:30, comment from indian, if you dont like what tv is going to show then tell them and protest in a peaceful manner.... you cannot resort to violance.... that is bad, 5:31, comment from srinivas, religion is a myth. the sooner people realize this, the better. throwing bombs on behalf of medieval superstitious thought or having arguments on the same is a waste of time. and nothing in the universe is free from critical thought., 5:31, comment from ahmed, agree sam's views, 5:31, comment from ishwar, under indian law, the freedom of speech and of the press do not confer an absolute right to express one's thoughts freely.clause (2) of article 19 of the indian constitution enables the legislature to impose certain restrictions on free speech under following heads: i. security of the state, ii. friendly relations with foreign states, iii. public order, iv. decency and morality, v. contempt of court, vi. defamation, vii. incitement to an offence, and viii. sovereignty and integrity of india., 5:31, vasundhara sirnate: riots can be wiped out and stopped. what we need is an active police that acts to stop violence. we don't have that., 5:31, comment from sam, @bond - religion always invites both praise and criticism. normal people don't just use violence against such ""criticisms"". only fundamentalists, like the sangh parivar or the jihadi outfits use violence for political purpose ..., 5:31, comment from karthik, we don't live in a ideal society. though many of us may like to live in a classless and uniform society, it is biologically and scientifically impossible to have such one. so these things happen! better to educate everyone about what is life and why are we here than anything!, 5:31, comment from partha, caste is everything in tn. each dominant caste has their own newspapers and tvs. dravidian parties field only dominant caste members in elections. it is not the universal dravidianism of sangam period, but parochial feudal groupism. tn had witnessed enormously many caste clashes big or small in the last 500 years., 5:32, comment from keerthi kanth, @bond: hinduism survived criticism for more than 2500 years because hindus ignore what others have to say about it. they know to ignore others in religion terms, 5:32, vasundhara sirnate: see this for more on policing and riots., >http://www.thehinducentre.com/publications/policy-watch/article5656731.ece, 5:32, sudha ramalingam: police is not allowed to be neutral, they are made to take the side of the ruling party. the honest neutral officers are shifted out from sensitive postings, 5:32, comment from albert devakaram, everyone in the country, including the media, enjoys the fundamental right to freedom of speech guaranteed to us by the indian constitution under article 19(1a) and the tamil tv channel was using this right to promote a healthy debate, 5:32, vasundhara sirnate: my research on policing during riots shows that when police dont act quickly death tolls go up., 5:32, comment from jaisuresh, while there is no question the attacks on pt is barbaric, i also denounce the choice of pt for the debate. there are numerous superstitions in hinduism that needs to be debated and 'thali' is one of the most sensitive, if not the most sensitive., 5:33, vasundhara sirnate: when they act, people are alive. when police follow the law and make arrests, riots stop, 5:34, comment from guest, we tamils shouldn't allow any religious forces to cripple our tamilhood ! bjp & co had a good chance of utilizing the political vacuum in tn.. unfortunately their main agenda seems to be only hinduism, hindi, sanskrit !, 5:34, comment from albert devakaram, there are always two factions of the police in tamil nadu. one is popular with the ruling party and the other with the main opposition party, this is the trend fro, the past thirty years., 5:34, comment from lakshminarasimhachari krishnan, puthiya thalaimurai have guts to debate on muslim like dressing burka is bad or good. or doing sunnath is wanted or not wanted., 5:34, vasundhara sirnate: the police people i spoke to did say that when they face political interference they cannot do their jobs., 5:35, comment from karthikeya pawar, when people become afraid of talking about sensitive issues, it results in death of free speech. people do not need free speech to talk about something that everyone is comfortable with., 5:36, comment from guest, yes, hinduism allows all the criticism and debate you can level on it. but when the same amount of criticism and debate are not allowed with other religions, then there is no equal playing field. it becomes onesided. everyone starts criticising only one set of people., 5:36, comment from tamilan, if all religion critized equally.. then these goondass will accept it seems .. pls do it so media, 5:36, comment from guest, indian. the only thing should be in our mind...let the people be as they want., 5:36, comment from nagoorkani.a, it show's the growing threat of freedom of expression, hopefully our state government need to protect the rights of the people. after the bjp formed the central government their are lot of issues which are coming up against from this right wing groups, they are trying to make ourselves to follow their ideas. we need to fight hard to get our fundamental rights., 5:36, comment from nagoorkani.a, it show's the growing threat of freedom of expression, hopefully our state government need to protect the rights of the people. after the bjp formed the central government their are lot of issues which are coming up against from this right wing groups, they are trying to make ourselves to follow their ideas. we need to fight hard to get our fundamental rights., 5:36, comment from jaisuresh, @lakshminarasimhachari krishnan, i could think of provocative topics also. please avoid such statements and please avoid give these trp monsters ideas., 5:37, comment from indian, guys raising burqa issue please note that there is enough discussed abused, banned, allowed etc etc happend on burqa... but who ever believes in it are not affected by this and they are wearing it..., 5:37, sudha ramalingam: police is definitely overworked, under paid and made to support the ruling party.... unless the praksh singh judgment of the supreme court is executed in letter and spirit we will not have a police with moral high ground, 5:37, comment from ishwar, media tend to blow up perumal murugan connecting it with hindutva. issues behind perumal murugan were different from casteism to economical., 5:37, comment from sam, @vasundhara sirnate - i believe you are right - the coimbatore riots happened because the police didn't step in immediately to control the situation .... the sangh parivar was able to take advantage of this and fuel it further ... by the time the police swung into action to control the situation, the al umma jihadi fundamentalist took over from the rss and continued to foster further chaos ..., 5:37, comment from belovedbrother, thaali for that case any such ""women only"" markers of marital status should go. there is no need for martial status markers at all!, 5:37, comment from tamilan, if the govt have stood up for viswaroopam and hell bent on islamic parties, this wouldnt have occurred. freedom of speech started from that issue. davinci code, innocence of muslims, viswaroopam etc, 5:37, vasundhara sirnate: we are a slowly radicalizing society, 5:37, comment from keerthi kanth, violence by fringe elements is always done to bring divide...so, we all have to stand together..ignore religious divides and believe in peaceful existence, 5:39, comment from kasthuri rangan, mr.naggoorkani , will you allow a discussion on burqa and the wedding practice to be debated? pl. answer honestly. this is the nation of hindus where other religions are allowed and appreciated which doesnot mean the host religion should accept trampling over them, 5:39, comment from guest, puthiya thamilagam to attract more viewers sensational debates are organised and the topics hurting the sentiments of majority of the people is highly condemned., 5:39, sudha ramalingam: i know how innocents are targeted and pushed to extremism / terrorism by the state filing false cases and also using them against each other, 5:39, comment from nagoorkani.a, puthiya thalaimurai is the only neutral tv in tamilnadu, there are doing real social work to the people of tamil nadu, they are taken many issues which are necessary, hopefully they need to continue their work without any fear, we are with u., 5:39, comment from belovedbrother, the funniest fact is da vinci code went on without trouble in so called ""christian"" countries. seems religiosity is infecting minorities too., 5:39, comment from krishna b, i think, media should not busy in creating tensions in the society, better thay should focus on healthy common topics for debate rather than any religion faiths or belief's, 5:39, comment from belovedbrother, @vasundhara: not slowly. actively radicalizing society, 5:39, comment from indian, do we have a link to the program the tv channel broadcasted? lets see it before commenting on it, lets be impartial, 5:39, comment from akshay, true, 5:40, vasundhara sirnate: well yes we should see it. but my point is, why ban something.. anything. unless it propagates hate speech actively against a group or an indovidual nothing should be banned, 5:41, vasundhara sirnate: last week alone we banned the following, 1. india's daughter, 2. dirty politics release, 3. beef in maharashtra, 4. no parties in karnataka where foreigners are present without police, 5. 50 shades of grey, 5:41, comment from karthikeya pawar, @vasundhara i agree, 5:41, comment from ishwar, more than 65 years after independence, people are radicalised in one way or other, either its is by religion, caste, ideology or politics. in that case, tamil nadu is no different from bihar., 5:41, comment from daphine, it is nothing to do with religion, its outrageous use of violence means to show one's power. it must be condemned and the accused should be arrested and sent to jail., 5:41, comment from guest, why the the hindu is giving so important to it, 5:41, comment from albert devakaram, the coimbatore riots took place, perhaps because the hands of the police were tied and they were unable to control the situation., 5:41, comment from belovedbrother, if someone thinks thaali is useless, is it wrong to say that on tv? is it wrong to publicize it? even if it is wrong, throwing bombs is the way to reply that argument? why not file a case? do these people have any respect for the law of the land? do they have any right to claim that they have patriotism and respect for culture?, 5:41, comment from ramasubramanian, even before there was attacks on the media during ddmk and aiadmk governments rule those media's are still in business, their rights and freedom are not suppressed and this happens to every media and pt is now trying to encash this and enlarge its market., 5:41, vasundhara sirnate: giving importance to what?, 5:42, vasundhara sirnate: thank you beloved brother. this is the crux of the matter., even if one is deeply offended by something, should you attack with bombs and guns? remember charlie hebdo? what is the difference betweent his and that?, 5:43, vasundhara sirnate: it is fear of the attacks and consequences that also compromises the quality of journalism. we don't have fearless journalism in this country anymore., 5:43, sudha ramalingam: nothing justifies use of violence. violence is no answer to any issue, 5:44, comment from laurent pugazhendhi, on few occasions the target is an innocent victim. most times the target is one who has done the same to others. yet the liberty to speak one's thoughts has not received the honour it should receive. not just india, the world follows this. we always blame someone else for such acts. we lack the self-analysis to know how can i set this right! lets wait for that realization., 5:44, comment from ashish, caste democracy is running in tn. it must be stopped., 5:44, comment from ishwar, the ban on films and cow slaughter beef were through court orders or through legislation., 5:45, comment from sam, @kasturi rangan - this not a nation of hindus, like you may well desire, but a nation of billion people who practice whatever religion they want to and is home to thousands of culture., 5:45, comment from belovedbrother, whatever it may be! if you are offended at least sue the offending party. that shows that you are civilized., 5:45, comment from indian, @vasundhara sirnate:... govts major job seems to be banning, 5:45, comment from krishna b, many anti-social elements in our society waiting for an opportunity to create tension in the society. those elements are not bothered about religion, they don't want to see peaceful state, 5:45, vasundhara sirnate: the sense i get is that our quality of democracy is really slipping. and people don't realise that the liberals of this country will leave if things continue this way. they have the option of exit. just like the liberals in afghanistan and iraq and iran all fled to the west. what wa sleft behind in these countries were the fundamentalists in power. and we see how democracy works there., 5:45, comment from guest, bjp & co seems to have found a strategy to polarize the voters on religious basis is the only way to establish itself in tn & win elections ! they know, they can't directly unite all the hindus because of castsim ( bjp & co. accepts caste). so only way to unite the hindus is to create an imaginary impression that the very common sensitive sentiments of hindus are endangered ! in that case hindus will come under one umbrella ! judicial system should also investigate whether that particular debate itself was planned by bjp & co to stage a drama !, 5:45, comment from belovedbrother, what culture allows let alone encourages throwing bombs?, 5:45, sudha ramalingam: we do not have fearless politics, judiciary or bureaucracy or any other pillar of democracy. we are now surrounded by intolerant elements being fanned with heroic postures, 5:45, comment from sam, @ishwar - really? the suspect arrested claims to be the president of the ""hindu illaignar sena"", related to the sangh parivar ... and has also made statements similar to what all sangh fundamentalists make ... how again is the media ""blowing"" this out of proportion?, 5:45, comment from karthikeya pawar, the first step to stop the radicalization of our society is to implement complete separation of state and religion., 5:45, comment from belovedbrother, @vasundhara, we never had fearless anything in this country, 5:46, comment from keerthi kanth, banning is legal under article 19...just because govt bans some videos doesn't mean govt is curbing our freedom of speech...friends, even greatest democracy(self-proclaimed) usa bans videos n intrudes privacy of others..., 5:46, comment from albert devakaram, it now looks as though we need a ministry of bans , both at the centre and in the states, to oversea the implementation of bans on various things., 5:46, sudha ramalingam: yes separation of state from religion is a must. secularism is the most misunderstood term, 5:46, vasundhara sirnate: we do have a fearless supreme court at least., 5:47, vasundhara sirnate: banning is allowed for reasons of public order and subject to reasonable restrictions. these are unreasonable restrictions, 5:47, comment from rajeev, @guest should know that hinduism is not related to ""hindi"" language, do'nt try to give debate another dividing twist between north & south. india's integrity despite of diverse culture & core democracy is one of the most precious gift. you would surprise to know that currently spoken'hindi"" across north india is an urban language,villages,interior of north india have hundreds of local dialects which are their mother tongue but over the years as mahatma gandhiji expressed once that this urban language may be termed as 'hindustani"" mixture of words from all languages., 5:48, comment from tamilan, so none is ready accept the fundamentalism in their religion.. instead they want criticise all religion equally. so that no one will take upper hand, its funny !! worst thing is all these fundamentalism starts from bloody educated people.., 5:48, sudha ramalingam: reasonable restrictions should be on genuine reasons not just some illogical apprehensions, 5:48, comment from jaisuresh, as much truth is there in the sensitiveness of thali, so much is there that women today don't hesitate to part with them, if circumstances demand., 5:48, vasundhara sirnate: the usa only bans things when the promote hate speech. this is not allowed. even then the threshold for banning is very very high. the us gov cannot force facebook for instance to take down a page. remember wiki is now suing the us government too for privacy infringement., 5:48, comment from indian, ok guys one final word from me.... lets not give any importaqnce to these guys... lets be united the way were were in the past that will give fitting reply to these guys, 5:48, comment from albert devakaram, different people interpret secularism differently suiting their own convenience., 5:48, comment from guest, there are more important things to discuss like safety of women, sanitation, corruption, pollution. the useless channels are taking up useless topics to stir controversy & increase their ratings, 5:48, comment from belovedbrother, what is ""reasonable"" differs from person to person., 5:49, comment from dinesh, take it easy it is a low intensity cracker. however its a warning to the tv channel. india is a democracy all religions have a right to protest like this. not only one particular community is doing every time., 5:49, comment from sam, @albert devakaram - no the coimbatore riots happened because a police man was killed by someone from the minority group, and while the administration was trying to decide how to handle this, the sangh parivar fanned rumours that the administration was trying to protect the culprit because it was election time ... they were thus able to take advantage of the indecisiveness of the administration and use the police anger for their political purposes (which was to communlaise the issue) ... and it paid of great political dividends for the sangh / bjp .... for the first time, it was able to win an election from tamil nadu., 5:49, comment from srinivas, banning of religion is a must, more like, 5:49, comment from karthikeya pawar, let's hope the supreme court one day interprets the word secular in our preamble to mean separation of state and religion. till then communal politics will go on unabated., 5:49, vasundhara sirnate: the criterion on reasonableness has been defined and interpreted by many court cases. one only has to look through ""manupatra"" and find those., 5:49, comment from abhisek parichha, the question should be why was the channel attacked? was it political, communal, religious or random ?, 5:49, comment from murugan, what does qualify as reasonable restrictions?, 5:49, comment from ishwar, all political parties use caste and religion for political gains. even in so-called progressive state like kerala, political parties including cpi_m nominate candidates based on their caste and religion., 5:50, comment from krishna, @sudha ramalingam. shocked to see a reference to periyar on ""tolerance"". he is one who broke vinayaga idols, put chappals on lord rama's pictures. such was his ""rationalism"", asked his followers to beat a particular community instead of a snake.., 5:50, vasundhara sirnate: reasonable retsictions, security of the state,, ii. friendly relations with foreign states,, iii. public order,, iv. decency and morality,, v. contempt of court,, vi. defamation,, vii. incitement to an offence, and, viii. sovereignty and integrity of india., 5:50, comment from guest, i don't think banning anything is a solution., 5:51, vasundhara sirnate: from time to time the criterion of reasonableness has changed. but now most times they use ""public order and decency and morality""., 5:51, comment from albert devakaram, of all the tamil channels, puthyia thalaimurai is by and large impartial and balanced. one cannot question its integrity., 5:51, vasundhara sirnate: please be informed, read some history. tamilnadu has had good number of religious violence in coimbatore, chennai and madurai. there are still some muslim localities where even police think twice to enter, if insecurity is the reason for such happenings, then who has created that insecurity. the political parties who consider non-hindus as vote banks and always try to appease them by bashing hindus and hindu traditions, 5:51, comment from naru, violence cannot be justified. it is the one sided criticism that is wrong. when there were charges against a god man, nityananda, there was violence unleashed on him and his ashram by 'intellectuals' - was that ok? was it condemned? (all the charges proved baseless and dismissed in the court), 5:51, vasundhara sirnate: please be informed, read some history. tamilnadu has had good number of religious violence in coimbatore, chennai and madurai. there are still some muslim localities where even police think twice to enter, 5:52, comment from ishwar, all these years after independence , we don't have a uniform civil code. fifty per cent of problems could be solved if we had a uniform civil code like in developed countries. but our politicians might not like it., 5:52, comment from keerthi kanth, @nagarajan: hindu customs are debated regularly because we are majority...debates on other religions are not raised frequently but needed.....you don't expect debate on hinduism in rome/saudi/israel. do you?, 5:52, vasundhara sirnate: have read history. only few of these were signifcant enough for an inquiry commission, 5:53, sudha ramalingam: let us ask for uniform civil code, but let us not fight and hurl bombs at each other to get what we want, 5:53, vasundhara sirnate: the ucc may not solve all problems. at the heart of this matter is not only freedom of speech and expression, but also gender relations and this desire to control women., 5:53, comment from raja, this is unfortunate... death of democracy, 5:53, comment from tamilan, soon..... india will become hindu pakistan !!!!!, 5:54, comment from sankar, i feel mangalsutra is one which belongs to sexism of the past and must be done away with. it is good to have a debate on it. there is no way you can attack a neutral sane tamil channel for this., 5:54, vasundhara sirnate: in the northeast many don;t want a ucc becuase women will lose rights that they have under customary tribal law., 5:54, comment from ravi, all these people employed in the sena's etc etc are there for a reason. why would a normal working class fella don't pay attetion to aspects that these guys focus on? because most of us are busy. so what the governemt need to do is educate every individual, teach the role of religion in our society and its limits from very early ages. also providing proper job opportunities will deviate all these people joining silly sena's ete etc and help them to lead a normal fruitfull lives by doing some job., 5:54, comment from srinivas, the minute one talks about ""reasonable"" restrictions, the battle for free speech is lost. who decides reasonableness or lack thereof? vulgarity could become an excuse for defence even in this case., 5:54, comment from belovedbrother, if i want to eat beef, pork, marry an adult of my own sex with consent, may i know how and in what way these things hurt someone else sentiments?, 5:54, sudha ramalingam: hindu customs are debated in our country because they are the concerns of majority of its population, let it not be made a reason to deny healthy debates, 5:54, comment from murugan, but morality is highly subjective!, 5:55, comment from nagoorkani.a, tamil nadu need to ban this group who attacked puthiya thalaimurai, 5:55, vasundhara sirnate: i don't know why indians are so quick to take offence. but somehow being gay etc really angers people here and across the world. i don't know why., 5:55, sudha ramalingam: we need to inculcate a culture of tolerance, honesty and make intolerant / violent behavour an offence., 5:55, vasundhara sirnate: those things are already offences., 5:56, comment from belovedbrother, @ravi, osama is educated. so i don't think education can fix this., 5:56, vasundhara sirnate: we need clear laws for hate speech, 5:56, comment from srinivas, the uniform civil code is a horrible idea. why should we practice uniformity? who decides what is common? and why should my beliefs be beholden to what the state thinks?, 5:57, comment from ishwar, in india - secularism seems to a one-way traffic. everything appears to be loaded against the hindu community. no where in a country majority community is despised. this oppression is giving grounds for sangh parivar to grow in india just as jews worldwide., 5:57, vasundhara sirnate: i agree... since even our feminism comes from the mainlad they dont realise that in tribal communities women have a lot more power under customary law., 5:57, comment from madhan, its such a shame acts by hindu activists., 5:57, sudha ramalingam: by and large we are hippocratic, have no qualms to tell lies, what is needed is not new laws, but sensitization / change of minds and hearts with our head to accept alternatives, 5:57, comment from belovedbrother, @srinivas, uniform civil code (if implemented in purely secular way) is what we need, 5:57, comment from karthikeya pawar, when free speech is suppressed because it is deemed offensive or immoral by society, it is called tyranny of the majority., 5:58, comment from krishna, i think we are carried away by the propaganda of the west on india's tolerance. tolerance is in our dna. let us not fool ourselves. our country has evolved and matured only with debates not with swords.., 5:58, comment from keerthi kanth, @srinivas: govt has right to restrict...courts have final say on reasonableness of restriction, 5:58, comment from ravi, @belovedbrother: enducation doesn't mean a, b,c .... or a degree next to name. it mean understanding society, understanding the role of a person in it, understanding what civilization mean. etc. at the same time everyone should be given a platform to express themselves and get their problems addressed. ofcourse our law and order, politics aren't helping it., 5:58, comment from ishwar, @srinivas -if you want to live in a civilise society, there has to be some laws. if a muslim , christian or hindu or sikh can adopt uniform civil codes in us, why not in india?, 5:58, comment from neha, but who draws the line and where?, 5:59, vasundhara sirnate: tolerance is not in our dna.. we like to think that.. but we are a gravely intolerant society., 6:00, sudha ramalingam: laws cannot be panacea to evils. they are only one instrument in the hands of the state., 6:00, comment from keerthi kanth, @krishna: origin of propaganda is again debatable...but totally agreed with you on debates & tolerance issues, 6:00, comment from karthikeya pawar, when speech amounts to abuse, that's where the line is drawn., 6:00, vasundhara sirnate: see how well we tolerate a girl in a short skirt, see how well arnab tolerates opposing views on his show, see how renters dont give theur houses to single girls or muslims?, 6:00, comment from sam, @sudha ramalingam - hindu customs can be debated, but please don't claim it is being done because it ""concerns the majority"" ... the majority of the hindus just want to live their life peacefully without fundamentalists trying to define and restrict them using religion ..., 6:00, sudha ramalingam: sure we are intolerant as a society at the macro level we may be tolerant not at micro level, 6:00, vasundhara sirnate: see how well a mother in law tolerates a daughter in law who doesnt want to have children? see how well we tolerate the female foetus?, 6:00, comment from ravi, @vasundara, i don't thinks so. we did tolerate alot of foreign rulers for a long time. we are very patient people i think, 6:01, comment from neha, but one can argue the abuse could well be ignored, 6:01, comment from kk, there's nothing like absolute right of freedom. nothing 'absolute' ever existed, or exists., 6:01, comment from belovedbrother, why some one is allowed to carry knife? why someone is allowed cover face fully in public? why someone is allowed to marry more than once? why someone is allowed to divorce without proper court intervention? why property and inheritance laws are not uniform? why some animals are allowed to be slaughtered while some are not? all these will be fixed with a common secular civil code., 6:01, comment from sankar, we are indians and we are for free speech and freedom. the rationalist past of tamil leaders like periyar is our pride but what has tamilnadu come down to represet even when dravidian parties are ruling. sad!, 6:01, comment from krishna, right from our udanishads to adi shankara, debates on philosophy and religion have moulded this great country. so please don't teach tolerance and repair our image. these are all isolated incidents., 6:01, comment from aanju, the concept of tolerance and truth, two pillars of indian freedom struggle, is missing. gandhi used this to drive away british. now we are using everything, other than these two to show the dominance of one group over other.in reporting such events media should add sense rather than sensation., 6:01, vasundhara sirnate: that doesn't sound right. we didnt tolerate our invaders. we just didnt rise up against them all the time., 6:01, the hindu: thank you all for participating., 6:02, vasundhara sirnate: we were conquered. they didn't come in at our invitation. most kings were bought out by the empires, both mughal and british., 6:02, vasundhara sirnate: anyway, in closing lets all work towards trying to tolerate difference, 6:02, the hindu: many thanks to sruthisagar, sudha ramalingam and vasundhara sirnate., 6:02, sudha ramalingam: poor mother in laws are victims / tools in the hands of the males of the family... we have stereo typed the roles of mother in laws... it will only be the bride grooms' mother as mother in law who is seen to be powerful... not the mother of the bride who is also a mother in law, 6:03, vasundhara sirnate: i think everyone had a lot to say and i personally thank the engaged citizens for making us all think hard. keep it up guys., 6:03, sudha ramalingam: answer to all these ""why"" lies in the vote politics., 6:04, vasundhara sirnate: yes.. vote carefully next time.., 6:05, the hindu: many thanks to everyone who participated., 6:05, sudha ramalingam: let us try to do what voltaire said, defend to death the right to freedom of speech though we do not agree with what is being said., puliyur murugesan (45), an upcoming tamil writer, was assaulted after the release of his novel balachandran enra peyarum enakkundu. some members of the kongu vellalar community, claimed the novel demeaned their community.",0.06754917617626302,live chat : attack puthiya thalaimurai,"chennai : 12/03/2015 : city : two crude bombs hurled offcie tamil news channel puthiyathalaimurai ekkaduthangal early thursday . photo : k. pichumani &#124; photo credit : k_pichumani , latest attack tv channel puthiya thalaimurai serves yet another example growing intolerance efforts muzzle free speech tamil nadu. look live discussion freedom expression. , us , reporter sruthisagar yamunan , vasundhara sirnate , hindu centre politics public policy sudha ramalingam , advocate noted social activist. , 4 : 59 , comment guest , far government go curb free speech . era social network walk talk free speech rights , 4 : 59 , comment p.k.senthil kumaran , police intelligence weak crack mob bully media house weekly basis?

caste, nutrition and cultural issues are not his/her concern. another aspect that i find intriguing is how several activists involved in organic living tie their movement to hindu religious superiority. ‘shuddha vegetarian’ or ‘satvik’ food, ahimsa, yoga and ayurveda bundle themselves into an affirmation of hindu culture. all of a sudden, caste becomes a distorted social evil of british-raj origins while in its original fount — manu — it was the much-needed varna classification. this is something even the celebrated socio-cultural-religious-political activist mohandas karamchand gandhi battled with., some activists become hyper sensitive to comments from the west. i agree with some of the criticism of india’s daughter, but the fact remains that there was a lot in the movie that came as a powerful revelation. irrespective of who produced or directed it, it needed to be seen. and so there were those who did not support the ban but were unhappy with the ‘foreign’ criticism! culture and heritage activists have similar conflicts of being caught in a spider’s web of religion, class and history. in all this we see an inability to look beyond their limited need and condition.",0.08181163594470044,greater good,"self-appointed conscience keeper every society seems activist label denotes less self-absorbed far empathetic human ; person cause fight for. self-aggrandising motive ! activist lives others , listens oppressed , feels fragile. ‘for others ’ condition specialised specific commitments social justice , minority dalit rights , lgbt issues , environment , education , animal welfare , organic food , cultural activism . , activists inspiring people , many us , intimidating well. feel inadequate presence ; utter failures , fact. drawn society , consumed , lived , never seen real hardships nirbal , hardly ever dirtied hands. believe providing education son house help donating ‘x ’ amount social service. understand socio-political-environmental issues facing facebook , twitter headlines. feel moral ethical compromisers , activists , men women principles. also true activists body language patronising tone perpetuate air superiority. , let make clear greatest respect activism entails , various levels , curbing man ’ greed. find activism become self serving , narrow tunnel within activist trapped. trap exists un-deflatable ego blinds activist , making believe cause ‘end ’ . like antithesis , ceo multinational , times ignores side effects , say , collateral damage caused thought action. like fight resources among corporate tsars , battle resources takes place , establishing turfs turf-fights , also hierarchies. ironic within world activism also exist haves have-nots ! battle among activists financial , social cultural space become dirty , liberty becomes selective , jingoistic nationalism becomes essential tool. deep within crevasses activist ’ mind appear patriarchy , dogmatism ‘poof ’ goes idealism. fascinating aspect camouflaged behind basic fact activist working others. , recent hungama beef ban maharashtra , one set animal rights activists expressed great happiness decision. logic simple “i ’ care reasons behind ban socio-cultural implications. happy least cows spared ” . end met animal rights activist cost ?

2015-06-14,beef ban hits dharavi leather traders hard,"citing pollution fears and other factors, the successive governments shut downthe tanneries in dharavi. photo: vivek bendre , over the past three months, haji farookh, a third-generation leather trader has seen his business endure noticeable shifts. his godown, crammed with animal hide not too long ago, is almost vacant, while his labour force has shrunk from six to one., since the bjp-led government in maharashtra banned the slaughter of bulls and bullocks, there has been an acute shortage of raw material for the leather industry. the impact is the most severe in dharavi, one of the world’s largest slums, where mr. farookh operates. though past its prime, the slum still boasts a thriving leather industry of small-scale units., prior to the ban, dharavi would receive the hides of 450 bullocks and 50 buffaloes every day from the deonar slaughterhouse, the largest in asia. that figure has plunged to around 200, all heavy-duty buffalo hide, which has a limited and niche usage because of its hard and rough texture. bull skin, which boasts a finer grain, durability, sharper look and comfort, is preferred for making consumer leather products such has shoes, belts, jackets and handbags, dharavi’s mainstay. several small units have shut down over the weeks owing to the raw material shortage. hundreds of labourers have been rendered jobless. “the future is dark. we know nothing other than this trade. we lack the resources and the knowledge to start another business. what do we do now,” asks mr. farookh., citing pollution fears and other factors, the successive governments shut down the tanneries in dharavi. today, raw hides are salted in the slum and sent for processing to tanneries in kanpur, kolkata and chennai. the processed leather is sent back to dharavi for being made into attractive products, which are also exported., the influx of chinese imports, competing alternatives like rexine, cut-throat competition, rising costs, low margins and government apathy have left a once-thriving industry in the doldrums. with the beef ban and no alternative employment, those involved in the leather trade stare at a bleak future. “it was like an earthquake. it shook our core…there were no warnings,” said maqsood khan, a prominent trader. the raw material shortage has already pushed up the price of leather products made and sold in dharavi. as cheaper alternatives like rexine and attractive chinese products gain popularity, manufacturers expect the demand for leather to fall further., since maharashtra is a major supplier of top quality raw material, tanneries and manufacturing industries across india are feeling the pinch. they are forced to buy hides at increased rates and face a shortage of

‘foreigners’ — muslims, christians, dalits, tribals and the dissenting voices. it is ridiculous to see the state keeping a studied silence on the open call by organisations like the sanatan sanstha to

superiority or inferiority does not exist nor does that of any hierarchy. if generations have misinterpreted the term varna, it is for us to rectify it. if humans have erred in creating a hierarchy,

2015-10-09,t.m. krishna's open letter to prime minister,"honourable narendra modi-ji, as i penned this piece, i heard of your words at a rally in bihar, and instead of deterring me from writing to you, it only strengthened my resolve that this needs to be said., over the last week or more we have witnessed what can only be described as the molestation of a human tragedy, the perpetrators of this crime being politicians coloured green, saffron and various other shades, all no less sullied. as individuals, party-men, members of the ruling class and the opposition benches, they have vulgarised the very soul of compassion and empathy. this is for certain not a new phenomenon, and only another sign of who we are., however, with all due respect pradhan mantri-ji, what has astonished me is not just your silence, but the spoken and written words with which we citizens have been abused, ridiculed and trivialised for asking the elected leader of this country to respond. this is not a request from a political outfit, but from the people — just normal people belonging to the various parts, the sum of which is india. is this really such an unfair request? don't we have the right to ask, if not demand that you speak your mind? why are we being made to feel like offenders because we want you to say something direct and substantial on something that is for certain of socio-cultural importance? with all due respect, i have the right to not vote for you, yet to want from you, as prime minister, a response., you know what has been agitating the minds of millions of us, indians — the future of our pluralism. you have stated your position in terms of 'sabka sath, sabka vikas'. and this is quoted and cited on your behalf repeatedly as a mantra. but, pradhan mantriji, this is certainly not adequate. we need to hear you, our prime minister, directly and clearly and with an urgent reference to the present situation, which is nothing less than a tragedy. over the last few months we have had more than one tragedy. can we really not see the connections between the so-called stray incidences all over the country, from the murders of dabholkar, pansare and kalburgi to that of mohammad akhlaq. your direct voice needs to be heard now, unless you do not consider this an event of significance. and now, the ambiguity of what you said yesterday only makes me send you this appeal for your truthful intervention. this is not the time for platitudes, pradhan mantriji, but for a ringing condemnation from you, a kind of condemnation which will leave no one in doubt that the indian state is not going to tolerate anyone being killed for his views, his faith, his food., was the dadri tragedy not the result of the overt and aggressive imposition of a beef ban by certain state governments with leaders from numerous parties further exploiting the situation? sir, are you not disturbed – infuriated would be more appropriate — by the cost we are paying, and will continue to pay, for this mindlessness ? hearing hindu hardliners bring about counter-examples of hindus being targets of violent crimes, is tiresome. the fact that those are as condemnable and must be stopped cannot be used to make dadri a small or stray incident. and to accuse the media of over-playing this is downright despicable., today many in this country and elsewhere see you as an american presidential-style pm and you too seem to wear that notion with great style. that being so, you must respond like the american president does whenever there is any violence that is connected to race, ethnicity, religion or directly as a result of american laws and policy, irrespective of where it took place, who were the targets or the number of people affected. the citizens may not agree with him, but at least they hear his thoughts. from you we hear only generalities. the president of india is a symbol and his words guide us in spirit. you sir, the prime minister, is the ‘reality’ dealing with actual action, reaction, reconciliation, betterment and strength., you have said so many times that your government is one of difference and a conscious effort of your government has been to erase everything that you see as the evils of the congress past. then unlike them, speak, appeal, be forceful and clear those muddled minds. please don't play to the electoral gallery. you seem to be doing exactly that., and mr. prime minister, unlike your immediate predecessor you are not a mute spectator; you love to address and impress. we have heard you from lal qila, madison square garden, dubai and silicon valley, at the home of google and facebook. we have seen you being moved by the memory of the hardships faced by your mother. words, strong and emotional words come to you easily. so why do we need to shout and scream for a few sentences about a man who was lynched for allegedly consuming beef?, even after the lynching, your senior minister and members of your party are on record making the most inhuman statements. today the culture minister says you spoke to him. but modi-ji this is not a private matter between the two of you! this is a matter of and for indians and we need to hear you condemn your minister. you are fearless and free with your assault on opposition parties; can we please witness the same eloquence when it comes to your ministers and party members?, the rss and affiliates of the sangh parivar are constantly alienating people. modi-ji you are both the prime minister and the colossus that controls the bjp, therefore you are responsible for both establishments. not only them, but also for the vulgarities spouted by members of the sangh parivar. you are a self-proclaimed proud svayamsevak and it is clear that the parivar is indeed a family. therefore you cannot choose when to celebrate your sangh identity and when to distance yourself from it. this is double speak., your party spokesmen in their own inimitable style have been saying that it is your right to decide whether to speak, where to do so and in what form. they are absolutely correct, but if you don’t feel you need to say something that will shut all these extreme actions that drain the happiness out of people, even a non-believer will seek divine intervention., this is not about secularism; this is about us being a humane, real and sensitive, a non-accusatory nation. you use social media widely, something you happily flaunted in the presence of mark zuckerberg and hence i am certain you have seen all the vitriolic comments that are swarming indian cyberspace. don’t you think you need to confront it directly?, finally sir, you have said that hindus and muslims must decide what they want to fight, each other or poverty. to me this is nothing but another empty slogan because poverty is inextricably connected to religion, caste and class. unless we face up to these challenges with greater honesty and courage, not just our poverty but our backwardness will remain indeed incurable.",0.0923274094326726,t.m. krishna ' open letter prime minister,"honourable narendra modi-ji , penned piece , heard words rally bihar , instead deterring writing , strengthened resolve needs said. , last week witnessed described molestation human tragedy , perpetrators crime politicians coloured green , saffron various shades , less sullied. individuals , party-men , members ruling class opposition benches , vulgarised soul compassion empathy. certain new phenomenon , another sign are. , however , due respect pradhan mantri-ji , astonished silence , spoken written words citizens abused , ridiculed trivialised asking elected leader country respond. request political outfit , people — normal people belonging various parts , sum india. really unfair request ?

2015-10-09,"beefed-up curbs, feeble resistance","invariably, there are times in a constitution’s life when its very fundamentals are under threat, times when the technicality of laws made under the powers of that constitution are the very weapons used to undermine its foundations. rarely do foundational threats to constitutions come as sudden events, they often build up as liberties and freedoms are incrementally compromised. we are now perilously close to a moment where this is true of the constitution of india as well., from the perspective of the rule of law enshrined in the constitution, it would be naïve to think that >dadri happened overnight. it is important to confront the tame manner in which rights are protected in this country and the ease with which the state can trample upon liberties and freedoms. worse, dadri is also a stark reminder of the extent to which we have surrendered our rights to the state. at the heart of >mohammad akhlaq’s lynching is a group that has violently asserted a claim not to be offended, a legal regime that, through anti-cow slaughter laws, has given legitimacy to this claim, and a society that has allowed the state to chip away at the liberty of its people over the decades., ‘being offended’ has emerged as an extremely effective ground for curtailing liberties and freedoms. not only does ‘being offended’ serve as a political, religious and cultural tool, it has also crept into constitutional adjudication. groups that represent various political, cultural, and religious interests routinely invoke this idea of ‘being offended’ to infringe upon other’s rights by resorting to the cliché that rights are not absolute., offence not a valid defence for curbsof course, rights are not absolute but people are mistaken to assert that ‘offending the sentiments’ is a sufficient justification for curbing constitutionally guaranteed freedoms. often, this claim of being offended is backed with threats of violence if the offending material is not withdrawn; we have seen enough of these threats being carried out. unfortunately, our governments have been more than content to give in to these kinds of threats and often sacrifice the freedoms involved., irrespective of whether or not violence is used as a threat, normalising this idea of ‘offence’ as the basis for protesting against the exercise of rights is dangerous for a democratic society. be it protesting against mira nair’s fire; taslima nasrin’s lajja; or the latest round of objections to the play >agnes of god — invoking this idea of ‘being offended’ as the basis to restrict rights cannot be considered legitimate for some and illegitimate for others. the more we invoke this idea of ‘offence’ and maintain our silence when it is invoked, the more we legitimise it. the result of legitimising this idea of ‘offence’ is that sections of society come to believe that they have a ‘right not to be offended’. and when this imagined right is seen as being infringed upon by some members of the society, there is an increasing tendency to enforce it through violence. our disappointing reactions to the cold-blooded murders of rationalists like >narendra dabholkar, >govind pansare and >m.m. kalburgi are tragic examples of the extent to which we have come to accept this ‘right not to be offended’., you only need to watch some of the television channels that beam content into our homes to understand the extent to which we have internalised this right ‘not to get offended’. as the consumers of content on these channels, we are happy for them to self-censor and remove words like sex, beef, shit, vagina and lesbian/gay. perhaps more worryingly, we seem to be increasingly comfortable with giving our rights away to the state without even demanding the most basic protections in return. the >widespread support for aadhaar is a classic example of this. and so is our tacit complicity with the extensive surveillance regime that has been put in place over the years with hardly any safeguards., in these contexts, we eagerly accept the state’s narrative — that these restrictions are for our protection — without really reflecting on the manner in which we are making ourselves extremely vulnerable to state interference into our most private spheres. we seem to be unconcerned that through the aadhaar scheme and its linking to a vast array of services, we are handing over a whole lot of information about our lives to the state — information it can access and use without any checks, information it has no rights to access., unfortunately, prioritising the ‘right not to be offended’ has influenced constitutional adjudication as well. the supreme court’s stamp of approval in march 2008 on >banning the sale of meat in ahmedabad during the jain festival of paryushan is a perfect example. the basis for restricting the rights of butchers in that case was “respecting the sentiments of a particular section of society”. that consideration has no constitutional basis and today we find ourselves burdened with this decision that governments are happy to exploit., another example is the supreme court’s approval in march 2004 for an all-year ban on sale of fish, meat and eggs in rishikesh, like the ones that had existed in haridwar and muni ki reti for many years. the supreme court invoked the dietary preferences of pilgrims visiting these towns as sufficient justification for such a ban. the supreme court’s freedom of speech jurisprudence is replete with such attempts aimed at preventing offence to the sentiments of others. the latest instance of this was justice dipak misra’s judgment in the supreme court that artists cannot use abusive words, particularly against mahatma gandhi, in the name of artistic freedom., the attack on our freedoms and liberties has also been facilitated through our deafening silences when the foundational civil liberties have been under attack. india’s legacy in its efforts to combat extremist violence of all sorts is characterised by torture, impunity and a persistent state of exception to the rule of law. through draconian instruments like the armed forces special powers act (afspa); the terrorist and disruptive activities (prevention) act (tada); the prevention of terrorism act (pota); the unlawful activities prevention act (uapa) and organised crime legislations that have all disappointingly found the approval of the supreme court, the state has managed to play on our fears and convince us that the only way to achieve security is by sacrificing the rights of some. large-scale violence with the complicity of the state machinery — be it in nellie, delhi, bhagalpur or gujarat — has seen far too little legal and political accountability. as a society and a legal system, we have often sent out the message that the most inhumane and cruel forms of violence will be forgiven and forgotten., imprimatur of law and courtsthe story of the >banning of cow slaughter and the restrictions on the consumption of beef follow a very similar trajectory. different states have different provisions on cow slaughter in terms of the kind of cattle that can be slaughtered (if at all) and when they can be slaughtered in terms of their utility in agriculture. while state legislation in the 1950s imposed a complete ban on slaughter of cows and a partial ban on slaughter of bulls, the scope of the ban has increased over the decades. relatively recent pieces of legislation like those in gujarat (amended in 1994), madhya pradesh (2011), and maharashtra (2015) contain a complete prohibition on the slaughter of cows, bulls and bullocks.",0.0662535014005602,"beefed-up curbs , feeble resistance","invariably , times constitution ’ life fundamentals threat , times technicality laws made powers constitution weapons used undermine foundations. rarely foundational threats constitutions come sudden events , often build liberties freedoms incrementally compromised. perilously close moment true constitution india well. , perspective rule law enshrined constitution , would naïve think >dadri happened overnight. important confront tame manner rights protected country ease state trample upon liberties freedoms. worse , dadri also stark reminder extent surrendered rights state. heart >mohammad akhlaq ’ lynching group violently asserted claim offended , legal regime , anti-cow slaughter laws , given legitimacy claim , society allowed state chip away liberty people decades. , ‘being offended ’ emerged extremely effective ground curtailing liberties freedoms. ‘being offended ’ serve political , religious cultural tool , also crept constitutional adjudication. groups represent various political , cultural , religious interests routinely invoke idea ‘being offended ’ infringe upon ’ rights resorting cliché rights absolute. , offence valid defence curbsof course , rights absolute people mistaken assert ‘offending sentiments ’ sufficient justification curbing constitutionally guaranteed freedoms. often , claim offended backed threats violence offending material withdrawn ;

2015-10-23,to eat or not to eat,"jacket of d.n. jha's book. | photo credit: 24dmc writeangle , the ever-popular facebook can be so useful! the other day in the middle of a heated debate on the beef ban, a gentleman pointed out that the bharatiya janata party, which was all in favour of beef ban in maharashtra and north india including jammu and kashmir as also bihar, had no problem with eating of beef in kerala as it was considered part of a local dietary tradition., not too sure of the authenticity of the claim, i decided to walk down history lane to find out. it brought with it ample rewards, nostalgia seeped knowledge; and a search for renowned historian d.n. jha’s books all over again. in college, we had read his works on ancient india with varying degrees of curiosity and amusement. until one day, a lecturer dropped a bombshell, “cow was not sacred in ancient india,” she said. brought up on notions of the cow’s sacredness in these parts of the country, we contested her claims. it was a no-win situation for us, as she calmly advised us to read d.n. jha!, that was the age when internet was not exactly round the corner and most reputed books had run out of stock when it came to jha’s books – he was more widely read than i initially imagined in my ignorance-filled days. if at that time i could not lay my hands on “the myth of the holy cow”, this time i was luckier. and what an eye-opener it proved! we had been told during our graduation days in delhi university that cattle were sacrificed in huge numbers during the vedic age. there were rituals which could not be completed without the sacrifice of cattle, horse and the like. but what jha writes in “the myth of the holy cow” gives me a delicious reason to stick to non-vegetarian diet – no disrespect intended for lovers of arhar dal. not just human beings even deities ate meat. and in 2015 people are slaughtered on mere suspicion of storing beef!, writes jha in his book, “animal sacrifices were very common, the most important of them being the famous asvamedha and rajasuya. these and several other major sacrifices involved the killing of animals, including cattle, which constituted the chief form of the wealth of the early aryans. not surprisingly, they prayed for cattle and sacrificed them to propitiate their gods. the vedic gods had no marked dietary preferences. milk, butter, barley, oxen, goats and sheep were their usual food, though some of them seem to have had their special preferences. indra had a special liking for bulls. agni was not a tippler like indra, but was fond of the flesh of horses, bulls and cows. the toothless pusan, the guardian of the roads, ate mush as a hobson’s choice. soma was the name of an intoxicant but, equally important, of a god, and killing animals (including cattle) for him was basic to most of the rgvedic yajnas. the maruts and the asvins were also offered cows. the vedas mention about 250 animals out of which at least 50 were deemed fit for sacrifice, by implication for divine as well as human consumption. the taittiriya brahmana categorically tells us, ‘verily the cow is food’ (atho annam vai gauh) and yajnavalkya’s insistence on eating the tender (amsala) flesh of the cow is well known.”, he does not stop here. to make it easier for an average student of history, and the happily oblivious common man, he cites examples from the mahabharata and ramayana to drive home the point – life was incomplete without a non-vegetarian meal for deities and dasas alike. he reminds that “the mahabharata also makes a laudatory reference to the king rantideva in whose kitchen two thousand cows were butchered each day, their flesh, along with grain, being distributed among the brahmanas.”, similarly, he takes recourse to valmiki’s ramayana to tell us of the dietary tradition of the gods and goddesses. “rama was born after his father dasarath performed a big sacrifice involving the slaughter of a large number of animals declared edible by the dharmasastras. sita, assures the yamuna, while crossing it that she would worship the river with a thousand cows and a hundred jars of wine when rama accomplishes his vow. her fondness for deer meat drives her husband crazy enough to kill maricha, a deer in disguise. bharadvaja welcomes rama by slaughtering a fatted calf in his honour,” jha writes in the conclusion of the book where he also clearly tells us that whether it was the age of the mauryan empire, including the period of asoka or the gupta age, animal sacrifice as also eating of their flesh was very much prevalent. for instance, ceremonial welcome of guests was considered complete only with honey, curd and flesh of cow or bull., even the “sacred thread ceremony for its part was not all that sacred; for it was necessary for a snataka to wear an upper garment of cowhide” and the deadtoo were sent away with animals. “the thick fat of the cow was used to cover the corpse and a bull was burnt along with it to enable the departed to ride in the nether world,” the illustrious historian writes.",0.0788419312169312,eat eat,"jacket d.n. jha ' book. &#124; photo credit : 24dmc writeangle , ever-popular facebook useful !

2015-11-12,ode to the happy country,"in october 1959, when jawaharlal nehru had gone to nagarjunasagar to inaugurate a dam, a worker is said to have come up to him and said in telugu: “here you have lighted a lamp.’’ nehru was so moved that he adopted this as the test of a person’s work and wrote, “do we, in the course of our lives, light lamps, or do we snuff out the lamps or candles that exist?” there are many versions of this episode. i have chosen to use the one by the historian rudrangshu mukherjee. but whichever version you may use, you will agree that this is an intuitive compass by which to conduct ourselves. as we snuff out lamps, we fill our world with darkness., we may want to reflect seriously on whether rising and unchecked >intolerance in india today is snuffing out the lamps across our own country. >more than a month ago, at dadri, not far from delhi, a man was lynched by his neighbours for allegedly storing beef in his home. earlier, rationalists and historians who had dared to express scepticism of certain ideologies had been murdered. over the past few years, violence against dalits, writers and academics has taken place with nary a response from elected governments., protecting the rights of the minoritieshowever, the >statements of prime minister modi after dadri are worse than none at all. he is reported to have said that hindus and muslims must fight poverty and not each other. this is disingenuous, for at dadri an innocent muslim had been killed by a mob of hindus. there is no numerical parity between the hindus and the muslims, or between the hindus and people belonging to any other minority community in india. so, the onus is on the hindu population of india to make the minorities feel secure in this country. as for the government of india, to fail to protect the life and liberty of its minorities amounts to a craven abdication of a mandate to govern., into the mix has been thrown the >observation by moody’s analytics, that india’s growth prospects are threatened by social conflict. there is also the trope that calls for peace on grounds that we are being watched by potential overseas investors. this is odd, as we need to maintain social harmony for its own sake, to save our way of life. and, in any case, while a growing economy is absolutely essential to improve our living conditions, a cohesive society may be even more important., a unique understanding of the value of social cohesion is contained in an observation made by the grand old man of indian industry. j.r.d. tata’s biographer r.m. lala quotes him as saying: “an american economist has predicted that in the next century india will be an economic superpower. i do not want india to be an economic superpower. i want india to be a happy country.” these words resonate today when abdication of governance means that we could end up living in an unhappy country with a dynamic economy., the point is that one cannot enjoy one’s hard-earned wealth or social standing if some members of the society one is part of remain unhappy. if >violence against minorities of every hue were to continue, we would have a significant section of india alienated from the mainstream. the economy, which is a network of material relations, can always be revived, but the society, which is a network of human relations based on trust, may not be repaired so easily once damaged., while events of the past year or so can leave us without the slightest doubt that the sections who feel most threatened in india today are our muslim and christian compatriots, historically, there have been other groups that have long felt marginalised., different minorities, diverse rightswhile communal fascism threatening india’s religious minorities has received the attention of its intelligentsia, the devastating influence of patriarchy has not done so. >outrage in the ‘nirbhaya’ case has not led to a focussed attention on the subjugation of women in indian society even outside of the discrimination embedded in personal laws. moreover, personal law itself has been exclusively interpreted as pertaining only to marriage., sexual freedom is never addressed, thus perpetrating an incredible rights discourse cleansed of the non-heteronormative ‘other’. majoritarianism is enshrined in section 377 of the indian penal code which disenfranchises india’s gay/lesbian people. originally legislated by a colonial power guided by judaeo-christian values, it has recently been upheld by the supreme court petitioned by a coalition representing all the indigenous religions of the country. sadly, religious reaction won the day, signifying that some indians demand freedoms for themselves but are unwilling to extend them to others., mainstreaming the marginalisedindia’s political class, happy to resort to ordinances in the normal course, has revealed its pusillanimity by not jettisoning the section. it is clear that, as pronounced on another occasion by some judges of the

2015-11-13,standing to reason and reason alone,"soon after the ongoing controversy over the >ban on the consumption of beef erupted, we had the ironical situation of its proponents seeking legitimacy by pointing to the indian constitution and its opponents seeking credibility through arguments from religious and social traditions., the framers of the constitution recommended that the future governments of the indian republic strive to prevent cow slaughter, largely because the issue was too politically charged for them to settle in the late 1940s. if the creation of a enlightened constitution upholding liberty and equality was a remarkable achievement for the times, the insertion of the clause — involving hypocrisy and subterfuge, as frank anthony put on record in the constituent assembly — on cow slaughter was not its finest momoment. on this issue, they effectively passed the buck., as long as it is in our constitution — and it will probably be there for a long time, given the basic structure doctrine — every generation of indian citizens will have to deal with the question of cows and their slaughter. to be sure, nothing in the constitution penalises the >possession or consumption of beef, as lynch mobs and politicians would have you believe. yet those who seek to prevent the slaughter of cows have no less an authority than the constitution of india on their side., then as now, arguments purporting to protect the cattle wealth are sophistry. the only reason there is a directive principle concerning cow slaughter is the consideration for hindu sensibilities., invoking traditiontherefore, perhaps, the opponents of “beef ban” have energetically offered hindu religious tradition and practice to demonstrate that the slaughter of cows prevailed during vedic times and that consumption of beef was not uncommon even among brahmins. the great upanishadic sage yajnavalkya is reported to have consumed beef only if were tender. both the ramayana and mahabharata mention the consumption of beef. charaka, sushruta and vagbhata, known for their treatises on medicine, refer to the therapeutic uses of beef., k. t. achaya, a delightful scholar of indian food, writes that “beef was freely eaten: there are four names for this meat in the early tamil language, showing that it was a common and well-liked food. he also notes that by the time of al-biruni’s visits to india in the 11th century ce, social attitudes had turned against the eating of beef. even so, many communities in different parts of india continue to eat beef — not all hindus share the same sensibilities. there is no hard and fast rule against beef within the parameters of the broad hindu faith., however, whether or not the ancient hindus ate beef is beside the point. the question of whether the indian republic ought to be concerned with cow slaughter is not a sectarian one. it should be answered from the ground of reason. for our constitution is not grounded on theology or tradition but firmly in the enlightenment values of reason, individualism and liberty. there was no precedent for equality of citizens, fundamental rights and universal franchise in indian tradition, until the constitution came along in 1950. the indian state is a republic of reason, not an altar at which the tenets of the many faiths and spiritual paths of the indian nation are worshipped., democratic imperativeso the arguments for and against the beef ban must be based on reason. if democracy is not to become an instrument to impose majoritarian mores on the entire population, the only way is to use reason for public persuasion., of course, it is hard to single out the cow for special protection on any rational ground, but there is a case for vegetarianism michael pollan, who considers some of the ethical dimensions of our diet in the omnivore’s dilemma: a natural history of four meals, contends that “were the walls of our meat industry to become transparent, literally or even figuratively, we would not long continue to raise, kill, and eat animals the way we do.” it is possible to persuade people of the merits of vegetarianism without recourse to sanctimony., similarly, the case against the beef ban ought to rely on science, public health, nutrition and economics. there is enough evidence that beef is a relatively inexpensive way for the poor to have access to dietary protein, and thus is useful in tackling the >widespread malnutrition in our country., now many prominent participants in the beef controversy are engaged in it solely to reap dividends of the politics of bigotry. yet the issue of cow slaughter and beef consumption is an unsettled question of public policy that we, for the reason that it is in our constitution, must find ways of setting to rest. the more we use public reasoning to argue the matter, the less space we give to divisive politics by cow., it is popularly argued that solutions can be found within the religious framework — all we need to do is empower the moderates and they will persuade the extremists. in societies where the effects of the european enlightenment have been indirect or peripheral, this seldom happens. for instance, in countries where islam is dominant, it is unlikely that moderate muslims will be able to prevail over their less moderate counterparts., liberal fallacyas sam harris (founder of project reason) puts it, “ while moderation in religion may seem a reasonable position to stake out...it offers no bulwark against >religious extremism and religious violence. the problem that religious moderation poses for all of us is that it does not permit anything very critical to be said about religious literalism. we cannot say that fundamentalists are crazy, because they are merely practicing their freedom of belief; we cannot even say that they are mistaken in religious terms, because their knowledge of scripture is generally unrivalled. all we can say, as religious moderates, is that we don’t like the personal and social costs that a full embrace of scripture imposes on us. this is not a new form of faith, or even a new species of scriptural exegesis; it is simply a capitulation...”, we must not, therefore, play the game according to the rules and out-of-bounds markers set by a religion, or indeed, by all of them., while our modern constitution enjoins us to do so, the use of reason and critical inquiry in public policy is not something that started in 1950. the >arthashastra is a strong advocate of the use of reason in politics, holding that the “study of critical inquiry is always thought of as a lamp for all branches of knowledge, a means in all activities, and a support for all religious and social duty”., it is unambiguous in placing reason and critical inquiry above other considerations: “investigating by means of reasons, good and evil in the vedic religion, profit and loss in the field of trade and agriculture, and prudent and imprudent policy in political administration, as well as their relative strengths and weaknesses, the study of critical inquiry (anvikshiki) confers benefit on people, keeps their minds steady in adversity and in prosperity, and produces adeptness of understanding, speech and action.” (arthashastra, 1.2.11)., this tradition of reason in our politics is too precious to be allowed to fall victim to dogmatic assertions of the primacy of tradition, theology or indeed clauses in the constitution., narendra modi, first as candidate and then as prime minister has stated that the constitution is the government’s only holy book. in doing so, he was trying to reassure the world that his government will not engage in discrimination on the basis of religion, caste or creed.",0.05651237142062829,standing reason reason alone,"soon ongoing controversy >ban consumption beef erupted , ironical situation proponents seeking legitimacy pointing indian constitution

governments of the indian republic strive to prevent cow slaughter, largely because the issue was too politically charged for them to settle in the late 1940s. if the creation of a enlightened constitution upholding liberty and equality was a remarkable achievement for the times, the insertion of the clause — involving hypocrisy and subterfuge, as frank anthony put on record in the constituent assembly — on cow slaughter was not its finest momoment. on this issue, they effectively passed the buck., as long as it is in our constitution — and it will probably be there for a long time, given the basic structure doctrine — every generation of indian citizens will have to deal with the question of cows and their slaughter. to be sure, nothing in the constitution penalises the >possession or consumption of beef, as lynch mobs and politicians would have you believe. yet those who seek to prevent the slaughter of cows have no less an authority than the constitution of india on their side., then as now, arguments purporting to protect the cattle wealth are sophistry. the only reason there is a directive principle concerning cow slaughter is the consideration for hindu sensibilities., invoking traditiontherefore, perhaps, the opponents of “beef ban” have energetically offered hindu religious tradition and practice to demonstrate that the slaughter of cows prevailed during vedic times and that consumption of beef was not uncommon even among brahmins. the great upanishadic sage yajnavalkya is reported to have consumed beef only if were tender. both the ramayana and mahabharata mention the consumption of beef. charaka, sushruta and vagbhata, known for their treatises on medicine, refer to the therapeutic uses of beef., k. t. achaya, a delightful scholar of indian food, writes that “beef was freely eaten: there are four names for this meat in the early tamil language, showing that it was a common and well-liked food. he also notes that by the time of al-biruni’s visits to india in the 11th century ce, social attitudes had turned against the eating of beef. even so, many communities in different parts of india continue to eat beef — not all hindus share the same sensibilities. there is no hard and fast rule against beef within the parameters of the broad hindu faith., however, whether or not the ancient hindus ate beef is beside the point. the question of whether the indian republic ought to be concerned with cow slaughter is not a sectarian one. it should be answered from the ground of reason. for our constitution is not grounded on theology or tradition but firmly in the enlightenment values of reason, individualism and liberty. there was no precedent for equality of citizens, fundamental rights and universal franchise in indian tradition, until the constitution came along in 1950. the indian state is a republic of reason, not an altar at which the tenets of the many faiths and spiritual paths of the indian nation are worshipped., democratic imperativeso the arguments for and against the beef ban must be based on reason. if democracy is not to become an instrument to impose majoritarian mores on the entire population, the only way is to use reason for public persuasion., of course, it is hard to single out the cow for special protection on any rational ground, but there is a case for vegetarianism michael pollan, who considers some of the ethical dimensions of our diet in the omnivore’s dilemma: a natural history of four meals, contends that “were the walls of our meat industry to become transparent, literally or even figuratively, we would not long continue to raise, kill, and eat animals the way we do.” it is possible to persuade people of the merits of vegetarianism without recourse to sanctimony., similarly, the case against the beef ban ought to rely on science, public health, nutrition and economics. there is enough evidence that beef is a relatively inexpensive way for the poor to have access to dietary protein, and thus is useful in tackling the >widespread malnutrition in our country., now many prominent participants in the beef controversy are engaged in it solely to reap dividends of the politics of bigotry. yet the issue of cow slaughter and beef consumption is an unsettled question of public policy that we, for the reason that it is in our constitution, must find ways of setting to rest. the more we use public reasoning to argue the matter, the less space we give to divisive politics by cow., it is popularly argued that solutions can be found within the religious framework — all we need to do is empower the moderates and they will persuade the extremists. in societies where the effects of the european enlightenment have been indirect or peripheral, this seldom happens. for instance, in countries where islam is dominant, it is unlikely that moderate muslims will be able to prevail over their less moderate counterparts., liberal fallacyas sam harris (founder of project reason) puts it, “ while moderation in religion may seem a reasonable position to stake out...it offers no bulwark against >religious extremism and religious violence. the problem that religious moderation poses for all of us is that it does not permit anything very critical to be said about religious literalism. we cannot say that fundamentalists are crazy, because they are merely practicing their freedom of belief; we cannot even say that they are mistaken in religious terms, because their knowledge of scripture is generally unrivalled. all we can say, as religious moderates, is that we don’t like the personal and social costs that a full embrace of scripture imposes on us. this is not a new form of faith, or even a new species of scriptural exegesis; it is simply a capitulation...”, we must not, therefore, play the game according to the rules and out-of-bounds markers set by a religion, or indeed, by all of them., while our modern constitution enjoins us to do so, the use of reason and critical inquiry in public policy is not something that started in 1950. the >arthashastra is a strong advocate of the use of reason in politics, holding that the “study of critical inquiry is always thought of as a lamp for all branches of knowledge, a means in all activities, and a support for all religious and social duty”., it is unambiguous in placing reason and critical inquiry above other considerations: “investigating by means of reasons, good and evil in the vedic religion, profit and loss in the field of trade and agriculture, and prudent and imprudent policy in political administration, as well as their relative strengths and weaknesses, the study of critical inquiry (anvikshiki) confers benefit on people, keeps their minds steady in adversity and in prosperity, and produces adeptness of understanding, speech and action.” (arthashastra, 1.2.11)., this tradition of reason in our politics is too precious to be allowed to fall victim to dogmatic assertions of the primacy of tradition, theology or indeed clauses in the constitution., narendra modi, first as candidate and then as prime minister has stated that the constitution is the government’s only holy book. in doing so, he was trying to reassure the world that his government will not engage in discrimination on the basis of religion, caste or creed.",0.05651237142062829,standing reason reason alone,"soon ongoing controversy >ban consumption beef erupted , ironical situation proponents seeking legitimacy pointing indian constitution

2015-11-17,"selfie militancy, a developing crisis","prime minister narendra modi (r) with jammu and kashmir chief minister mufti mohammad sayeed and peoples democratic party leader mehbooba mufti at a rally in srinagar. photo: nissar ahmad | photo credit: nissar ahmad , while political parties and the media debate the remarkable election upset in bihar, and rightly hope that it will lead to a course corrective in election campaigning, little attention has been paid to another event that took place the day before the results were announced: >prime minister narendra modi’s visit to jammu and kashmir on november 7., the visit was the first since the bharatiya janata party-peoples democratic party (bjp-pdp) coalition >took power in jammu and kashmir, in early 2015, and had been hyped both in srinagar and in delhi as one in which important political announcements would be made, even perhaps a reassurance to the muslim minority in india and an offer of peace talks with pakistan. the prime minister, it was hinted, would renew the initiatives taken by mr. atal bihari vajpayee when he was prime minister over 10 years ago., implications of packagein the event, however, what was announced was central government aid of rs.80,000 crore, part of it to help the state recover from the economic losses caused by the floods and some of it to expand connectivity. over 40 per cent of the grant will go towards four-laning the udhampur-ramban and ramban-banihal sections of national highway 44, which should certainly help boost the economy though it remains to be seen whether it will also help prevent blockades of the highway. whether the remainder will prove effective in helping the state recover depends a large extent on how it is allocated and whether implementation will be honest and transparent., the announcement of the aid has not only been a damp squib, but also seems to have underlined the absence of a strong political message. mr. modi did make a reference to mr. vajpayee’s initiative and pledged to build on his slogan of “kashmiriyat, jamhooriyat, insaniyat”, saying that india was incomplete without the sufi tradition of kashmiriyat. he also talked of the pain of the kashmiri youth and the scourge of unemployment, saying that new delhi’s treasury and heart were alike open to kashmir. in a surprising reference to former prime minister manmohan singh’s speech at jammu university, he further spoke about building a “new kashmir”, which was sheikh abdullah’s slogan 50 years ago., impact of strifegiven the heated political situation in the state, however, his words were taken as an attempt to revive outworn symbols rather than the preamble to concrete political initiatives. >communal tensions have been high in jammu and kashmir ever since a truck driver was killed in udhampur in october over the suspicion that he was smuggling beef. mla rashid, himself impetuous, >was beaten up in the state assembly by bjp mlas, again in october, because he hosted a “beef party” in response to the high court’s upholding of the beef ban in jammu and kashmir. subsequently, he had >his face blackened in delhi over the same issue. reports of a demonstration by hindu radicals with swords in jammu have further exacerbated the rising communal divide between jammu and the valley., an expression of regret over these events would have been helpful but mr. modi made no reference to them. nor did he seek to give reassurances on other contentious issues that arose after his government took power, such as a rollback of article 370, or whether his party remains committed to implement the common minimum programme on which the bjp and pdp had based their alliance., protests broke out in the aftermath of the prime minister’s visit and have continued. a young man was killed by an unexploded tear gas shell soon after mr. modi had left the state — a similar incident was the trigger for the youth revolt of 2010. over the past few months there has been a revival of militancy in the valley, with innumerable commentators pointing out that “the new militancy” not only glorifies youth with guns, but also that the youth who are now joining up do not conceal their identities but rather flaunt them on social media., the use of social mediawhat is the meaning of this selfie militancy? is it that these young men prefer to wage their battles through social media rather than armed conflict, in which the gun is a decorative prop rather than a weapon of war? or is it that militant youth do not fear the security forces because they know they will be sheltered and protected by the local population? either way, the message is alarming. even if today’s selfie militancy is largely about propaganda rather than armed conflict, we can be sure that some of the young men they recruit will mount attacks on security forces leading to retaliation and further alienation., if, on the other hand, the new militants flaunt their faces because they know they will be protected by the local population, then we are in for a hard and protracted time. from 2008 to 2010, jammu and kashmir enjoyed relative peace because the people of the state were tired of armed conflict and no longer willing to protect and shelter militants. after the violence of the summer of 2010, when anger at the security forces, including or especially the police, was at its height, local populations remained opposed to a renewal of militancy. if today that resistance has faded, then the state and central governments need to take urgent and remedial measures., the way forward",0.06620436777153194,"selfie militancy , developing crisis","prime minister narendra modi ( r ) jammu kashmir chief minister mufti mohammad sayeed peoples democratic party leader mehbooba mufti rally srinagar. photo : nissar ahmad &#124; photo credit : nissar ahmad , political parties media debate remarkable election upset bihar , rightly hope lead course corrective election campaigning , little attention paid another event took place day results announced : >prime minister narendra modi ’ visit jammu kashmir november 7. , visit first since bharatiya janata party-peoples democratic party ( bjp-pdp ) coalition >took power jammu kashmir , early 2015 , hyped srinagar delhi one important political announcements would made , even perhaps reassurance muslim minority india offer peace talks pakistan. prime minister , hinted , would renew initiatives taken mr. atal bihari vajpayee prime minister 10 years ago. , implications packagein event , however , announced central government aid rs.80,000 crore , part help state recover economic losses caused floods expand connectivity. 40 per cent grant go towards four-laning udhampur-ramban ramban-banihal sections national highway 44 , certainly help boost economy though remains seen whether also help prevent blockades highway. whether remainder prove effective helping state recover depends large extent allocated whether implementation honest transparent. , announcement aid damp squib , also seems underlined absence strong political message. mr. modi make reference mr. vajpayee ’ initiative pledged build slogan “kashmiriyat , jamhooriyat , insaniyat ” , saying india incomplete without sufi tradition kashmiriyat. also talked pain kashmiri youth scourge unemployment , saying new delhi ’ treasury heart alike open kashmir. surprising reference former prime minister manmohan singh ’ speech jammu university , spoke building “new kashmir ” , sheikh abdullah ’ slogan 50 years ago. , impact strifegiven heated political situation state , however , words taken attempt revive outworn symbols rather preamble concrete political initiatives. >communal tensions high jammu kashmir ever since truck driver killed udhampur october suspicion smuggling beef. mla rashid , impetuous , >was beaten state assembly bjp mlas , october , hosted “beef party ” response high court ’ upholding beef ban jammu kashmir. subsequently , >his face blackened delhi issue. reports demonstration hindu radicals swords jammu exacerbated rising communal divide jammu valley. , expression regret events would helpful mr. modi made reference them. seek give reassurances contentious issues arose government took power , rollback article 370 , whether party remains committed implement common minimum programme bjp pdp based alliance. , protests broke aftermath prime minister ’ visit continued. young man killed unexploded tear gas shell soon mr. modi left state — similar incident trigger youth revolt 2010. past months revival militancy valley , innumerable commentators pointing “the new militancy ” glorifies youth guns , also youth joining conceal identities rather flaunt social media. , use social mediawhat meaning selfie militancy ?

2015-12-07,secular in spirit and in letter,"on november 26, constitution day, union home minister rajnath singh bemoaned in parliament that secularism was the >“most misused” term in the country. “the framers of the constitution did not include the words ‘secular’ and ‘socialist’ because these values were (already) part of indian civilisation,” said mr. singh. he was essentially voicing a belief that secularism was alien to the constitution, and that it was only during the emergency that secularism stealthily crept into the constitution. that belief, though popular, is not quite right., the framers of the constitution worked against the backdrop of two great instances of human carnage — world war ii and the partition of india. both were the result of an insistence on distinctiveness of group identities and their consequent territorial demarcations, which excluded those who did not fall within the dominant group. simultaneously, the process of integration of princely states meant that people not exposed to even limited democracy became voters of a republic that promised justice, liberty, equality and fraternity for all., the state of the country, as justice aftab alam reminded us in his gandhi foundation annual lecture in 2009, was that it was “home to eight major religions of the world. the constitution of india recognises 22 languages as indian/national languages. indians speaking the same language may belong to different religions. conversely, indians belonging to the same religious group may come from different ethnic stocks, may speak different languages, dress differently, eat different kinds of food in entirely different manners and may have completely different social and economic concerns”., in a nascent republic, where power had for the first time been vested in the diverse, heterogenous people of the subcontinent, the constituent assembly became a trustee and demarcator of the extent of that power. the document that they produced after two years of intense debate and labour had words of comfort for everyone., read: >secularism and the constitution, a constitutional valuesecularism is implicit in the entire constitutional framework. what does secularism in the indian constitution mean? the question admits of no easy answer and cannot be restricted to textual interpretation alone. it is a constitutional value that seeks to manage india’s diverse and plural society, in an atmosphere of cohesiveness of national purpose., the guarantee of equality in article 14; the promise of non-discrimination in articles 15 and 16; protection from religious taxes and religious instruction in state-funded institutions set in articles 27 and 28; the permission of educational institutions of choice to linguistic and religious minorities in articles 29 and 30; the promise of equal ballots devoid of sectional preferences in article 325 — all make for a constitutional architecture which is devoid of any religious preference whatsoever. god is significantly absent throughout the constitution. “one nation under god” is not the allegiance which the constitution seeks of its citizens. believer, atheist and agnostic alike, the constitution does not differentiate., there are however provisions which seek to enforce equality within the hindu religion in articles 17 and 25(2)(b). deference to hindu sentiments on cow slaughter is also provided for in article 48, as is the pious hope for a uniform civil code in article 44. taken as a whole package, the constitutional vision of secularism is one of principled equidistance from all religious matters, while at the same time regulating its practice in a manner consistent with the demands of a modern society. crucially, in article 25(2)(a), we can find constitutional permission for the state to regulate or restrict “any economic, financial, political or other secular activity which may be associated with religious practice”., thus, it is fallacious to argue that the original constitution as adopted, enacted and given to ourselves on november 26, 1949, was not a secular document. the inclusion in the preamble of the words “socialist” and “secular” by the 42nd amendment on january 3, 1977, only headlined what was already present in the original text of the constitution. we must also remember that the preamble itself was drafted only after the constitution was approved by the constituent assembly. the preamble thus became a one-page mission statement of the republic’s intent., read: >constitution is our holy book, says modi, debate over amendmentin fact, there is an illuminating discussion in the constituent assembly debates of november 15, 1949, when professor k.t. shah wanted to include the words “secular, federal, socialist” in article 1 of the constitution, the article that now reads, “india, that is bharat, shall be a union of states...”, prof. shah said, “as regards the secular character of the state, we have been told time and again from every platform that ours is a secular state. if that is true, if that holds good, i do not see why the term could not be added or inserted in the constitution itself, once again, to guard against any possibility of misunderstanding or misapprehension... the secularity of the state must be stressed in view not only of the unhappy experiences we had last year and in the years before and the excesses to which, in the name of religion, communalism or sectarianism can go, but i intend also to emphasise by this description the character and nature of the state which we are constituting today….”, dr. b.r. ambedkar, in reply, said, “mr. vice-president, sir, i regret that i cannot accept the amendment of prof. k.t. shah. my objections, stated briefly, are two. in the first place the constitution, as i stated in my opening speech in support of the motion i made before the house, is merely a mechanism for the purpose of regulating the work of the various organs of the state. it is not a mechanism whereby particular members or particular parties are installed in office. what should be the policy of the state, how the society should be organised in its social and economic side, are matters which must be decided by the people themselves according to time and circumstances. it cannot be laid down in the constitution itself, because that is destroying democracy altogether. if you state in the constitution that the social organisation of the state shall take a particular form, you are, in my judgment, taking away the liberty of the people to decide what should be the social organisation in which they wish to live. it is perfectly possible today for the majority people to hold that the socialist organisation of society is better than the capitalist organisation of society. but it would be perfectly possible for thinking people to devise some other form of social organisation which might be better than the socialist organisation of today or of tomorrow. i do not see therefore why the constitution should tie down the people to live in a particular form and not leave it to the people to decide it for themselves. this is one reason why the amendment should be opposed. the second reason is that the amendment is purely superfluous. my honourable friend, professor shah, does not seem to have taken into account the fact that apart from the fundamental rights, which we have embodied in the constitution, we have also introduced other sections which deal with directive principles of state policy... what i would like to ask professor shah is this: if these directive principles to which i have drawn attention are not socialistic in their direction and in their content, i fail to understand what more socialism can be. therefore my submission is that these socialist principles are already embodied in our constitution and it is unnecessary to accept this amendment.”, prof. shah’s amendment was defeated but two things stand out in this exchange. first, the economist in dr. ambedkar dominated his exchange with prof. shah. he only discussed the economic philosophy of the constitution and did not deal with the questions of secularism and federalism. second, he felt that what was already explicit in the constitution need not be reiterated.",0.06369377337119275,secular spirit letter,"november 26 , constitution day , union home minister rajnath

2015-12-12,the musclemen of hindutva,"vishwa hindu parishad’s new delhi office, which also houses the office of its youth wing, the bajrang dal. file | photo credit: the hindu , twenty-three years after it was banned following the demolition of the babri masjid in ayodhya, the bajrang dal on december 6 this year >renewed its pledge for a ram temple at the mosque site. the anniversary of the demolition is technically a day of “valour” (shaurya diwas) for the hindutva outfit. this year, however, shaurya diwas wasn’t subdued as in many past years. there were elaborate press releases and there was heightened activity on right-wing twitter handles in support of a grand ram temple in ayodhya. in fact, it also appeared to be a coming-out party for the bajrang dal that has for many years now kept in the shadows of other sangh organisations., “we feel something will soon have to be done about the ram temple. the allahabad high court and the archaeological survey of india said there was a temple. yet, sections of muslims and secularists are in denial. for how long can such denial continue?” said surendra jain, all-india adviser to the bajrang dal. “this year we urged muslims to celebrate december 6 like eid.” mr. jain, a former bajrang dal convener, is at present also the joint general secretary of the vishwa hindu parishad (vhp), of which the bajrang dal is the youth wing., there is a palpable spring in the stride of bajrang dal activists at a time when “intolerance” is being discussed within and outside parliament. however, till now it has been more in the nature of open statements rather than large mobilisation. the event at karsevakpuram in ayodhya had speeches, but did not draw a huge crowd., but why does the bajrang dal celebrate as an occasion of “valour” an event that led to an immediate ban, apart from sparking riots in many parts of india, in 1992? “ban or no ban isn’t the issue,” retorted mr. jain without a touch of remorse. “governments have unleashed repression for a few muslim votes. the babri structure was a symbol of past slavery. so, hindus removed it. a temple should be rebuilt just as the historic somnath temple destroyed by mahmud ghazni was rebuilt after independence.”, the last time the bajrang dal was in the eye of a storm was during the anti-christian riots in kandhamal in odisha in 2008. there were allegations of its involvement and the united progressive alliance government had then considered banning it., pattern of deniability dara singh, who was accused of involvement in the 1999 murder of the missionary graham staines in odisha, was reportedly its worker. but the bajrang dal denies he was ever its member. it is part of a pattern of deniability. in 2007, the bajrang dal disowned babu bajrangi of gujarat after he received a supreme court notice for allegedly trying to separate hindu girls (who had married outside their caste) from their husbands; bajrangi was later convicted in connection with the 2002 gujarat riots. the dal has also attracted criticism for moral policing and hounding out the artist, m.f. husain, for his sketches of hindu goddesses, something it actually flaunts as an achievement., the bajrang dal may have been discussed quite often, but few outside its circles know more about the organisation, its work, and the reasons why it came into being. in 2008, i had set out to interview the delhi convener of the bajrang dal when it was blamed for the kandhamal violence, in which about 40 people were killed. the dal’s then delhi convenor, ashok kapoor, invited me to meet him at a vhp office at jhandewalan in the capital. the receptionist, however, denied that the place had any bajrang dal office. when i called up mr. kapoor and made the two men talk, the receptionist was friendlier and served me tea. it was at mr. kapoor’s residence that we met the next day., asked why there was this apparent secrecy about the dal’s office at jhandewalan, a senior vhp leader said that my information was wrong and the dal’s office was at r.k. puram, and not jhandewalan. but yet another vhp leader told me that while r.k. puram houses the central office of the dal, jhandewalan houses the delhi state office. unpacking the dal is, thus, akin to joining the dots., offshoot of the temple movement it was the ram temple movement that marked the dal’s creation. it was set up in 1984 for the “safety and success” of the ram janaki raths that were travelling in various parts of uttar pradesh to mobilise support in favour of a ram temple at the site where the babri masjid then stood. it was claimed that mir baqi, a general of mughal emperor babur, had demolished a ram temple at the birthplace of ram in ayodhya and constructed the babri mosque there., the dal helped execute all the decisions taken by “sants” in relation to the ram janmabhoomi campaign, recalled prakash sharma, who spent 25 years with the bajrang dal, rising to become its national convener in 2002. the decisions that the dal helped execute were ram shila poojan (worship of consecrated bricks) in 1989, shilanyas (symbolic temple foundation-laying ceremony) in 1989, the taking of the ram jyoti (light) to hindu homes in 1990, and the kar seva in ayodhya on october 30, 1990, where there was police firing., the dal soon spread to bihar, delhi, gujarat, madhya pradesh and rajasthan. in july 1993, after the ban was revoked, the bajrang dal became an all-india organisation with vinay katiyar, now a bharatiya janata party (bjp) leader, as its first chief., after mr. katiyar, jaibhan singh pavaiya, surendra jain, prakash sharma and subhash chauhan became bajrang dal heads. the present convener, rajesh pandey, is from rewa in madhya pradesh., undivided parivar the dal is part of the sangh parivar — the large family of rashtriya swayamsevak sangh (rss)-allied organisations formed by its gradual outreach to different segments of society — as the youth wing of the vhp, which was itself founded in 1964 by shiv shankar apte, an rss pracharak. the vhp was aimed at forging common ground among multiple hindu sects that sometimes had doctrinal differences., at the central level, the dal has activists below the age of 45, while at the state level, the cut-off age is 40. a similar arrangement exists for the women’s forums — those below 35 are part of durga vahini, the vhp’s young women’s wing, while those above 35 are part of matru shakti (mother power), clearly aligning to the idea of a woman’s primary role being necessarily of a “mother” beyond a cut-off age., the sangh’s allied organisations are functionally autonomous but the link with the rss never snaps. the akhil bharatiya vidyarthi parishad (abvp) works on campuses, the bharatiya mazdoor sangh (bms) among workers, the bjp in the electoral arena, the vanvasi kalyan ashram among tribals, and so on. representatives of the entire ideological family (vichar parivar) meet routinely and exchange notes on their activities., people also move from one organisation to another. while a chunk of bjp leaders come from the abvp, leaders such as mr. katiyar have come from the bajrang dal. mr. sharma, the dal’s convener from 2002 to 2009, is now vice-president of the bjp’s uttar pradesh unit., levels of stridency and forms of articulation of the central ideology of hindutva differ among sangh-allied organisations. the bajrang dal is seen as among the most aggressive, and the bjp, which has electoral compulsions, the most reticent. while the bjp is largely wedded to market capitalism now, the bms speaks a pro-labour language. the bajrang dal, however, assertively voices hindutva causes, often involving socially divisive issues., life in the bajrang dal the organisational structure of the bajrang dal has several tiers — the national, zonal, state, zilla and prakhand (up to one lakh population) levels; each has conveners and co-conveners., there are some key activities that bind its cadre. once a week, there is a hanuman chalisa recital, generally in temples. this apart, a dal worker is expected to be part of a local balopasana (worship of physical strength) kendra, which is generally a wrestling akhada, or gymnasium., the dal also has a vidyarthi pramukh, an activist who is expected to spread its influence among students. but this work is strictly non-political, as the abvp is active in the sphere of student politics — of course, the reach of the dal is not a patch on that of the abvp. while these activities are seen by the dal as organisational work, it also sees work involving agitation as crucial to its scheme of things. its involvement in the ram temple campaign is one such example. another is cow protection, which has been in the news through the year. the dal mobilises opinion against cow slaughter and even captures vehicles apparently transporting cows for slaughter. they file police complaints but are open to courting confrontation when required, said a dal functionary. the bajrang dal also counts helping organise an amarnath yatra in 1996 as a major milestone in its activity involving agitation, mr. sharma said., the organisation claims a “softer side” that it seeks to showcase, though few take this seriously. “we do constructive social work too, like organising blood donation camps and offering service in hospitals,” he added., the bajrang dal observes hanuman jayanti as balopasana diwas. dal insiders say that the ideal activist should be in the image of hanuman, strong in body and character, and ready to punish evildoers. of course, it is a confrontational hindutva line that informs its definition of character, leading to the viewing of potential stand-offs over cow protection or a ram temple as central to its vision.",0.07191546928249054,musclemen hindutva,"vishwa hindu parishad ’ new delhi office , also houses office youth wing , bajrang dal. file &#124;

2016-01-19,'you can’t create a country on the basis of fear',"diana l eck is the professor of comparative religion and indian studies at harvard university— photo: special arragement , diana l eck is the professor of comparative religion and indian studies at harvard university. over decades of her travels in india’s pilgrimage sites, particularly varanasi, she has written several books, which include banaras: city of light , darsan: seeing the divine image in india , and india: a sacred geography . she is the founder of the pluralism project, a web-based resource for various indian communities in the united states. in 1998, she received the national humanities medal from then us president bill clinton. she is on a visit to mumbai to deliver the vasant j sheth memorial lecture titled ‘sacred rivers, the lifelines of india.’ ahead of her talk on tuesday, she spoke to the hindu on her experience of india, and on issues of pluralism and tolerance., has the indian people’s relationship with rivers undergone a change?, that really is not for me to say. look at the enormous number of people converging at the kumbh mela for example. the gatherings at nashik and simhastha in ujjain are becoming bigger. i can’t measure in terms of population. i was in varanasi during makar sankranti and there was a huge outpouring of people all along the ganga. it looks to me that rivers are still the primary altars of religious life in india. the issue of fresh running water is important not just for the religious lives of the hindus, but for the nation, its people. not very much has been done for the ganga, though. despite many iterations of the ganga action plan, there hasn’t been much action. we still have a multitude of nullahs and raw sewage pouring into the river. many earlier studies have proposed ways of channelling the nullahs and sewage leakages into a deep pipe system that would be carried into some large settling base. but there hasn’t even been a pilot. some beautification measures have taken place, but these are not effective in addressing the problem. they are important as ways of addressing the attitude., why does varanasi have a special place in the west’s imagination of india?, the experience of dawn along the river in varanasi is profoundly moving. also, the encounter with death on a day-to-day basis; the fact that death is not excluded from daily activity. there is a kind of integration of life and death at manikarnika or harishchandra ghats, which is both healthy and profound. varanasi also has a reputation for being a city of ebullient life, commerce and culture, and at the same time a place where people come to die., do you think as a land of diversity, india is pluralistic?, by pluralism, i don’t mean just tolerance or diversity, but an engagement with that diversity. out of diversity we build a common culture. on the whole, india has done that. some would say the foundation of indian pluralism is basically hindu. there is also the great legacy of the sufis in india that is still extant, and of islam. india has a long experience with day-to-day pluralism. sometimes it breaks down and you have eruptions of communalism: your neighbours suddenly become enemies. one struggles to understand this. is it only because our differences are being exploited by fearmongering politicians? in the united states, we have a fear industry telling everyone that we should be afraid of immigrants and muslims. fear is a dangerous thing. you can’t create a country on the basis of fear. you can’t have a democracy in which we fear our neighbours., how do caste divisions and practices fit into the concept of indian unity?, that’s a difficult question to answer, because it poses a whole set of differences that are not so much religious, but social. in an ideal world, you could say india is a society in which community is not based on sameness. there is the idea that you are born into different kinds of skills. we have different religious and caste backgrounds, but it does not mean we don’t fit together and cannot function harmoniously. because we can never all be equal, except spiritually. the question is how we live creatively with our differences, and in india that includes caste differences. some differences have been slightly erased in urban areas., recent events in india have highlighted secularism and religious tolerance due to some violent incidents related to the beef ban law. do these incidents point perhaps to a brahminical supremacist view of indian culture?, for someone who lives in the us and has not lived in india for months at a time, the consciousness of what it means to be one nation composed of different people is quite high. so when you see chauvinism or fundamentalism, people are uncomfortable with that. people being attacked on the suspicion of eating beef makes headlines in the us because it is provocative. it is appalling actually. the idea that there would be legislation on what you eat in a country like india, where people eat many different kinds of things, becomes leverage for violence. people would say that brahminical culture is on the wane. so much of hindu culture is unfazed by brahminical structures. it is popular bhakti religiousness., some reviews of your book india – a sacred geography say your evidence contradicts the idea that india was not a nation before the british came. would you like to elaborate?",0.07408470002220002,' ’ create country basis fear ',"diana l eck professor comparative religion indian studies harvard university — photo : special arragement , diana l eck professor comparative religion indian studies harvard university. decades travels india ’ pilgrimage sites , particularly varanasi , written several books , include banaras : city light , darsan : seeing divine image india , india : sacred geography . founder pluralism project , web-based resource various indian communities united states. 1998 , received national humanities medal us president bill clinton. visit mumbai deliver vasant j sheth memorial lecture titled ‘sacred rivers , lifelines india. ’ ahead talk tuesday , spoke hindu experience india , issues pluralism tolerance. , indian people ’ relationship rivers undergone change?

2016-01-20,"ancient prejudice, modern inequality","students from various universities stage a protest in hyderabad, demanding justice in the aftermath of suicide of university of hyderabad scholar rohith vemula. photo: k.v.s. giri , on sunday, january 17, rohith vemula (25), a doctoral student at the university of hyderabad, >reportedly committed suicide by hanging himself from the ceiling fan in a friend’s hostel room. his death has brought to a head a long-simmering conflict between progressive student groups, and the akhil bharatiya vidyarthi parishad (abvp), the students’ wing of the rashtriya swayamsevak sangh (rss), present on campuses across the country and increasingly belligerent in the prevailing climate of hindu right-wing dominance., rohith, a dalit, had been involved in campus activism on diverse issues: ambedkarite politics, protests against beef bans, the persistence of the death penalty in the indian criminal justice system, and communal violence in muzaffarnagar in august-september 2013, which left many dead and thousands displaced, mostly muslims., along with four other dalit students, rohith had been evicted from his hostel accommodation about a month ago, his monthly research stipend suspended, allegedly for subversive activities. the university administration as well as the state and central governments all appear to have been strong-armed by the reactionary abvp into expelling these five individuals on dubious charges, characterising the victimised students as “casteist”, “extremist” and “anti-national”. all of them belonged to the ambedkar students association, a body similar to the >ambedkar-periyar study circle of the indian institute of technology, madras (iit-m), a group that had also faced harassment and intimidation from campus authorities in the summer of 2015., caste and the hindu right the conflicts in both the university of hyderabad and the iit-m illustrate a deep fracture between the hindu right and dalit-bahujan ideologies, particularly those of the ambedkarite strain, a fault line that cannot be papered over by electoral alliances of convenience and occasional instances of power-sharing between the two sides. the sangh parivar at every level, from the ruling bharatiya janata party down to the abvp, stands against equality, whether between castes, religious communities, or the sexes., instead of egalitarianism, the hindu right believes in an archaic arithmetic of adhikaar and bahishkaar, entitlement and exclusion, based on caste, religion and gender. if the indian republic is built on a plinth of equal citizenship, the hindu rashtra would be founded on ritual hierarchy and patriarchy as laid out for centuries in the caste system. onto this unequal social order of considerable vintage would be layered a deadly neo-fascist majoritarian politics that arises out of the hindutva imagination of the modern nation., this is why, when the ambedkar students association supported the screening of nakul singh sawhney’s film muzaffarnagar baaqi hai on the university of hyderabad campus, the abvp attacked the dalit activist-students, driving them out of their classrooms and hostels, eventually to the limit where rohith took the irreversible decision to end his life. photographs he posted on his facebook page in 2014 of his parents’ home in the small town of guntur — a prized red refrigerator in which all the neighbours kept their water bottles, a gas burner, a fan he wryly described as “solar powered” — suggest the great distance from poverty and hardship travelled by this young man to become a doctoral student at one of the most prestigious universities in india. his journey ended violently and abruptly., but the ostracising of the >sudra and dalit student from the institutions of education and employment, knowledge and power, is a very old theme in indian thought on social structure and moral order. the figure of the outcaste student appears in some of our oldest texts that reflect on the relationship between self, society and sovereignty., in the mahabharata, ekalavya, a talented archer prince of the forest tribe of the nishadas, goes to dronacharya, the master who teaches young men of the pandava and kaurava clans how to wield their weapons. drona will not admit ekalavya on account of the tribal status that makes him an outsider to the caste system. ekalavya goes away, makes an image of drona, secretly watches him give lessons to arjuna and the other royals, and teaches himself archery, treating the mud-and-clay drona as a stand-in for the recalcitrant guru., when ekalavya turns out to be a better bowman than the kshatriya prince arjuna, drona asks for his right thumb as tuition fee. ekalavya agrees, but not without understanding that he is being discriminated against yet again. ekalavya’s initial disobedience (which makes him a secret apprentice) as well as his later compliance (which costs him his thumb) shame both drona and his favourite pupil, the supposed beneficiary of this blatant act of prejudice, arjuna. the story of the nishada prince shows drona up as a caste bigot whose classroom reeks of nepotism, even if he knows how to teach his students well, at least the high-born ones he favours., ekalavya’s dismembered digit, a bloody and visceral embodiment of caste consciousness, has haunted the hindu schoolyard from time immemorial. it can be read as quite literally a thumb in drona’s eye, a jab at our conscience that is as painful for us to experience as it must have been for ekalavya to lose the very source of his hard-earned skill. he is denied access at every stage: he cannot become drona’s pupil, but neither is he allowed to become a great archer through his own efforts., the story of satyakama jabali from the chandogya upanishad is more complex. satyakama has no father, and takes his mother jabala’s name. he goes to the hermitage of the sage gautama, and wants to be admitted. when asked about his parentage, he acknowledges honestly that he does not know his father’s name or caste. gautama admits him nevertheless, and performs the initiation ritual to pronounce him a twice-born brahmin, after which his education begins in earnest., in the ancient text of the upanishad, gautama is willing to entertain satyakama as a potential pupil because of his honesty: he takes the boy’s love of truth (which is the literal meaning of his name, satya-kama) as proof of his essentially brahmin nature. once the teacher has assessed the applicant’s innate worth, he then translates his positive assessment into an upanayana (bestowal of the sacred thread on the boy’s body), naming satyakama a proper brahmin and proceeding to educate him accordingly., satyakama’s brahmin identity is clearly attributed to him; it cannot be proven to be intrinsic, since his mother jabala cannot identify his father. gautama seems to suggest that ‘brahmin is as brahmin does’, i.e., satyakama has the lakshana (characterising feature) of a brahmin (because he speaks the truth), even though he does not have the gotra (lineage) of a brahmin (because his mother was unmarried)., for a modern reader, this is a confusing account. does gautama make an exception and admit a non-brahmin pupil into his hermitage, or does gautama accept satyakama because he thinks he recognises him, despite appearances, to be a genuine brahmin? the exchange between satyakama and gautama at the threshold of the ashram, as it were, raising fundamental questions about identity (who are you? who am i?), about rights to entry into the portals of the academy, about rule and exception in the caste system, and about the entailments of caste in the strongholds of knowledge and seats of power, is again a moment that has not left our collective conscience for two millennia. dr. ambedkar himself reminds us of both these characters, ekalavya and satyakama, who for him are damning evidence of the stubborn longevity of caste in indian history., the more things change… ekalavya did not die and neither did satyakama, but rohith did. this sad fact could lead to various conclusions. it is a reflection on the unexpected cruelty and the adamantine ideologies undergirding the modern state and its institutions of higher learning. drona and ekalavya, gautama and satyakama could to some extent negotiate the terms of their relationship. rohith ostensibly had the might of the indian constitution behind him — his fundamental rights as a citizen, reservations policy for students of his socioeconomic background, and the empowering discourses of the ambedkarite student group which gave him a certain political awareness and the radical energy to fight for the equality he fully expected and deserved, but never got. and yet, when he was rusticated and ousted from his hostel, when he and his companions felt pushed to stage a “sleep-in” outside the university gates; when his stipend was withheld and he had to borrow money, and when he finally felt like he had hit a wall and had no options, rohith was far worse off than his metaphorical brothers in the ancient literature., his heartbreaking suicide note states the piercing truth, the skewer that caste ideology drives into every heart filled with hope: “my birth is my fatal accident.” yes, this is the human condition: our birth, all birth, is an accident. we do not choose our father or mother, our group or community. but only in india, only in caste society, and only for dalits does this accident of coming into an unequal life become the fatality of either living with relentless inequality and enduring its cruelties, or dying a terrible, unfair, premature and unredeemed death.",0.03197102386757559,"ancient prejudice , modern inequality","students

2016-02-15,why our universities are in ferment,"as over two thousand students and teachers of jawaharlal nehru university (jnu) in delhi gathered peacefully on saturday to protest police action on campus and the arrest of the president of the students’ union, a potentially dangerous stampede was set in motion at the front, when at rahul gandhi’s entrance, media people with cameras rushed unheedingly into the thickly clustered people seated on the ground. the situation was exacerbated by a further push into that space by about fifteen akhil bharatiya vidyarthi parishad (abvp) activists holding black flags and shouting slogans against rahul gandhi. within seconds, however, the students conducting the meeting had organised a human chain to hold back and corral the media and the abvp safely into one corner, and the human chain was then immediately taken up by the hundreds of teachers present. until rahul gandhi left, the handful of abvp activists continued their slogans, but they could only be heard by those seated in their immediate vicinity., this is how students and teachers have always maintained, through the gravest provocations, perhaps the most peaceful campus in the country. debate and dissent have always been part of its ethos but never violence, an ethos unfamiliar to those who only know violent suppression of dissent., storm troopers of the sangh, three factors reflected in this account are crucial in understanding the circumstances of many universities that have been in the news recently — the extreme responsibility shown by most students at all times, the matching irresponsibility shown by the visual media in particular, and the role of the abvp as storm troopers of the rashtriya swayamsevak sangh/bharatiya janata party (rss/bjp)., students and young people have been at the forefront of protests across the country for some time now, even before the modi regime came to power, against land acquisition by relentlessly neo-liberal regimes, corruption, sexual harassment, gender discrimination, homophobic politics, cutbacks in education budgets, anti-worker policies and rampant caste-based discrimination. the jadavpur university students’ protest against sexual harassment, the nation-wide upsurge after the december 16, 2012 rape, and student support to striking maruti workers are some instances., lately, many of these protests have been against hindutva-wadi politics — attempts to control the food and dietary habits of large numbers of communities, moral policing of young people, and communal violence set coldly and calculatedly in motion by what paul brass has called ‘institutionalised systems of riot production’. these protests have been militant but utterly non-violent, and they have been relentless. these are not elite young people, as they are often portrayed in the media. thanks to the continued expansion of education, reservation policies, and in universities like jnu, affirmative action through deprivation points, the class, caste and gender profile of these young people is remarkably heterogeneous. like rohith vemula of the university of hyderabad whose charismatic leadership on the basis of a left-inflected ambedkarite political vision and powerful suicide letter galvanised the country; kanhaiya kumar, the arrested jnu students’ union president, in jail for fulfilling his responsibility as elected representative and attempting to maintain peace among abvp and the other students who organised the controversial event; or richa singh, first woman president of the allahabad university students’ union, battling the entrenched patriarchy of the hindi-belt campuses — most of them come from modest to extremely poor families, having battled discrimination of different sorts at every stage. when they enter public universities that still, in what seems to our older generation to be a doomed era, are affordable to many, offer spaces of learning, lively debate, intellectual growth and political understanding of structural injustices, something magical happens. young people from marginalised sections see that social transformation is possible, and that they can be the agents of that transformation., pattern of misrepresentation, as to the irresponsibility of the media, apart from the mindless competition for pictures of celebrities, political or otherwise, the reportage boggles the mind. on saturday at jnu for example, i could hear one reporter say in that breathless manner they all affect, “events at jnu have taken a political turn as leaders of political parties arrive” (as if the political turn had not already taken place with the entry of police on a university campus), and another intone “there is an evident split in the student body with abvp activists showing black flags” (a few thousand students chanting “stand with jnu” and twenty people showing black flags is an evident split!). during the university of hyderabad unrest too, the reportage was completely one-sided until rohith vemula’s suicide forced the media to sit up and take notice., of course, these reporters are young people too, they are doing their job as they know it. one can only hope that somewhere, someone will realise that television can have thoughtful coverage rather than farcical “breaking news” and high decibel meaningless shouting in studios, slanted by the anchor in the direction s/he chooses. one day surely, there will be one channel, at least one programme on a channel, that will not have 24 hour news, but discussion, debate and real attempts to untangle political controversies?, meanwhile, the third factor mentioned above, the abvp across campuses has been given the responsibility of raising the slogan of anti-nationalism wherever democratic aspirations are expressed, or filing some complaint on an innocuous issue, and the ministry of human resource development (mhrd) promptly swoops in to act. grants to panjab university were stopped and salaries not paid after the abvp filed a complaint with the mhrd alleging irregularities in the hostel funds, despite the vice chancellor having instituted an inquiry committee and submitted all records. in the university of hyderabad it is well known that the mhrd pushed the vc to take action, not against the abvp students who attacked the others, but against the ambedkar students’ association., elsewhere, the abvp has filed police complaints on ‘hurting of religious sentiments’ when a hostel warden cautioned against the holding of a ‘havan’ inside a small hostel room, as a fire hazard (jnu); physically threatened the president of the students’ union, but her letters of complaint to the mhrd have been ignored (allahabad university); and in campuses across the country, violently disrupted or tried to disrupt the screening of muzaffarnagar baaqi hai, the documentary by nakul sawhney that clearly shows the culpability of hindutva-wadi organisations in the communal violence in muzaffarnagar. the abvp has also physically attacked organisers of militantly dalit ‘beef festivals’ in campuses in states where cow slaughter is not illegal., pliant vice chancellors, which brings us to a final factor that is critical — university administrations. everywhere, the role of a pliant vice chancellor and key university officials has been crucial in acting with alacrity on the smallest complaint by the abvp.",0.05241964796210077,universities ferment,"two thousand students teachers jawaharlal nehru university ( jnu ) delhi gathered peacefully saturday protest police action campus arrest president students ’ union , potentially dangerous stampede set motion front , rahul gandhi ’ entrance , media people cameras rushed unheedingly thickly clustered people seated ground. situation exacerbated push space fifteen akhil bharatiya vidyarthi parishad ( abvp ) activists holding black flags shouting slogans rahul gandhi. within seconds , however , students conducting meeting organised human chain hold back corral media abvp safely one corner , human chain immediately taken hundreds teachers present. rahul gandhi left , handful abvp activists continued slogans , could heard seated immediate vicinity. , students teachers always maintained , gravest provocations , perhaps peaceful campus country. debate dissent always part ethos never violence , ethos unfamiliar know violent suppression dissent. , storm troopers sangh , three factors reflected account crucial understanding circumstances many universities news recently — extreme responsibility shown students times , matching irresponsibility shown visual media particular , role abvp storm troopers rashtriya swayamsevak sangh/bharatiya janata party ( rss/bjp ) . , students young people forefront protests across country time , even modi regime came power , land acquisition relentlessly neo-liberal regimes , corruption , sexual harassment , gender discrimination , homophobic politics , cutbacks education budgets , anti-worker policies rampant caste-based discrimination. jadavpur university students ’ protest sexual harassment , nation-wide upsurge december 16 , 2012 rape , student support striking maruti workers instances. , lately , many protests hindutva-wadi politics — attempts control food dietary habits large numbers communities , moral policing young people , communal violence set coldly calculatedly motion paul brass called ‘institutionalised systems riot production ’ . protests militant utterly non-violent , relentless. elite young people , often portrayed media. thanks continued expansion education , reservation policies , universities like jnu , affirmative action deprivation points , class , caste gender profile young people remarkably heterogeneous. like rohith vemula university hyderabad whose charismatic leadership basis left-inflected ambedkarite political vision powerful suicide letter galvanised country ;

2016-03-02,emptying the idea of india,"the current strategy of the bharatiya janata party (bjp) is to mount relentless rhetorical attacks on the “anti” in anti-national while leaving the “nation” in national carefully empty. it was showcased in parliament by human resource development >minister smriti irani in her enactment of what a popular film song once referred to as “emosanal atyachar”. but when she said, “i am not certifying your idea of india but do not demean mine”, ms. irani was being unduly modest because she was actually doing much more than “not certifying” the idea of india — she was evacuating it. juxtaposed against the silent emptiness of this idea was the eloquent fullness of her righteous rage against those who would demean it. this clever tactic captured the moral high ground by framing the motion to be debated as “insults to the nation cannot be tolerated”, thus trapping opponents in defensive positions on the swampy terrain of insults by denying them a foothold on any firm conception of the nation. but the ploy worked only as long as the idea of india was left undefined. she was under fire the moment she tried to label mahishasura worship as anti-national, because this defined the nation as exclusively limited to durga worshippers, a specific definition that was immediately challenged., emotion over reasondespite being an intangible idea, the nation is quite real because it is a shared idea. symbols of nationhood are important for this sharing to be reliably reproduced, which is why we have familiar aids to memory like maps, flags, or the figure of mother india. national symbols are extremely powerful because they connect to compressed reservoirs of intense emotion., that is why publicly invoking these symbols has to be an act of responsible citizenship and not self-serving demagoguery, but the difference can be hard to tell. the problem with emotive symbols is that though they can multiply the force of arguments, they cannot replace the arguments themselves. all persuasion harnesses symbols but principled persuasion must also provide arguments that can be rationally debated., the bjp strategy is a cynical ploy to maximise the emotive impact of symbols while refusing reasoned argument. it is cynical in its unfair fixation on a real or imagined “anti” without allowing the accused the space to speak of the conception of nation that informs the allegedly “anti-national” act. the shameless resort to a partisan use of state power to terrorise, silence and break opponents makes this cynicism dangerous. how else can one explain why lawyers who repeatedly indulged in violent assaults on court premises, or journalists who wantonly incited violence based on fake evidence are not in jail — but kanhaiya kumar, umar khalid and anirban bhattacharya are?, to be fair, during the past two decades the nation idea has been under siege globally, and not only in india. when it first came into its own in the nineteenth century, the nation seemed to define a common boundary for cultural belonging, economic interdependence, and political accountability. in the era of globalisation, the cultural, economic and political dimensions of the nation have diverged, thus undermining the sovereignty of the idea itself. in india, these processes began to take effect from the 1980s, long before the dominance of the bjp., weapon of mass distractionagainst this background, narendra modi’s election campaign emphasised inclusive development — sabka saath, sabka vikas — with hindutva as a side show. unfortunately, until now the modi regime has been unable to deliver on virtually all of its promises on the economic front — it remains to be seen whether the 2016 budget will effect a welcome change of direction. the sudden deepening of inequalities has fuelled frustrations among the very groups that were its most enthusiastic supporters, such as patidars, jats or the urban middle classes., historically, regimes unable to provide bread have had to stage circuses of one kind or another to retain their credibility. these have taken the form of highly publicised programmes and campaigns with little or no real content, like swachh bharat abhiyan or beti bachao beti padhao. because of these economic setbacks, the cultural front has had to bear a heavier burden. there has been a marked escalation in communal tensions, with various “fringe” outfits and individuals taking on a central role. the characteristic form of these events is a claimed insult to hindu sentiment or “indian culture”. why do these campaigns invariably take a negative form, from the attempts to convert valentine’s day into parents’ day or christmas into good governance day, through the beef ban, right up to the ayodhya ram mandir campaign? is it really impossible to become a good hindu today without opposing someone or something else?, the changing campusit is in this context that we need to place the quiet revolution in higher education that has taken place over the past two decades. today, in most non-technical institutions of higher learning women equal or exceed male students in numbers. after the 93rd constitutional amendment extended reservations, the caste (and class) composition of elite universities has been transformed. while muslims remain under-represented, most others have gained access, making our universities the only public spaces in contemporary india where almost all groups (barring the poorest) can meet and mingle in a relatively egalitarian setting. this newly democratised site is proving to be a massive source of anxiety and resentment for the current regime. campuses like those of the university of hyderabad or jawaharlal nehru university are seen as particularly dangerous because they are spaces where dalits are not only assertive but are making common cause with other marginalised groups including muslims., hence the vicious campaign against radical students and campuses, and the relentless repetition of the charge of being “anti-national”. the bitter irony here is that while the accused have been describing the india — and, as with rohith vemula, the world — that they stand for in passionate detail, the accusers have offered only the thinnest and emptiest of descriptions. nothing illustrates this better than the bizarre proposal to hoist gigantic national flags in universities. even more telling is the plan to showcase tanks and artillery on campuses in the hope that they will exude patriotism and provide immunity against the dreaded disease of critical thinking., whether it is sent intentionally or subconsciously, the message is sinister. the university and the army are at opposite ends of the state apparatus, one representing the nation’s desire to nurture critical perspectives and innovative thinking that will strengthen its ability to respond to change, the other representing the might of the state to be deployed after all hope of peaceful resolution is lost. by invoking the arm of the state that is the last resort of brute force in defence of the nation, is the government implying that it thinks of universities as enemy territory that must be conquered by force?",0.032736452535559686,emptying idea india,"current strategy bharatiya janata party ( bjp ) mount relentless rhetorical attacks “anti ” anti-national leaving “nation ” national carefully empty. showcased parliament human resource development >minister smriti irani enactment popular film song referred “emosanal atyachar ” . said , “i certifying idea india demean mine ” , ms. irani unduly modest actually much “not certifying ” idea india — evacuating it. juxtaposed silent emptiness idea eloquent fullness righteous rage would demean it. clever tactic captured moral high ground framing motion debated “insults nation cannot tolerated ” , thus trapping opponents defensive positions swampy terrain insults denying foothold firm conception nation. ploy worked long idea india left undefined. fire moment tried label mahishasura worship anti-national , defined nation exclusively limited durga worshippers , specific definition immediately challenged. , emotion reasondespite intangible idea , nation quite real shared idea. symbols nationhood important sharing reliably reproduced , familiar aids memory like maps , flags , figure mother india. national symbols extremely powerful connect compressed reservoirs intense emotion. , publicly invoking symbols act responsible citizenship self-serving demagoguery , difference hard tell. problem emotive symbols though multiply force arguments , cannot replace arguments themselves. persuasion harnesses symbols principled persuasion must also provide arguments rationally debated. , bjp strategy cynical ploy maximise emotive impact symbols refusing reasoned argument. cynical unfair fixation real imagined “anti ” without allowing accused space speak conception nation informs allegedly “anti-national ” act. shameless resort partisan use state power terrorise , silence break opponents makes cynicism dangerous. else one explain lawyers repeatedly indulged violent assaults court premises , journalists wantonly incited violence based fake evidence jail — kanhaiya kumar , umar khalid anirban bhattacharya are?

2016-05-02,"parched earth, broken promises","photo shows the people of ukhanda village in beed district waiting for a water tanker. photo: vivek bendre , how would janabai korde or prabhakar bhumre have responded to the government’s claims made in the rajya sabha that the centre was doing everything it could to address the grave drought situation in 257 districts across india? the two are residents of beed and jalna in marathwada, the region comprising the eight districts worst hit by a three-year drought, and which has now reached epic proportions., janabai korde is the sarpanch of a village in beed. our team met her when, as part of the kisan sabha campaign in the marathwada region, we were interacting with workers at mahatma gandhi national rural employment guarantee act (mgnrega) worksites. with agricultural work at a standstill, the only lifeline here is mgnrega. the central government had declared that the provision of work under mgnrega would be extended from 100 to 150 days in all drought-affected areas. but this has not happened. in 2015-2016, according to the ministry website, in five of the districts — aurangabad, jalna, nanded, osmanabad and hingoli — the average days of work in each of the districts was just 47 days or lower. in latur it was 72 days, and in beed, 81., mgnrega and a fund trickle even though lakhs of landless agricultural workers, cane cutters and marginal farmers are desperately looking for work, the number of individuals who actually got work under mgnrega last year was just 70,000 people or fewer in each district. the only exception was in beed, where 1.19 lakh individual workers got work. this month, when demand is at its peak, the average figure in each district is just 4,000. officials tell you, off the record, that the main reason is the central government’s refusal to release adequate funds. for the state as a whole, the funds from the centre in 2015-2016 have been less, by rs.212 crore, than what was spent in the pre-drought year of 2012-2013., what is equally appalling is that even those who got work did not get wages. beed district, with a comparatively better record of providing work, was the worst in terms of the disbursal of wages. last year, the government owed workers rs.5.58 crore in terms of wages in this district. at a worksite where we met ms. korde in her village of takarwan, 150 workers had not been paid even a paisa since the project began a month-and-a-half ago. in the searing heat, with scarce drinking water, the women are expected to dig and carry 5,000 kg of mud in a single workday of eight hours. can there be a more inhuman work norm than this? it is an impossible task. officials admit that because of the drought, the soil has become hard and stony. but the schedule of rates — that is the work norms which determine the piece-rated wages — has not been changed. as a result, workers will get around 30 per cent less than the minimum wage, unless they extend the workday to 11 or 12 hours. ms. korde has been fighting on behalf of the workers. she has also raised the crucial issue of food security. emergency measures to provide food grains through the public distribution system are urgently required, she says, but who is listening?, landless and agricultural workers, the vast majority of whom are dalit, are obviously the worst hit but the plight of farmers is no better., farmers in distress, prabhakar bhumre is a farmer from jalna district. like many others here, he was a fruit grower with 400 orange trees. he had taken a loan of rs.2 lakh over two years. but in spite of the large amounts he paid to private companies for water to be supplied, he could not save his trees from drying up. ultimately, he had to cut them down. his is not an isolated case. in the district, orange trees which were planted over 9,000 hectares — which is more than a third of the land where these trees have been planted — have had to be cut down. but there is little government help. nor have the majority of fruit growers in the region received any compensation. on the contrary, banks are sending notices to farmers like mr. bhumre across marathwada demanding repayment. the despair is palpable and 325 farmers have committed suicide in this region since january this year., we had met mr. bhumre at a cattle sale in pachod in aurangabad district where he had sold two pairs of bullocks. sitting in a group of distraught farmers, he was dejected and close to tears. he had sold the animals, bought for rs.1 lakh a year or so ago, for just rs.20,000. another farmer, salar khan, had a similiar story. he had sold a pair of bullocks for half the price he had paid for them. in debt, for rs.90,000, his daughters have had to drop out of school. after the ban on cow slaughter imposed by the bharatiya janata party-led government, the price of these animals has plummeted throughout the state. in the marathwada region, the situation is further accentuated by the high cost of maintenance. there were around 3,000 heads of cattle brought for sale to this fair — a distress sale is a last-ditch survival strategy. they had no alternative., short changed, the cattle shelters set up under a government scheme could have provided some relief. but the government outsourced them to a variety of registered cooperatives. in beed district, where the late bjp leader gopinath munde’s two daughters fought and won the election, there are 137 such cow shelters, the highest in the region. one of the bigger shelters, in kej, with 1,400 animals, is run by the jai bajrang bali society which has not received funds since it started in march. according to the supervisor, the running cost is close to rs.1 lakh a day., how do they manage, we asked. through more loans, he said. however, others said that many of these registered societies do not give out the actual amount of fodder that a farmer is entitled to. the government subsidy to be provided in kind, and fodder and water for the animals is set at the rate of rs.70 for a large animal and rs.31 for a small one. but, in a bizarre policy decision, the government cuts rs.8 of the subsidy per animal against the price for the manure that the owner is presumed to get, from the sale of the manure. this has infuriated cattle owners. one asked, “did a government officer measure the manure of my cow before he cut eight rupees?”, in most districts, the scheme for cattle shelters has not taken off. clearly, it is the government that should run these shelters in greater numbers for a specified period and the central government needs to provide assistance for this. no assurances were made in the parliamentary debate., water politics",-0.0162656953328595,"parched earth , broken promises","photo shows people ukhanda village beed district waiting water tanker. photo : vivek bendre , would janabai korde prabhakar bhumre responded government ’ claims made rajya sabha centre everything could address grave drought situation 257 districts across india ?

2016-05-28,‘i have a right to my opinion’,"“we are not in the ignorant india of the 60s when we would have blindly put the stamp on the hand (the congress symbol),” says actor rishi kapoor. photo: getty images , rishi kapoor is the ultimate romantic hero for an entire generation that has grown up on films like bobby, amar, akbar, anthony and khel khel mein. he was sweet, sentimental, uncomplicated. but in his second innings in bollywood, he has shifted gears dramatically to play experimental and challenging roles — from the butcher rauf lala in agneepath to a marwari caterer in shuddh desi romance, from a dawood-like villain in d day to a lascivious grandfather in kapoor & sons., significantly, kapoor’s second innings is also about a hitherto unseen political persona coming to light through the candid opinions he airs regularly on twitter. his tweets questioning the naming of public places after the nehru and gandhi families have blown up into a huge controversy, exciting furious debate on social media and leading to his apartment being stoned., on social media, amid a sea of actors promoting their own films, his is a refreshing voice, with intelligent and witty takes on the world around him., we meet him in his quiet apartment off bandra’s busy hill road to ask about his new political persona. he was sprawled on a lounge chair watching tv news when we walked in. between sips of pudina chhaas and calls from his sister and nana patekar, kapoor spoke about the debate he has unleashed, and his engagement with politics and social media. excerpts:, when you tweeted about places named after the nehru and gandhi families, did you foresee this uproar?, i never imagined it would unleash such a furore; that it would balloon into this controversy. i am being called anti-congress; that i am against the gandhi family. my family, right from the time of my great grandfather, has been known to be congressi. but that doesn’t mean we’ll follow everything without questioning. we are not in the ignorant india of the 60s when we would have blindly put the stamp on the hand (the congress symbol)., i can’t understand why people are taking such umbrage. i haven’t spoken against the family. i took on the party and its cronies who are using the (family) name everywhere, for anything and everything. how am i wrong in saying that people are exploiting the nehru-gandhi name? how can you defend 64 places in delhi alone named after them? why are we fooling the people? i have the greatest respect and regard for the family but i will take all the stones hurled. my statement has been misconstrued but then the truth is always bitter. but i am also overwhelmed by the unprecedented support. people have said that deep down they felt the same way but were scared to say it out loud. however, bravery was not my intent. anyhow, it’s all water under the bridge now., so there was nothing premeditated about your tweets?, it was just an innocent observation. i was watching the 10:00 p.m. news about the renaming of akbar road in delhi and the thought came to me, and i tweeted. they are asking me why i didn’t say it when the upa was in power. but it didn’t occur to me then. i am not putting down the party because it is no longer in power. the issue of akbar road never arose back then., you think this practice can be changed?, we should change things constitutionally. we should legislate that no monument or public place will be named after politicians. there have been so many great people who have contributed to the growth of india. after 70 years of independence, why don’t we give credit to those other than politicians?, how political are you as a person?, in the south, actors have been actively involved in politics. i don’t understand politics, and i have no political aspirations. i am happy being an abhineta, not a neta. i live in my own world, in my own space. in the last 100 years of cinema, my family has been associated with the medium for 86 years., why should i deviate from that tradition? acting gives me a high. but that doesn’t mean i cannot reflect on things. i watch television, i read newspapers. i decide what is good and bad. i am a responsible, tax-paying citizen and i have a right to my opinion, and you can’t get violent with me or victimise me for it. you should take me on, on a proper debating platform instead of hurling stones at my house. in the 40 years of my career, i haven’t been given any recognition although actors junior to me have been given awards. my conscience doesn’t want any award, especially now., why?, because they will say i made these statements only to earn awards. i didn’t tweet with any personal gain in mind. they are saying i am pro-bjp but i have categorically opposed bjp in the past. i have opposed the beef ban, the ban on alcohol in bihar. i am not a spokesperson for any political person or party. i have campaigned only once in the elections, for vinod khanna in gurdaspur, but that was not as a party member but because he is a colleague. this is the reason film personalities don’t express opinions on important issues. there is an immediate reaction and things get way too much prominence., does it affect the business of their films as well?, i don’t think so. people reject a film only if they don’t like it. they forget the controversies when they step into the theatre., are you on any other social media platform?, i was on facebook but the account got hacked twice, so i just gave up on it., so how did twitter begin for you?, i would put the blame on anushka (sharma). she introduced me to it, but my account was lying defunct for very long till abhishek (bachchan) got me involved in it. then, it started as a lark, just over a year ago. i got on it to interact with friends, companions and fans but gradually realised that anything you say there gets picked up by the media and can get magnified., i am not using it to make a statement or to glorify myself. what i say is honest, sincere and innocent, without any malice involved. it’s not to hurt anyone intentionally. i just speak the truth. sometimes, i may have tweeted something wrong as well but i have accepted that, apologised and taken it back. human beings make mistakes., your twitter feed is remarkably refreshing and spontaneous., shouldn’t it be that way? some people use the platform for effect. at my age, i don’t need to. they often say i tweet when i am drunk, which is a completely baseless allegation. i do fun things on twitter. i enjoy it. i talk about the real kapoor & sons. that’s the way i am, regaling friends with simple, honest talk. i make myself the butt of my jokes like the one i cracked recently on obesity in the kapoor family. (“obesity is not because it runs in the kapoor family! it is because no one runs in the kapoor family!”), are you as forthright in life as you are on twitter?, i can be very diplomatic if i want to, if i have to avoid conflict. but i will now get more cautious on twitter. i have never been in a controversy in my life, never challenged anyone. my wife doesn’t like it at all. she gets annoyed., is it because of the negativity, the trolls?, i block the trolls. there is this fake vinod mehta handle that has been after me and i was taken aback initially because i know he is no more. in fact, if editors like mehta and khushwant singh were alive, they would have lauded me for my stand and my tweets. there are also people who just abuse actors out of habit, which i take with a pinch of salt., we never saw this opinionated side of you as a young actor., i think it comes with maturity, experience and the power of rationality., who are the other film personalities on twitter who you think have strong opinions like you?, i think shirish kunder is very witty in the way he puts things across. shabana (azmi) is quite political.…, the films you were associated with when young, and the films your son is doing — how different are they?, i keep telling ranbir i became a hero in rs. 2.50 and you have become one in rs. 250. the scale has changed. back then song-and-dance was an intrinsic part of ‘young’ films. it still is, but the box office game is changing. formulaic films are failing and the non-formulaic is working. the line between art house and mainstream is blurring. there’s only a rare bajrangi bhaijaan that has universal appeal. i did offbeat films like doosra aadmi and ek chadar maili si back then, both of which failed. i was stuck with the identity of a lover boy in colourful sweaters singing songs in ooty and switzerland. i wasn’t given enough challenging roles. on the other hand, ranbir was liked immensely in wake up sid, rockstar and barfi. but when he did a formulaic besharam, he fell flat on his face. it’s a boon as well as bane for today’s young actors., why do you say that?, because the viewer has become wiser and intelligent. she is more sharp and demanding. the stars are also well-informed and competent, right from the start, while we learnt through experience and grew. we honed our skills through trial and error. the audience was more innocent and forgiving, back then. in my days, every actor was working in several films, of which four were mandatorily on the lost-and-found formula. since money was not constant, we used to work in as many as 15 films together, on many shifts., the transition from lover boy to character roles appears seamless in your case. it is as if you never went away., i worked without a break for long. i upped the youth quotient. till i came along, older stars were playing college students. that was broken and overnight, they were without a job. i sang songs dedicatedly for 25 years. only the khan stardom has lasted that long. i would have lasted another two-three years as a lover boy but i put on weight and newcomers came along. in 1998, i did karobar, my last film as a romantic hero. then i took a break and directed aa ab laut chalein. then two friends, rahul rawail and veeru devgan, got me back to acting., how do things feel at the moment?, i don’t need to be on the conveyor belt, don’t need to keep myself busy. i need a film to inspire me, to challenge me. the script should make me say “bingo! i need to start shooting tomorrow”. i am at a stage when not many roles are being written for me. also, i am not as saleable and need a young actor to balance it out, get the audiences to the theatre. despite this, i got to do do dooni chaar and kapoor & sons, which were off the curve. i started acting when i was 15. now, i have played a 90-year-old in kapoor & sons. i know you didn’t like me in it, but it was important for me as an actor to have covered the entire spectrum., what’s next?, i have a funny with paresh rawal called patel ki punjabi shaadi. a sports film might be locked in soon., bollywood tweets politics, “a selfie is not a device to bring about change mr. pm. try reform”. this tweet last year, from film and television actor shruti seth, in response to the #selfiewithdaughter campaign, got her a deluge of invective and she eventually had to remove the tweet. but seth is unfazed. “people need to be politically attuned or else we will keep electing wrong people to powerful posts,” she said to the hindu., actor neha dhupia tweeted: “one rain n the city comes to a standstill. good governance is not about selfies n makin us do yoga, it’s making sure ur citizens r safe.” and in response to the beef ban, rishi kapoor tweeted: “i am angry. why do you equate food with religion? i am a beef eating hindu. does that mean i am less god fearing than a non-eater? think!”, till even a few years ago, political beliefs in bollywood were associated only with its ‘intelligentsia’ like shabana azmi, nandita das, javed akhtar, mahesh bhatt, sudhir mishra or hansal mehta. but increasingly, the industry is letting its political slip show. from the beef ban to the intolerance debate (shah rukh khan and aamir khan) to writing opinion pieces in solidarity with students of film and television institute of india (dibakar banerjee), they have been vocal.

people praised him as well., what about the >violence that happened in the patiala house courts complex under his watch?, law took its own course, firs were lodged. if there are provisions under which bail was given, what can be done? nobody is above the law., any move to introduce an anti-conversion law?, some states have this law. himachal pradesh, a congress-ruled state, also has it. it was the congress which introduced it. right now there is no such proposal., are you considering it in the future?, we have freedom of religion in our country, yet we must guard against forcible conversions or through pecuniary enticements. everyone should take precautions about this and there should be no attempts at mass conversions. if it happens on an individual basis, freedom for that is guaranteed under the constitution., what about the ‘ghar wapsi’ campaign by fringe groups?, >i am against mass conversions., the home ministry also looks at two key departments: centre-state relations and communal harmony. your government has been attacked in the last two years on both subjects — for example, the >uttarakhand and >arunachal pradesh crisis., it is the policy of the government as well as my party that we don’t destabilise governments which are working well on their own. whatever happened in arunachal pradesh and uttarakhand was due to the congress’s inability to handle its internal crisis. in arunachal, it is the breakaway faction of the congress which is heading the government, not the bjp. in uttarakhand, nine mlas had broken away when the appropriation bill was discussed in the assembly. our concern is that there should not be untimely and repeated elections., what about communal harmony? your government has been accused of asserting a majoritarian sentiment., please tell me one incident of its kind. communal violence cases have come down. earlier the incidents were virulent and there were deaths due to communal tensions; that is not so now. since the time our government came to power, some people thought they should defame the government. we don’t play politics of caste or creed, we don’t polarise., why are there such misgivings when the bjp comes to power?, the so-called secular political parties want to instil fear among the minorities with regard to the bjp to harvest their support., the heightened communal temperature around cow slaughter and> beef led to heinous incidents like dadri and >jharkhand lynching., it’s the state government’s responsibility. it’s not the centre’s job. i certainly have not stopped anybody from acting as per law., the ban on cow slaughter and the fear around movement of cattle has >hit the economic interests of certain communities., in mughal emperor babur’s vasiyatnama (will), which is a set of instructions he left for his son humayun to rule india, he had clearly written, ya to riyaya ke dil par hukumat chala sakte ho ya khuleaam gay kaa maas kha sakte ho (either you can rule the hearts of your subjects in india or you can openly consume beef). that is all i want to say., your ideological cohort group, the bajrang dal, has been openly >flashing weapons and imparting weapons training in the name of self-defence., it’s not about ideological family or anything, whoever promotes violence or flashes weapons publicly, i don’t support it. you can’t do this to instil fear in the minds of people. if somebody is doing self-defence training, then do it privately, not by exhibiting weapons publicly. there should be no flashing of weapons. it is the state government’s responsibility to stop it., >anand joshi, an mha under secretary, has been arrested and accused of pilfering files and corruption. how could that happen?, it was not just in our time, we are the ones who detected the theft. look at the ishrat jahan files, some are still untraceable. you should praise the government that we are so alert that nobody could take key files away., do the investigating agencies need reforms?, investigating agencies should get maximum autonomy. we don’t misuse agencies. we don’t try to politicise the system. there should be no political interference. i will give you an example. a file of the nia came to me, they wanted to send it for legal opinion to the law ministry. i asked officers: “why me?” if they want to seek a legal opinion, the nia should send it directly to the law ministry. the attorney general or sg, send it directly to them. i gave an order to that effect., did that file pertain to the >2008 malegaon case?

2016-07-13,"regain the peace, swiftly","once again jammu and kashmir is engulfed in tragedy. the death of a young militant, burhan wani, has given rise to violent protests across south kashmir. the 21-year-old had become an icon for radicals on the social media and reports of attendance at his funeral vary from 30,000 to 150,000. over 30 people have died in the past three days and hundreds have been injured, including policemen. kashmir is on the boil as it was six years earlier, and the governments in the state and the centre appear as unprepared as they were in 2010., this time, however, the two governments have responded more swiftly than in 2010. chief minister mehbooba mufti has begun a series of meetings with civil society groups and appealed to religious organisations and dissidents to help end the violence. her mlas have been directed to visit their constituencies. essential supplies are being rushed to the valley. union home minister rajnath singh has called two emergency meetings on the situation and the prime minister, national security adviser and home minister are monitoring it hour by hour. whether anyone in the two governments has spoken to the families of the civilians and policeman killed during the protests is unclear., need for restraint for the security forces the situation is more difficult. with few tools at hand, they need to exercise maximum restraint. protesters are setting fire to police stations and attacking security installations; the police are not in a position to deter them with effective barricades, tear gas or water cannon. the pellet guns that were acquired in 2010-11 as ‘non-lethal’ weapons are, when fired in proximity, lethal. given these shortfalls, it is unrealistic to expect that they will be able to ensure that there are no casualties, which means that the central and state governments need to take a very serious look at what other means they have to ensure that no more deaths or grievous injuries ensue., should the army work with the police forces to deter attacks through more effective barricades? or would such a step invite even greater protest? the army’s withdrawal to the barracks, leaving local security to the police, took several years to achieve and was an important step in security reform. unfortunately, with limited retraining or equipment for their new tasks and operating in a political and administrative vacuum, the police were hapless. it is worth exploring whether the army can undertake the limited role of advising and aiding the police forces to exercise maximum restraint, provided such a role would be restricted to the present situation alone., undoubtedly the most important step that can be taken is to seek public engagement in halting the cycle of protest-death/injury, as ms. mufti is now doing. but de-escalating public anger will take more than appeals. in 2010, the visit of an all-party parliamentary delegation and the subsequent appointment of a group of interlocutors, of which i was a member, began the thaw, but the absence of follow-up after our mission was completed in late 2011 soon vitiated the fragile peace that had been achieved., since then the state has witnessed successive waves of trouble, from natural disasters to intense cross-border shelling and displacement of people, to terrorist attacks and communal unrest. the failure to deliver by the peoples democratic party-bharatiya janata party (pdp-bjp) coalition that took office in 2014 compounded the situation, given that they had fought a bitter electoral contest. it was expected that they would reassure the electorate by choosing a grand gesture to implement their common minimum programme, but instead they were mired in controversy over article 370, the beef ban, sloganeering kashmiri students in the rest of india — these are all issues on which the two coalition partners were seen to be at loggerheads., discussion in parliamentthis is the context that the pdp-bjp government will have to overcome if it wishes to do more than contain the violence temporarily. prime minister narendra modi and chief minister mufti need to appear in sync with the pain of the bereaved and the anger of the valley. they have an upcoming opportunity — parliament will soon be in session and the situation in jammu and kashmir should surely be discussed, with mr. modi and ms. mufti briefing mps on necessary steps to be taken, especially outreach. an all-party mps’ delegation could be asked to visit the valley immediately and report to parliament. though there will be cynicism about such a visit, given that few of the mps followed up on their 2010 all-party visit, kashmiris will be open to reversing this opinion if there is follow-up this time., how serious the challenge will be is demonstrated by the fact that there was violence in kupwara and handwara in end april, just over two months ago, that public attendance at militant funerals has grown exponentially, that the state’s jamaat-e-islami has re-radicalised and that a new generation of kashmiri youth has taken to militancy (i include stone-pelters)., in the aftermath of the terrible deaths in 2010, the government did take steps to address challenges that were present then. the rangarajan committee’s recommendations resulted in a large number of training and employment programmes for kashmiri youth, but the programmes were implemented with so little knowledge or regard for the kashmiri cultural and political background that they proved to be a costly failure and, moreover, they actually increased the kashmiri sense of alienation exponentially.",-0.023727623727623725,"regain peace , swiftly","jammu kashmir engulfed tragedy. death young militant , burhan wani , given rise violent protests across south kashmir. 21-year-old become icon radicals social media reports attendance funeral vary 30,000 150,000. 30 people died past three days hundreds injured , including policemen. kashmir boil six years earlier , governments state centre appear unprepared 2010. , time , however , two governments responded swiftly 2010. chief minister mehbooba mufti begun series meetings civil society groups appealed religious organisations dissidents help end violence. mlas directed visit constituencies. essential supplies rushed valley. union home minister rajnath singh called two emergency meetings situation prime minister , national security adviser home minister monitoring hour hour. whether anyone two governments spoken families civilians policeman killed protests unclear. , need restraint security forces situation difficult. tools hand , need exercise maximum restraint. protesters setting fire police stations attacking security installations ; police position deter effective barricades , tear gas water cannon. pellet guns acquired 2010-11 ‘non-lethal ’ weapons , fired proximity , lethal. given shortfalls , unrealistic expect able ensure casualties , means central state governments need take serious look means ensure deaths grievous injuries ensue. , army work police forces deter attacks effective barricades ?

2016-07-15,it isn’t about women,"for nearly eight decades, the women’s movement has discussed and debated the desirability and feasibility of a uniform civil code, and has ended up posing a simple question — what is the value of uniformity? is it for the “integrity of the nation” that uniformity in laws is required, as some judicial pronouncements have suggested? if so, who exactly is the beneficiary? which sections of people benefit from “integrity of the nation”, that abstract entity which is not exactly at the top of your mind as your husband throws you out on the street?, or are uniform laws meant to ensure justice for women in marriage and inheritance? in that case, a uniform civil code would simply put together the best gender-just practices from all personal laws. so yes, polygamy and arbitrary divorce would be outlawed (a feature derived from hindu personal law). but conversely, as feminist legal activist flavia agnes has often pointed out, a uniform civil code would require the abolition of the hindu undivided family, a legal institution that gives tax benefits only to hindus, and all citizens of india would have to be governed by the largely gender-just indian succession act, 1925, currently applicable only to christians and parsis., a stick to beat muslims withmuslim personal law is already modern in this sense, since it has since the 1930s enshrined individual rights to property, unlike hindu law, in which the family’s natural condition is assumed to be “joint”. in the decades of the 1930s and 1940s, contrary to later discourses about muslim law being backward, it was hindu laws that were considered “backward” and needing to be brought into the modern world of individual property rights., again, since the muslim marriage as contract protects women better in case of divorce than the hindu marriage as sacrament, all marriages would have to be civil contracts. mehr, in muslim personal law, paid by the husband’s family to the wife upon marriage, is the exclusive property of the wife and it is hers upon divorce, offering her a protection hindu women do not have. so, the uniform civil code would make the practice of mehr compulsory for all while abolishing dowry., the patent absurdity of these suggestions arises not from the ideas themselves, but from the fact, recognised by everybody, that the talk of a “uniform civil code” has nothing to do at all with gender justice. it has entirely to do with a hindu nationalist agenda, and is right up there with the beef ban and the temple in ayodhya. a uniform civil code is meant to discipline muslims, teach them (if they didn’t know it already) that they are second-class citizens, and that they live at the mercy of “the national race” (the hindus), as m.s. golwalkar decreed., the real issue of gender justiceso let us pose the question differently — who suffers in the absence of a uniform civil code? is it muslim women, victims of polygamy and triple talaq, as hindutvavadi wisdom has it? but for decades, feminist legal practice has successfully used both the protection of women from domestic violence act, 2005 — that is available to all indian citizens regardless of religious identity — as well as the muslim women (protection of rights on divorce) act, 1986, to deal with polygamy and triple talaq, and to obtain maintenance, child custody and rights to matrimonial home for countless muslim women. in addition, feminist legal activists have used the landmark shamim ara v. state of u.p. (2002) ruling to buttress their claim that arbitrary triple talaq is invalid., moreover, polygamy is not exclusive to muslims. hindu men are polygamous too, except that because polygamy is legally banned in hindu law, subsequent wives have no legal standing and no protection under the law. under sharia law, on the contrary, subsequent wives have rights and husbands have obligations towards them. if gender justice is the value we espouse, rather than monogamy per se, we would be thinking about how to protect “wives” in the patriarchal institution of marriage. “wives” are produced through the institution of compulsory heterosexual marriage, the basis of which is the sexual division of labour. this institution is sustained by the productive and reproductive labour of women, and almost all women are exclusively trained to be wives alone., thus, when a marriage fails to fulfil its patriarchal promise of security in return for that labour, all that most women are left with is the capacity for unskilled labour. or they remain trapped in marriage with children to provide for, while men marry again, legally or otherwise, producing still more dependent, exploited wives and children for whom they take no responsibility. if gender justice is the point of legal reforms, the centrality and power of the compulsory heterosexual, patriarchal marriage, and the damage it can do to women, is what must be mitigated. this would mean recognising the reality of multiple “wives” as a common practice across communities, and the protection of the rights of all women in such relationships., in this sense, recent supreme court rulings that have granted rights to second wives in hindu marriages dilute the legal standing of monogamy for hindus but empower women., a survey conducted by the bharatiya muslim mahila andolan, a significant voice in the debate, found that more than 90 per cent of muslim women in india want a ban on “triple talaq” and polygamy in muslim personal law. that is, the demand is made within the framework of codifying muslim personal law, not in favour of a uniform civil code, partly because there is no clarity on what a uniform code would look like, but also because the demand comes from clearly hindutvavadi quarters which have shown that both women and minorities are expendable for them., lessons from the goa experiencethe only example of a uniform code in india is the portuguese civil procedure code (1939) of goa, which is neither ‘uniform’ nor gender-just. marriage laws differ for catholics and people of other faiths, and if a marriage is solemnised in church, then church law applies, permitting, for example, arbitrary annulment at the behest of one of the parties. the “customs and usages” of the hindus of goa are recognised, including “limited” polygamy for hindus., the positive aspect of goa’s civil code is the community property law, which guarantees each spouse 50 per cent of all assets owned and due to be inherited at the time of marriage. however, this provision can be sidestepped in practice, given the power relations in a marriage, and studies show that it has not made any impact on the incidence of domestic violence., clearly, if gender justice is not prioritised, both uniformity as well as its dilution can reinforce patriarchy and majoritarianism., the woman at the centre of this recent round of debate on the uniform civil code is shayara bano, who received talaq by post. her lawyer, instead of using any of the three recourses available discussed above — the protection of women from domestic violence act, 2005, the muslim women (protection of rights on divorce) act, 1986, or the citation of the shamim ara v. state of u.p. (2002) judgment — decided to file a public interest litigation in the supreme court challenging triple talaq on the grounds of violation of fundamental rights. ms. bano is now in the media spotlight, spiritedly criticising patriarchy in the muslim community.",0.09584009740259744,’ women,"nearly eight decades , women ’ movement discussed debated desirability feasibility uniform civil code , ended posing simple question — value uniformity ? “integrity nation ” uniformity laws required , judicial pronouncements suggested ? , exactly beneficiary ? sections people benefit “integrity nation ” , abstract entity exactly top mind husband throws street? , uniform laws meant ensure justice women marriage inheritance ? case , uniform civil code would simply put together best gender-just practices personal laws. yes , polygamy arbitrary divorce would outlawed ( feature derived hindu personal law ) . conversely , feminist legal activist flavia agnes often pointed , uniform civil code would require abolition hindu undivided family , legal institution gives tax benefits hindus , citizens india would governed largely gender-just indian succession act , 1925 , currently applicable christians parsis. , stick beat muslims withmuslim personal law already modern sense , since since 1930s enshrined individual rights property , unlike hindu law , family ’ natural condition assumed “joint ” . decades 1930s 1940s , contrary later discourses muslim law backward , hindu laws considered “backward ” needing brought modern world individual property rights. , , since muslim marriage contract protects women better case divorce hindu marriage sacrament , marriages would civil contracts. mehr , muslim personal law , paid husband ’ family wife upon marriage , exclusive property wife upon divorce , offering protection hindu women have. , uniform civil code would make practice mehr compulsory abolishing dowry. , patent absurdity suggestions arises ideas , fact , recognised everybody , talk “uniform civil code ” nothing gender justice. entirely hindu nationalist agenda , right beef ban temple ayodhya. uniform civil code meant discipline muslims , teach ( ’ know already ) second-class citizens , live mercy “the national race ” ( hindus ) , m.s. golwalkar decreed. , real issue gender justiceso let us pose question differently — suffers absence uniform civil code ? muslim women , victims polygamy triple talaq , hindutvavadi wisdom ? decades , feminist legal practice successfully used protection women domestic violence act , 2005 — available indian citizens regardless religious identity — well muslim women ( protection rights divorce ) act , 1986 , deal polygamy triple talaq , obtain maintenance , child custody rights matrimonial home countless muslim women. addition , feminist legal activists used landmark shamim ara v. state u.p.

2016-07-25,the charge of the cow brigade,"illustration: keshav | photo credit: keshav , one of my friends, who is an anthropologist, argues that the middle class indian does not need to be psychoanalysed on a couch. “a crowd,” he claims, “is a better method of analysing indian repressions.” india’s politics of anxiety emerges more at the level of the crowd. “crowds,” he adds, “are for negative democracy, the public for citizenship.”, for him, the psychology of india unravels at two levels. the first is at the level of the family, and where violence is more patriarchal. the second is at the level of an imaginary jajmani system — a socio-economic system more predominant in rural areas and of its interaction between the upper and the lower castes. in this caste bundle, there is constant shuffling which provides a sense of order and disorder. but the fact is that what looks like order at one level might be mayhem at the second level. for this he uses the example of the cow and the politics around it which are very much in the news. at the domestic level, the cow is a god and represents something sacred. simultaneously, it is the embodiment of an agricultural way of life. the cow is gau mata representing man’s oneness with nature and is embodied in his totemic relation with the animal., now, a symbol of social fissures but this domestic arrangement acquires political overtones. the nature of the symbol, the cow, changes and it soon comes to represent the worst in the caste system. the political battles around the cow soon become deep. let me put it this way. the cow expresses the social tensions within an agricultural society that is turning urban in its ways. here, local panchayats disrupt what is normal by becoming vigilantes. ironically, the cow becomes a symptom of the deep fissures within a society. brahmins, muslims and dalits are fast losing their moorings in agriculture and the cow becomes a source of violence. ironically the cow, instead of representing the best of agricultural values, embodies the tension between a changing caste system and the ideals of a constitutional india., as a result, we are soon inundated with images of and reports about social violence. in such moments of change, the constitution becomes an empty document. neither the rule of law nor law and order is maintained. vigilante groups play kangaroo courts while the rest of the nation can only watch. it is this sociology of violence that we must confront., one thing is clear. the government of india is blissfully deep in slumber as this process plays out. as victims protest the violence, the regime plays a game of being indifferent. i must add that i am not reporting one singular event but a cascade of events. as the urban social landscape flares up, one even begins wondering whether the much talked about smart cities of the future will have a civic place for the cow, even as imagination. given the nature of twitter and the internet, every act soon goes viral. events in even the remotest corners of the country soon become a global spectacle. they become a part of the ecology of everyday memory and are difficult to shrug off., it is not as if these “cow protection” groups protect the cow. they are not like the jain goshalas where there is deep respect for animal life and cattle are given shelter. these groups see little connection between the cow and the future of agriculture. in fact, the cow, which is an icon, honoured in festivals, and considered as a totem, becomes a symbol that leads to irrational violence. the high caste hindu, instead of seeking harmony between nature and culture in which the cow is cosmologically represented, now brutally disrupts both., minorities at the receiving end consider a typical scene that went viral. four men were stripped, tied to a car and beaten by a high caste group. the brutality of the scene is stark. what added to the brutality was the piety of the gau rakshak pretending he was protecting the ideals of a fading society. yet it is not as if the gau rakshak understands the jajmani system or the political economy of a society where lower castes carry away carcasses, playing a scavenging role that keeps other castes pure. the four dalits were taking away a dead cow to be skinned. this has been a part of tradition, yet the gau rakshak is illiterate about social functions. worse, these vigilante groups obtain encouragement from the rhetoric of government spokespersons who announce elaborate plans for cow protection. stopping illicit cattle trade between india and bangladesh is understandable, but using this as a pretext to inflict atrocities on dalits is not., such atrocities have been recurring with impunity and dalits are deeply frustrated. some have even gone to the extent of ending their lives., in all this, one realises that vigilante-sponsored violence is not sporadic but involves organised networks. they even patrol highways looking out for trucks ferrying cows and then attack those in the vehicle, using weapons to mete out instant justice. in turn, the centre remains silent, almost tacit in what it considers an informal validation of government policy. it is not sacred cows that the regime is protecting. what it is tacitly desacralising is the constitution. the so-called rights of a cow are getting precedence over the rights of dalits. the very sacred idea of a cow which seeks harmony between nature and culture now stands emasculated. it is here that fundamentalist movements get some of their energy from. it appears that the modi government is operating on split levels, with one entity suggesting modern proposals for policy, while the other wants all of this to be anchored to a fundamentalism. it is this which makes the violence so overt. oddly, the function of policing is being handed over to these groups and the regime sees them as arms that are helping to consolidate the ideology of the government., a structure of violence let me look at another incident which happened last year where >a 50-year-old man, mohammad akhlaq, was beaten to death and his 22-year-old son severely injured in dadri in uttar pradesh, allegedly by residents of bisara village, after rumours spread in the area about the family storing and consuming beef. in fact, if one looks at the lynching of akhlaq and the attack on the four dalit men for skinning a cow, one sees similarities. there is a third incident i will look at. this time it is on a video that emerged in late june this year which showed volunteers of the gau raksha dal forcing two “beef smugglers” to eat cow dung and drink cow urine. according to reports, their leader admitted that his group had forced the two muslim men to eat cow dung on june 10. the man claimed that volunteers, acting on a tip-off, intercepted a vehicle transporting “700 kg of beef from mewat to delhi” on the kundli-manesar-palwal expressway. he said the group chased the car for a few kilometres before stopping it near the badarpur border. “when we caught them, they had 700 kg of beef in their car. we made them eat panchgavya, a concoction of cow dung, cow urine, milk, curd and ghee, in order to teach them a lesson and also to purify them,” the man said. thus there seems to be adequate evidence of a new fundamentalist rule of law. the sad part is that the political opposition, especially the congress party, is reading all this as sporadic events rather than as an emerging structure of violence that does need to be confronted., we must understand that there is a style to the violence and its staging. in one way it is plain bully boy brutality, where brute majoritarianism seeks to make a point to some minority group, be it dalit, muslim or tribal and that “they must be taught a lesson”. vigilante and policeman literally mirror each other even as the government appears to be instructing the victims to be restrained!",-0.03291451218534552,charge

2016-08-06,cow vigilantes ‘anti-social’: modi breaks his silence,"breaking his silence on cow vigilantes in the country, prime minister narendra modi on saturday strongly condemned their actions, saying most of them were anti-social elements masquerading as gau rakshaks (cow protectors)., mr. modi asked the state governments to prepare a dossier on such “cow protectors”, while asserting that about 80 per cent of them would be found to be involved in illegal activities., “it makes me angry that people are running shops in the name of cow protection… some people indulge in anti-social activities at night, and in the day masquerade as cow protectors,” the prime minister said., need for compassionmr. modi, speaking at his first townhall-style address to mark the second anniversary of his government’s mygov initiative, said such volunteer groups were not meant to harass and oppress others. there is a need for compassion and an ability to sacrifice to do social service, he said., mr. modi’s comments come at a time when questions are being raised on his silence amid the spate of attacks, particularly in gujarat and uttar pradesh, on dalits, allegedly in the name of cow protection., there have been a series of violent protests in his home state demanding stern action against members of the vigilante group who brutally assaulted four dalit men., he pointed out that more cows were dying after consuming plastics than being slaughtered, adding that those wanting to serve them should work towards stopping the animals from eating plastics., he also said that while holding the prime minister responsible for everything that happens at the panchayat, gram panchayat, district and state level in the nation is good for politics and trps, it affects governance., “for good governance it is important that people responsible for tasks be held accountable… then there will be improvement.” he said., growth vital, economic growth of more than 8 per cent for 30 years will bring everything that is good in the world to india, mr modi said answering pre-recorded video questions posted on the mygov portal., talking about the national rurban mission, mr modi spoke about the plan to develop 300 villages across the country with infrastructure at par with cities and launched the slogan, “aatma gaaon ki, suvidha sheher ki” (soul of the villages, facilities of the city)., india first, to a question on his foreign policy, mr modi said “india first” was his focus point, alongside protecting the country’s economic and strategic interests.",0.08535353535353536,cow vigilantes ‘anti-social ’ : modi breaks silence,"breaking silence cow vigilantes country , prime minister narendra modi saturday strongly condemned actions , saying anti-social elements masquerading gau rakshaks ( cow protectors ) . , mr. modi asked state governments prepare dossier “cow protectors ” , asserting 80 per cent would found involved illegal activities. , “it makes angry people running shops name cow protection … people indulge anti-social activities night , day masquerade cow protectors , ” prime minister said. , need compassionmr. modi , speaking first townhall-style address mark second anniversary government ’ mygov initiative , said volunteer groups meant harass oppress others. need compassion ability sacrifice social service , said. , mr. modi ’ comments come time questions raised silence amid spate attacks , particularly gujarat uttar pradesh , dalits , allegedly name cow protection. , series violent protests home state demanding stern action members vigilante group brutally assaulted four dalit men. , pointed cows dying consuming plastics slaughtered , adding wanting serve work towards stopping animals eating plastics. , also said holding prime minister responsible everything happens panchayat , gram panchayat , district state level nation good politics trps , affects governance. , “for good governance important people responsible tasks held accountable … improvement. ” said. , growth vital , economic growth 8 per cent 30 years bring everything good world india , mr modi said answering pre-recorded video questions posted mygov portal. , talking national rurban mission , mr modi spoke plan develop 300 villages across country infrastructure par cities launched slogan , “aatma gaaon ki , suvidha sheher ki ” ( soul villages , facilities city ) . , india first , question foreign policy , mr modi said “india first ” focus point , alongside protecting country ’ economic strategic interests .","{'bjp': 0, 'cong': 0}",0,0
2016-08-09,lessons in prevarication,"the issue, however, is not whether the so-called protectors are genuine or fake. the issue is that the agenda of cow protection has been, since the 1880s, embedded in communal imaginaries, positioning of non-hindus as the other, and communal rioting between hindus and muslims.illustration: deepak harichandan , it is too early to make reasoned evaluations of narendra modi’s career as the prime minister of india. but of one thing we are certain: mr. modi is a consummate politician. one of the qualities of a skilled politician is the ability to prevaricate and run verbal circles around current political predicaments. accomplished politicians simply refuse to be pinned down; they manage to slide through difficult questions with some practised ease. it is precisely prevarication that characterises the prime minister’s speeches on the rare occasions that he interacts with the media., the political and the personal in a 2013 reuters interview,> mr. modi was asked to respond to the 2002 communal riots in gujarat. his answer was in keeping with his consistent refusal to regret the macabre killings and sordid mutilations that marked the riot. he adroitly circumvented the deeply political character of communal violence, and sought refuge in the domain of personal emotions. “if someone else is driving a car and we’re sitting behind, even then if a puppy comes under the wheel, will it be painful or not? of course it is,” he responded. note that the personal is not the political, the personal remained the personal, and the political remained unaddressed. “india’s narendra modi,” stated a headline in the washington post of july 12, 2013, “lets politics go to the dogs”. in a lighter vein, a number of observers wondered why mr. modi, who steers politics and economics single-handedly towards the precise goals he sets, was sitting in the back seat of the said car., the same sort of equivocation characterise >his comments on saturday and sunday on ‘cow vigilantes’ who freely torture, whip and kill muslim cattle traders, and dalits whose hereditary occupation is the skinning of dead cattle. the prime minister termed such people “fake cow protectors”, as anti-social elements, and as people who bring the presumably noble act of cow protection into disrepute. this “gau rakshak” business, he said, makes him angry. once again, his response to a deeply political act, that of serious violations of the constitutional right to dignity and bodily integrity, is phrased in terms of personal emotions. mr. modi is a man who has a flair for the political, and yet he skilfully dodges the political nature of crimes committed by ‘cow protectors’., the question that should be asked and answered is: why are acts of intimidation, coercion, extortion, brutality and plain bullying clothed in the fig leaf of cow protection at this precise moment in political time? we do not have to go very far to look for an answer. the party in power at the centre and in some states has put all its energies in selectively choosing and implementing one of the directive principles of state policy on offer, article 48, which enjoins the state to preserve and protect cattle. the project of saving the cow so ardently pursued by hindutva cadres and bharatiya janata party (bjp) leaders provides enough immunity to those who violate constitutional rights to life and dignity. bjp politicians openly issue fatwas condemning entire families, which just might have consumed beef, to corporeal punishment. cow vigilantes sit in judgment on infringements of the project, lynch women, muslims and dalits, and string up ‘errant’ men on tree branches. and police forces that should be bringing vigilantism to book provide a shield for criminals., the prime minister suggests that people who carry out these horrific acts are not genuine cow protectors. he is right. recently a television news channel exposed the rank mercenary motives of criminals who assault truck drivers ferrying cattle in western india, threaten and extract protection money from owners of cattle, and profit monetarily by arbitrarily confiscating cows that belong to others. whether fake or real, cow protection has become big business for many, and poses a serious threat to the lives and liberties of others., history of cow politics the issue, however, is not whether the so-called protectors are genuine or fake. the issue is that the agenda of cow protection has been, since the 1880s, embedded in communal imaginaries, positioning of non-hindus as the other, and communal rioting between hindus and muslims. the history of movements for the protection of cows in india is a sordid one. it has nothing to do with religion. this history recounts two overlapping tales of cynical politics. the first tale is that of unifying a deeply divided and hierarchically ordered hindu community under the banner of cow protection. whether the so-called lower castes, who not only consume beef but are also fated to skin dead cows, bought into this upper-caste agenda is still a matter of debate among historians. but the project, fashioned by cultural entrepreneurs and innovators in late 19th century north india, succeeded in achieving the second objective, that of identifying and metaphorically crucifying muslims as beef-eaters, and as killers of cattle particularly during the festival of bakr-i-id., the cow protection movement told us one tale of unifying a caste-ridden society, and of expanding the constituency of right-wing politics to the countryside. the second tale relates to the different ways in which the constituency of indians was divided and fragmented by the symbolic body of the holy cow. expectedly, both tales constructed muslims as the other. the process treaded a well-worn path: the collective self is invariably defined in opposition to a manufactured ‘enemy’ with whom there can be neither truck nor transaction., the cow protection movement in the 1880s followed three sorts of strategies to achieve its twin objectives. one, a number of cow protection associations were set up throughout india. swami dayanand saraswati, the founder of the arya samaj, travelled across the northern part of the country to establish gau rakshak societies. two, he and his followers mobilised public opinion on the issue through distribution of pamphlets and speeches. three, arya samajists collected thousands of signatures and attached them to petitions addressed to the colonial government. these petitions implored the government of india to ban cow slaughter. the outcome of these efforts could be foretold. leaders of the muslim community reacted indignantly, and in 1893 a number of riots between hindus and muslims broke out in bombay, punjab, uttar pradesh, bengal and other parts of north india right up to rangoon, and right up to the middle of the 20th century., because cow protection had become a politically significant issue, it was taken up in the constituent assembly. a provision for the protection of cattle was incorporated in the directive principles of state policy. in the 1960s, a major movement

2016-08-15,what it means to be independent,"the independence that we celebrate today was won by the indian people through a prolonged and hard struggle of epic dimensions, a larger-than-life battle in which ordinary men and women performed heroic roles. it was the culmination of a revolutionary movement which forced the rulers of an empire on which the ‘sun never set’ to surrender power to their ‘subjects’ whom they had exploited for over two centuries. it heralded the beginning of the end of colonialism, a process still called decolonisation by western academia, to give it the appearance of a voluntary withdrawal. india was the first colony to throw off the imperial yoke, and its example inspired other countries in asia and africa, and by the early 1960s, most countries had become independent. the indian national movement had supported the struggle of all colonised people, and after independence the new indian state under jawaharlal nehru’s leadership continued to do so. the non-aligned movement was part of this effort to give the newly independent countries an opportunity to keep out of the cold war and the two power blocs and assert their independent voice without having to parrot the views of a hegemon., nature of indian nationalismthis raises the question about the nature and character of >indian nationalism, which did not seek to promote indian interests at the expense of others, did not seek to dominate smaller powers, instead supported and encouraged them to be independent. this was because indian nationalism, as articulated in our freedom struggle, was a progressive, revolutionary, humane, compassionate, pro-people, anti-colonial nationalism. it was not the aggressive jingoistic nationalism of the fascist mussolini or nazi hitler which was used in europe in the 1930s and 1940s to crush democracy, and commit genocide on bona fide citizens by declaring them anti-national. neither was it the homogenising nationalism based on language (and often religion), as in 19th century europe, examples being french-speaking catholic france and german-speaking protestant germany. the nationalist vision that inspired millions of indians was of an independent, multi-lingual, multi-religious, secular, democratic, civil libertarian and egalitarian republic., the >hyper-nationalism> witnessed in india in recent times is not the nationalism of our freedom struggle. it misuses nationalism, which has a positive connotation in the minds and hearts of the indian people, to polarise, to divide, and to suppress individual freedoms. how can this be the genuine article? our nationalism is meant to unite, to harmonise, to guarantee freedom of speech, freedom of the press, freedom of association. i particularly want to draw attention to the issue of civil liberties, as this is one of the strongest elements in the legacy of the freedom struggle which is under grave threat today. witness the reckless use of section >124-a to charge students with sedition, with vigilantes attacking even journalists inside law courts, with books being withdrawn and pulped, with ministers attempting to terrorise dissenting intellectuals by labelling them as ‘intellectual terrorists’, with gau rakshaks physically attacking those who they think are flouting their diktats, especially if they belong to the >dalit or minority communities. these attacks on freedom of expression, of movement, on freedom to eat and earn your livelihood, bring home to us the urgent necessity of resisting these attacks, and that can only be done by defending civil liberties, by defending this legacy as an integral part of our nationalism, and by declaring these attacks as anti-national. to do so, we need to arm ourselves with greater knowledge about how the battle for civil liberties was linked to our national struggle. i offer some examples below., in fact, the leaders of the freedom struggle believed so strongly in the absolute right to freedom of expression, including freedom of the press, that they considered the struggle for these civil liberties to be an essential part of the national movement. almost half a century before anti-imperialist nationalist ideas begun to emerge, >raja rammohan roy, often called the father of modern india, as early as 1824 protested against a regulation restricting the freedom of the press. in a memorandum to the supreme court, he argued for “the unrestricted liberty of publication” to ensure that every individual could bring his views to the notice of the rulers., power of the pressmuch before the formation of the indian national congress or other nationalist organisations, nationalist ideas were expressed and spread through the medium of the press, and that too mostly the indian language or vernacular press. most of these were papers started by middle class people of nationalist leanings who invested their life’s savings and often their family jewellery in this enterprise. incensed by the highly critical tone adopted by the press against the administration for their inhuman attitude towards the victims of the famine of 1876-77, the viceroy, lord lytton, decided to strike hard. a draconian law aimed at the indian language newspapers was planned in secrecy and passed in a single sitting of the imperial legislative council. the infamous >vernacular press act 1878, provided for the confiscation of the printing press, paper, and other materials of a newspaper if the government thought that it was publishing seditious material., it was well known that the newspaper that had most raised the hackles of the government was the amrita bazar patrika, published by the brothers sisir ghosh and motilal ghosh from calcutta in bengali and english, and the plan was to take action against it under the new act. imagine the state of british officialdom when they woke up the morning after the passing of the act to find that the amrita bazar patrika had converted itself overnight into a purely english language newspaper, thus placing itself outside the purview of the act., strong protests broke out against the new act all over the country. the press itself played a leading part in this campaign. the first big demonstration on a matter of public importance was held at the town hall in calcutta. it is a matter of great significance that the nationalist forces, even before they were formally organised, won a major victory, and that too on the issue of civil liberties. in 1881, in deference to strong public opinion, the viceroy lord ripon repealed the vernacular press act. so this legacy is almost a century and four decades old!, a few years later, in 1883, surendranath banerjea, one of the founders of the movement for independence, was sent to jail for two months for contempt of court for an editorial he wrote in his newspaper, the bengalee, criticising a judgment of the calcutta high court in sharp terms. this was seen by political india as an attack on civil liberties. in calcutta, there was a complete hartal in the indian part of the city. students demonstrations outside the high court turned violent and stones were thrown at the police and windows smashed. among the demonstrators was a future vice-chancellor of calcutta university, ashutosh mukherjee. demonstrations and meetings in support of banerjea were held in cities as far away as lahore, agra, amritsar, and poona. in calcutta were held many open air mass meetings, a form of protest and expression that was to become the staple and defining feature of the indian struggle for freedom., similarly, and on a far bigger scale, country-wide protests followed when lokmanya tilak was sentenced to 18 months’ rigorous imprisonment in 1897 for publishing his own speech in the kesari, his marathi newspaper. again, in 1908, tilak was convicted of sedition under the notorious section 124-a of the indian penal code and sentenced to transportation for six years and exiled to mandalay in burma for his articles on ‘the arrival of the bomb’. the reaction was predictably stronger, given the timing of the attack, at the last phase of the swadeshi movement. markets in bombay were closed for a week, workers went on strike in textile mills and railway workshops, and it took the army and 16 workers dead to force them back to work., in 1922, mahatma gandhi was also tried under the same section 124-a for sedition for articles he wrote in young india, and the judge told him he was giving him the same punishment that was given to lokmanya tilak: six years of imprisonment, but not in exile. the struggle for civil liberties thus entailed much suffering and sacrifice, many suffered long jail terms, others lost their life’s savings, their families paid the cost; the legacy is thereby a precious and hallowed one. a legacy which we cannot allow to be whittled away, as on its defence rests our ability to defend the humane, pluralistic and egalitarian legacy of indian

2016-08-16,a journey for liberty,"marching for equality: “if the movement generated by the yatra does liberate dalits in the region and also provides meaningful jobs, there will be a silent bloodless revolution.” the dalit asmita yatra in una, gujarat. , ‘jai bhim’ and ‘azadi, azadi’ are the two signature slogans of the >dalit asmita yatra from ahmedabad to una that culminated in a massive rally on august 15., there were several unique features of this yatra. it was spontaneous, with a publicly stated non-violent approach. it had no political affiliation. ordinary people supported it in large numbers, with meetings held in villages en route where local participation was spontaneous. there were no celebrity leaders or speakers. undertaken on a shoestring budget, it had several groups coming together — trade unions, dalit sangharsh samitis, workers’ unions, youth groups and individuals. participants came from all over india and dalit leaders from punjab, bihar, andhra pradesh and telangana joined in., the yatra was an immediate response to recent repeated attacks on dalits. in rajula, a dalit man and his non-dalit wife were killed. in another village, a dalit boy was burnt alive. on july 11, four dalit youth were stripped, >tied to a car and beaten for hours in public in front of the una police chowki for allegedly skinning a cow. the public outrage ultimately led to a rare speech by the prime minister on the issue. over 30 dalits either committed suicide or attempted it. buses were stoned and the gujarat state road transport corporation cancelled services to the region., on the revolutionary road the government did not leave anything to chance. a couple of buses with state reserve police personnel accompanied the yatra from ahmedabad. the yatris were well received in every village by local people. the speeches were remarkably sober with no rabble-rousing. each meeting had a public pledge that no one would henceforth skin dead cows or other animals. there was a demand for land from the government. a procession was taken around each village. people of other castes watched the yatra with curiosity. the group solidarity was an enormous confidence-booster for the local dalits. the peaceful, non-violent yatra was all the more remarkable given the background of inhuman and humiliating incidents., however, another set of discussions took place in private without the mike. the women complained of daily humiliation. they have to take their own glasses for tea as no dhaba will offer them theirs. they cannot dip their vessels in the wells to draw water. if some other woman touches them by mistake, she washes her hands. if their family refuses to skin dead animals, they face the wrath of the local elites. if they perform the skinning, they face the >brutality of the gau rakshaks. they live in an atmosphere of fear, they said. they want to be free of discrimination. are we not human beings like everyone else and doesn’t the same blood flow in our veins, they asked. what stood out was the steady voice they spoke in without anger or resentment. they want simple justice, not revenge., the younger men are keen to get jobs as many are now educated at least up to high school. the older men want land which not only provides agricultural income but is the one asset that confers social status. none brought up the topic of the atrocities they suffer. they said they do not want to fight with anybody. there was fear among the locals about what would happen after the yatra. would there be a backlash?, the well-educated leaders of the yatra do not hold the same opinion. they quote babasaheb ambedkar and discuss the roots and nuances of the >caste system. they want a complete change and say so openly. they don't agree with mahatma gandhi or the communists or the well-meaning urban liberals. however, these are intellectual disagreements and no barrier to working together. the severe exclusion practised against dalits by hinduism convinces them that there is no good in the religion. the ordinary hindu, who may even sympathise with the cause, feels a bit of reform is enough. but the dalit cannot imagine any good coming from hinduism. our society has to find a way of bridging this gulf, the deepest in india, without being patronising. public apology by the gurus and custodians of hinduism and a clear denunciation of discrimination, saying it is anti-hindu, may be a good beginning., towards meaningful change the dalit leaders of the yatra understand that the so-called ordinary rural local dalit is not ready for a fight. but they talk of the myriad day-to-day experiences of exclusion and discrimination they live through. one of them challenged an upper-caste man to change his last name to a dalit one for six months and live in a rural or working class setting. “the expression on the other person’s face changes when you mention your very name. live with a name like that and then you will understand what it means to be a dalit.”, in the leaders’ view, change requires a multi-pronged approach that includes material, social and psychological progress. while the first two are heard about, it is revealing to hear of the ‘superiority complex’ of the upper castes that is reflected in the feelings of inferiority among the dalits. if society looks down on you all the time you cannot develop to your full human potential, they said. they asked a simple question to the well-meaning outsiders: “you come here and give advice that dalits should be clean, well behaved, study hard and so on. are dalits mere objects for reform? but who will clean the prejudice from the minds of the upper castes?”, the atmosphere during the course of the yatra was charged but in a silent way. once, false rumours spread at night that the yatris were insulting other people. some roads to una were blocked. police intervention was required., some important questions remain. will this >dalit asmita yatra mark the beginning of a new set of social changes? will it spread to other states? will there be new alignments and a lasting political fallout?, the region in gujarat from rajula to una is isolated. beyond that you see factories, highway restaurants, elite schools, the ubiquitous cows on excellent highways, and several huge 30-foot trucks transporting industrial goods. but in this stretch you see terrible roads, poor communications, and very little signs of luxury or even prosperity. locals say feudalism is strong here.",0.04498344123344122,journey liberty,"marching equality : “if movement

2016-08-24,it’s mayawati versus modi in u.p.,"in a january 2015 opinion piece in the hindu titled ‘when the elephant disappears’, sanjay kumar and pranav gupta argued that the mayawati-led bahujan samaj party (bsp) was hurtling downhill to the benefit of narendra modi’s bharatiya janata party (bjp). the authors said that in the 2014 lok sabha election, the bsp had lost votes across castes but the final blow was the migration of a sizeable section of the party’s core voters, dalits, to the bjp. in conclusion they asked: “circa 2015, we could ask, what is happening to the bsp and where is mayawati in mainstream politics?”, though late by 19 months, the answer to the whereabouts of ms. mayawati might have finally come. newly resurgent and riding the tailwinds of a dalit uprising located primarily in gujarat but rapidly resonating with dalit masses around the country, the bsp chief is currently in home ground u.p., rolling up her sleeves for an all-knives-out showdown in the upcoming assembly election. her party, which until recently shunned publicity, preferring to work silently on the ground, has upped its public profile and burst on the social media landscape, tweeting short, crisp messages and forming mutually reinforcing links across dalit social media groups., a reverse ram mandir momentms. mayawati herself has been something of a spitfire, a form not seen since her 2014 rout. her aggression in parliament over the dayashankar singh incident (the bjp functionary had likened her to a prostitute) was apparently only the beginning: her cadre invaded the streets swearing vengeance and justice, recalling the early war-like years of the bsp. at that precise point surfaced a gut-wracking video that captured in graphic detail a violent upper caste attack on dalit cow skinners in una in gujarat. against a backdrop of daily atrocities on them, dalits’ retaliation to the una horror was on a scale beyond anybody’s imagination. the revolt shattered the unstated assumption that dalits were too habituated to their subjugation and placement in the hindu caste order to want out of it. just where una will eventually take dalits is still to be seen but from today’s perspective it has all the appearance of an inflection point, somewhat like a reverse ram mandir moment., the frenzy that united the upper and lower castes in favour of the bjp made ayodhya a turning point in india’s political history. it was a dalit who laid the first stone at the 1989 shilanyas (foundation) ceremony for the intended ram temple, signalling the start of the bjp’s social engineering project. the dalit co-option was a message to the world outside, especially to potential allies, that the bjp was a serious political player with a caste outreach extending beyond its often ridiculed brahmin-bania base. it would be many years before the bjp’s future partners accepted the party but when they eventually did, the spin-off was fantastic: the bjp pole-vaulted from the margins to the thick of power politics, and subsequently to government formation at the centre., yet thanks to the hindu orientation of the bjp, which made entrenched caste hierarchies almost impossible to break, the party’s social co-option experiment has succeeded only on and off. seen once as the definitive symbols of the bjp’s inclusive politics, backward caste leaders such as kalyan singh and uma bharti invariably found themselves getting the short shrift in a party patently torn between its upper caste heart and backward caste mind. more often than not, it was the heart that won., narendra modi’s arrival in 2014 appeared to have once and for all ended this internal social tension. on the campaign trail in u.p., mr. modi flaunted his obc antecedents even as he spoke the idiom of modernity and development. surprisingly, the paradox worked to his advantage: marginalised backward and dalit castes saw their own advancement in mr. modi’s rise from caste and class disadvantage to presumptive prime minister. as a.k. verma noted in a september 2014 article in economic and political weekly (“development and governance trump caste identities in uttar pradesh”), in u.p., the bjp gained across castes in the 2014 election, but most spectacularly, it broke through the bsp’s dalit citadel. mr. verma said the bsp’s jatav support was down 16 points to 68 per cent, and in the case of other dalit castes, down 35 points to 29 per cent. the bulk of this loss, he said, was captured by the bjp., my own travels in u.p. during the 2014 election suggested that jatavs, who form around 55 per cent of dalits in u.p., and who have been ms. mayawati’s mainstay, largely stuck with her firstly because the bsp chief is herself jatav, and secondly because of the sense of security they derived from her leadership. this loyalty and kinship did not apply to other scheduled castes who more readily embraced mr. modi. but overall, there was no denying that a chunk of ms. mayawati’s dalit vote had shifted to mr. modi. as counting ended, the bsp was left with no seat for a pitiful vote share of 19.62 per cent., the modi factorpost the 2014 election, the bsp and the bjp presented stunningly contrasting pictures. up until 2007, the bsp had dominated the bjp. it aligned thrice with the hindutva party — in 1995, 1997 and 2002-2003, and each time gained at the expense of its partner. this amazing run climaxed in an awe-inspiring majority for the bsp in the 2007 assembly election. as the bsp rose, the bjp sank: its tally in the assembly dropped from 174 seats in 1996 to 88 seats in 2002. in 2007, the bjp crashed to 51 assembly seats. in the lok sabha, the bjp declined from 52 seats in 1996 to 10 seats in 2004. the party finished last among major players in the 2009 lok sabha election., mr. modi’s coming comprehensively reversed the scene. if the future prime minister turned the bjp’s u.p. deficit into a humongous surplus, winning 71 lok sabha seats for a vote share of 42.3 per cent, it was the bsp’s turn to meet a calamitous end., by any yardstick, the bjp’s 2014 margin should be unbeatable, most so in fragmented u.p., where parties have wrested majorities on a vote share of 30 per cent. and yet, the una outrage and the revolt it has engendered have infused in ms. mayawati a confidence out of proportion to her current electoral standing, and emboldened her to frontally confront and challenge the bjp goliath., in the two years since 2014, the bsp had started to rebuild itself, egged on by feedback of a fresh churn on the ground and voter recall of ms. mayawati as an administrator with iron control on law and order — a big plus point given u.p.’s current status as a lawless, ever boiling communal cauldron. the bsp had no incumbency burden unlike the ruling samajwadi party (sp) while mr. modi was perceived to have fallen widely short of the promises he made on the stump., around may this year, the modi-amit shah think tank resurfaced with what looked like a foolproof plan to erase the last vestige of ms. mayawati’s dalit support. unfortunately for the bsp chief, this onslaught coincided with the exit from her party of leaders of repute and standing. everything was going wrong for the bsp, and it seemed inevitable that the modi-shah combine would mount the final assault. their dalit outreach plan was elaborate and included minute booth-level management, indoctrination through buddhist monks and dining at dalit households. the prime minister sounded the election bugle on june 13 with a huge rally in allahabad, and also on the cards was a dalit-specific public rally in agra to be addressed on july 31 by mr. shah, the bjp president., as they say, the best-laid plan can fall apart, and una hit the bjp like a thunderbolt. embarrassed, mr. shah cancelled the agra meeting — and to his mortification, ms. mayawati addressed a rally at the same place on august 21, drawing an estimated crowd of nearly one lakh. unsurprisingly, the bsp chief used the opportunity to slash at mr. modi. the incumbent sp did get thrown a few punches but it was clear who ms. mayawati saw as her rival and who she was getting back at. the bsp chief recalled each one of mr. modi’s 2014 promises and accused him of betraying voters, and worse, of not being able to contain the orgy of violence against dalits and muslims., the dalit-muslim alignmentthe bottom line that emerged from the rally was dalit-muslim unity. it has been apparent for a while now that if the bsp has to recover lost ground, it has to go back to the drawing board and do two things: bring the ‘bahujan’ back into the reckoning and form an alliance with muslims. the bsp has had a troubled history with muslims primarily because of a perceived incompatibility between dalits and muslims. yet if una showed anything, it is that they are both victims of a similar oppression. when the bsp chief went to ahmedabad to commiserate with the una victims, she pointedly mentioned the gau rakshak attacks on muslims. the bsp’s twitter handle now goes with the hashtag, #dalitmuslimunity.",0.06859762055074554,’ mayawati versus modi u.p .,"january

2016-10-17,kairana and the politics of exclusion,"161017 -oped -nhrc illustration: keshav , for over three years now communal politics has been on the upswing in uttar pradesh. with assembly elections due in early 2017, the communal pot has been stirred up again in this crucial state. ever since the bharatiya janata party (bjp) came to power at the centre, polarisation on issues such as ‘love jihad’, ‘ghar wapsi’ and the beef ban have become a regular feature of political mobilisation in uttar pradesh and the country at large. the urge to engage in a politics of polarisation must be understood in the context of the muzaffarnagar violence of 2013, which worked to the party’s benefit in the 2014 lok sabha election. its impact can be seen from the fact that bjp leaders who were implicated in the violence were given tickets and they won their seats with large margins. for the first time, not a single muslim candidate was elected to parliament from the state even though muslims constitute over 19 per cent of its population and over 30 per cent of the population in quite a few districts of western uttar pradesh. , in june, the bjp’s lok sabha member of parliament hukum singh released a list of 346 members of hindu families that had allegedly fled kairana town in shamli district of western uttar pradesh due to persecution and pressure fearing atrocities at the hands of muslim criminals and extortionists. (the chief complainant is an accused in the 2013 muzaffarnagar violence.) bjp president amit shah called the allegations of a hindu exodus an ‘eye opener’ at a public rally in allahabad, and he later cautioned that “up should not take kairana lightly”. aligarh’s bjp mp satish gautam declared that there is a need to find out about “other kairanas”. it is clear from these statements that the ruling party is not averse to using the issue as a plank for political mobilisation even though it could aggravate social tensions in the region., however, the forced exodus claim was denied by the state government and the district administration. several investigative reports by the media, notably in the hindu, the indian express, hindustan times and quint, also exposed these claims. they found it to be exaggerated and false as many of the people had migrated for various reasons and some had done so in search of better opportunities. in short, the kairana exodus was dismissed as a non-event until it was revived by the national human rights commission (nhrc). in response to a complaint filed by monika arora, a supreme court advocate, and a vocal and active member of the bjp, the commission constituted a team from its investigation division to look into the complaints of exodus of hindu families from kairana due to fear of criminals. , the nhrc report released on september 21 observed that these allegations are ‘serious’ and that several hindu families have migrated because of the worsening law and order situation after victims of the muzaffarnagar riots settled there. it stated that: “in 2013, the post-rehabilitation scenario resulting in resettlement of about 25/30 thousand members of muslim community in kairana town from district muzaffarnagar, up, the demography of kairana town has changed in favour of the muslim community becoming the more dominating and majority community. most of the witnesses examined and victims feel that the rehabilitation in 2013 has permanently changed the social situation in kairana town and has led to further deterioration of law and order situation.” , the report came to this conclusion on the basis of verification of six victims/persons and telephonic verification of members of four displaced families in three randomly selected residential localities, which makes it a total of 10 out of the 346 cases of migration from kairana for reasons of insecurity. , overall, the nhrc report provides no substantive authentication of its controversial findings; furthermore, it provides no details of the total number of families who migrated from kairana, the specific time frame for when these families left and the exact reasons behind their decision to do so. the five-page report comprises brief statements on the criminal incidents given by select witnesses. there is no evidence in the report that these crimes were committed by displaced people who had settled in kairana, even though the report asserts that the presence of muzaffarnagar riot victims has changed the demography of kairana and this has led to a further deterioration of law and order in the town. this is a conjecture, not a fact; there is no factual evidence to establish a connection between the presence of internally displaced persons and the increase in incidents of crime mentioned in the report. in any case, there is no corroboration to back the figure of 25-30,000 muslim victims having settled in the town. , the impression conveyed by the report that only members of the majority community are impacted by the faltering law and order situation in western uttar pradesh is deeply flawed. the attempt to paint a largely criminal phenomenon with a broad communal brush without citing any independent and credible evidence is surprising from an institution mandated to investigate human rights violations. sure enough, the labelling and stigmatising of the minority community in this manner has dismayed civil society activists and victims of the muzaffarnagar violence who have demanded a withdrawal of the ‘partisan and prejudiced’ report. social activist farah naqvi, who has been working for the rehabilitation of the people displaced by the muzaffarnagar riots since 2013, called the nhrc report nothing more than “communal rumour-mongering”. , the 2013 communal violence had initially displaced over 75,000 people. a 2016 report, living apart: communal violence and forced displacement in muzaffarnagar and shamli, based on detailed ground-level research done by the non-governmental organisations aman biradari and afkar india, found 50,000 people still scattered all over muzaffarnagar, shamli and other districts, of whom nearly 30,000 victims were in 65 internally displaced people colonies. according to the report, 270 families (approximately 2,000 people) had settled in kairana. it found that even after three years, riot victims are living in ghetto-like resettlement colonies with little support from the state administration. it further notes that the uttar pradesh administration not only failed to rehabilitate riot victims displaced from their homes and villages, it also actively encouraged muslim refugees, who used to live in hindu majority villages, to resettle in muslim-majority colonies, thus escalating the social divide., curiously, the large-scale displacement caused by communal violence in 2013 did not lead to any investigation or recommendations by the nhrc. but the commission saw it fit to investigate the exodus of 346 people, and what’s more, recommend the formation of a high-level committee of the government of u.p. “to meet each of the displaced families from kairana town now living in districts dehradun, panipat, muzaffarnagar, roorki, karnal, etc. of uttarakhand and haryana in order to redress their grievances and facilitate their return to kairana, if so desired…” it did not make the same proposals for the rehabilitation of over 75,000 people displaced from muzaffarnagar in 2013.",0.025662726786322292,kairana politics exclusion,"161017 -oped -nhrc illustration : keshav , three years communal politics upswing uttar pradesh. assembly elections due early 2017 , communal pot stirred crucial state. ever since bharatiya janata party ( bjp ) came power centre , polarisation issues ‘love jihad ’ , ‘ghar wapsi ’ beef ban become regular feature political mobilisation uttar pradesh country large. urge engage politics polarisation must understood context muzaffarnagar violence 2013 , worked party ’ benefit 2014 lok sabha election. impact seen fact bjp leaders implicated violence given tickets seats large margins. first time , single muslim candidate elected parliament state even though muslims constitute 19 per cent population 30 per cent population quite districts western uttar pradesh. , june , bjp ’ lok sabha member parliament hukum singh released list 346 members hindu families allegedly fled kairana town shamli district western uttar pradesh due persecution pressure fearing atrocities hands muslim criminals extortionists.

progressive movements towards justice or rhetorical acts which reveal deeper paranoid fears that we need to confront., our romeo vs shakespeare’s, first, a word about our romeo. the shakespearean romeo evokes tragedy, misunderstanding, a poignancy, but the story rises to the heights of the tragedy. our local romeo is more a character out of charles lamb, a banalised nukkad rowdy. in fact, he is very reminiscent of the rowdy as created by law. the british, in fact, created two kinds of lawbreakers, at two ends of the spectrum. the first was the thug targeted by lord william bentinck., the rowdy, a regular character in movies with bulging biceps, a handkerchief around his neck, was as much a victim, a local bully and gangster who lived on and off the streets. mr. adityanath’s romeo is the rowdy of romance, the local eve-teaser. he has little to do with literature and less with romance. in fact, the anti-romeo act reveals that this law is selective, and secondly, it reveals more about the fears of mr. adityanath rather than the fears of women in the city., second, the anti-rowdy project is a part of a wider programme. one has to see it as part of ‘ghar wapsi’ and love jihad. anti-romeo is part of the yogi’s campaign. the anti-muslim bias is obvious in the first two. in the third, a secular cover tells hindus and muslims not to mix too freely. they will now be seen as law or order issues. the local nuisance is raised to the height of villainy and disposed of. the rashtriya swayamsevak sangh is pretending to soothe local fears and settle political scores. in justifying it, local leaders have said that romance should be a drawing room affair and not a spectacle on the streets. implicit in it are two assumptions. romance should have parental approval, and it should be restricted to the same community., there is a humourless quality to the whole affair. when prashant bhushan suggested that krishna may not have been so lucky if mr. adityanath had lived in mythical times, the bajrang dal and other hindutva groups immediately protested. it is clear that our gods have a sense of humour, of love, of fun and frolic that mr. adityanath and his ilk lack. one wonders why the threat of the bajrang dal is not seen as a threat to rights or to law and order. one senses krishna might be having a chuckle at the antics of his so-called loyalists., a creeping paranoia, what one witnesses here is a paranoia extending to daily life. it is almost as if the idea of security is one word which is extending from the frontiers of the nation state to the daily lives of the people, guarding boundaries at the national and ethnic level. in fact, security has become the new myth that the ideology of the bjp/rss/bajrang dal/shiv sena is enforcing. it is based on hate, paranoia and suspicion and it allows for only one interpretation. religious narratives such as the ramayan allowed for hundreds of variants which the adityanaths and bajrang dal would be the first to ban., what one is witnessing is not an attempt to tackle the so-called lumpen elements of a city, seen by the middle class as perpetual threats to law and order. instead of tackling the lumpen elements with a framework of rights, i am afraid what is happening is what i call the lumpenisation of the law. earlier, relations between boy and girl, especially from different communities, would be tackled vigilante style. now, vigilantism is being justified as an act of governance. in fact, even fundamentalism becomes an act of governance or law and order. the affability and plurality of hinduism loses out to the puritanism of hindutva. one is watching not the emergence of an anti-romeo but anti-human rights group., every law must have a mirror-like double. the idea of the double brings out the parallelism between two phenomena where inversions bring out similarities. what the anti-romeo did for gender, the cow slaughter ban does for the link between nature and culture. what mr. adityanath was threatening, gujarat chief minister vijay rupani has already articulated in the assembly, a vision of a shakahari state, where vegetarianism evokes truth and morality. the great dream is to demand closure of all meat shops., in a sociological sense, fundamentalism about food can be as lethal as fundamentalism about sex. it is not only the question of morality. it is also a question of diversity, and diversity requires a variety of food habits where diversity of crops, food, myth and religion sustain a pluralism of culture. within each group, food habits can be uniform, but diversity demands difference as the soul of culture, while mr. adityanath demands uniformity., in the name of the cow, it is not as if the ban on cow slaughter is an ode to the cow. the cow in fact becomes a strangely ambivalent creature. in the bjp state, the cow is more a fact of culture than of nature. what we have is an urban society living off its agricultural nostalgia. in fact, violence to food is a deeper topic, of the aggressive use of hormones, cruelty to animals, the ethics of biotechnology, none of which is even addressed by mr. adityanath. what we are witnessing is a substitutability of violence to the muslim and the dalit in the name of the cow, as evident most recently from the attack in alwar on muslim men transporting cows.",0.05764610389610391,"eat , pray ,

2017-04-14,courting faith and reason ,"the challenger space shuttle exploded in 1986, killing all seven crew members. it occurred because of a design flaw in the rocket boosters of the spacecraft. the u.s. national aeronautics and space administration (nasa) had sub-contracted the design of the boosters to an independent company. the company had noticed that the putty used to seal rings on the boosters was forming bubbles that caused a heat jet so hot that it could burn through the rings. the engineers changed the putty. they knew that a putty erosion could still occur, but with very low probability of a catastrophic disaster. unfortunately for the seven who perished, in a series of small steps nasa deviated from its safety standards and determined that the erosion of the putty was an acceptable risk of flight., later, nasa commissioned many inquiries into the cause of the disaster. the most insightful report came from diane vaughan, then a teacher of sociology at boston college, who attributed the disaster to what she called a “normalisation of deviance”. the phrase meant that “people within the organisation become so much accustomed to a deviant behaviour that they don't consider it as deviant, despite the fact that they far exceed their own rules for the elementary safety”., today on b.r. ambedkar’s 126th birth anniversary, violence over cow slaughter threatens to rend apart the republic and his magnificent constitution which gave us a secular country with a fundamental right to life and liberty assured to every citizen. how did the body politic slowly deviate so much so that a man’s choice of meat has become his poison? it is time to recount ambedkar’s normalisation of deviance in the constituent assembly on the question of cow protection. that deviance emboldened the supreme court decades later to take a position that would have been an abomination to men like ambedkar., in 1948 ambedkar published his book the untouchables: who were they and why they became untouchables? he wrote: “in the first place, we have the fact that the untouchables or the main communities which compose them eat the dead cow and those who eat the dead cow are tainted with untouchability and no others. the co-relation between untouchability and the use of the dead cow is so great and so close that the thesis that it is the root of untouchability seems to be incontrovertible. in the second place if there is anything that separates the untouchables from the hindus, it is beef-eating.” he went on to say: “the reason why broken men only became untouchables was because in addition to being buddhists they retained their habit of beef-eating which gave additional ground for offence to the brahmins to carry their new-found love and reverence to the cow to its logical conclusion.”, however, in the constituent assembly debates around the same time, ambedkar was not as vocal against ‘cow reverers’. in february 1948, the first draft of the constitution was placed before the assembly. it contained no reference to cow slaughter. the cow protection brigade within the assembly pushed for an amendment seeking for cow protection as a fundamental right. ambedkar and his team of draftsmen came up with a constitutional compromise., a directive principle, seemingly based on economic and scientific grounds, was allowed to be introduced by pandit thakurdas bhargava, a prosperous brahmin lawyer from hisar. it read: “the state shall endeavour to organise agriculture and animal husbandry on modern and scientific lines and shall, in particular, take steps for preserving and improving the breeds, and prohibiting the slaughter, of cows and calves and other milch and draught cattle.”, despite his political stance outside the constituent assembly, within it ambedkar said nothing substantial in the debates on cow slaughter, only that he accepted bhargava’s amendment. bhargava, however, emphasised his reluctant acceptance of the compromise when he said, “… for people like me and those that do not agree with the view of ambedkar and others, this entails, in a way, a sort of sacrifice.”, another cow proponent, seth govind das, amplified ambedkar’s lawyerly thinking in the matter. “i had then stated that just as the practice of untouchability was going to be declared an offence so also we should declare the slaughter of cows to be an offence. but it was said that while untouchability directly affected human beings, the slaughter of cows affected the life of animals only and that as fundamental rights were for human beings, this provision could not be included therein.”, thus, though expressed in terms of economic policy, underlying this agreed amendment was the assembly’s covert yielding, in a limited measure, to hindu sentiments of cow protection. protection ostensibly was restricted to cows and calves, milch cattle and those cattle capable of pulling heavy loads.",0.05635593220338982,courting faith reason,"challenger space shuttle exploded 1986 , killing seven crew members. occurred design flaw rocket boosters spacecraft. u.s. national aeronautics space administration ( nasa ) sub-contracted design boosters independent company. company noticed putty used seal rings boosters forming bubbles caused heat jet hot could burn rings. engineers changed putty. knew putty erosion could still occur , low probability catastrophic disaster. unfortunately seven perished , series small steps nasa deviated safety standards determined erosion putty acceptable risk flight. , later , nasa commissioned many inquiries cause disaster. insightful report came diane vaughan , teacher sociology boston college , attributed disaster called “normalisation deviance ” . phrase meant “people within organisation become much accustomed deviant behaviour ' consider deviant , despite fact far exceed rules elementary safety ” . , today b.r. ambedkar ’ 126th birth anniversary , violence cow slaughter threatens rend apart republic magnificent constitution gave us secular country fundamental right life liberty assured every citizen. body politic slowly deviate much man ’ choice meat become poison ?

2017-05-09,don’t take my cell phone away!,"if there was one thing i regularly relied on while commuting by bus to college in mumbai in the late 1980s, it was the brass knuckleduster in my bag. with that around, i felt pretty invincible. when a man tried to rub against me, just slipping my fingers into it made me feel powerful. on about three occasions, i actually used it to jab a persistent harasser., those days, safety pins, hairpins, umbrellas, were the objects carried around by young women to ward off street sexual assault. these days, the weapon of choice for most women is the mobile phone. when why loiter conducts gender and public space workshops and asks young women to open handbags and “take out the one thing that you rely on to keep you safe in public”, this is the item that is most pulled out of the bag. the exercise is intended to demonstrate that in the absence of reliable state or institutional provisions for safety, individual women strategise and produce safety for themselves in a multitude of ways. increasingly, across the class spectrum, they seem to use mobile phones to help them in that endeavour., all this came to mind when one recently heard about a panchayat near mathura announcing a fine of ₹21,000 for women caught using mobile phones in public. apparently, for a woman there to use a cell phone is a ‘crime’ equivalent to drinking, gambling and cow slaughter. this is not the first time mobile phones have been banned for women in ruralised india. last year, villages in mehsana and banaskantha districts (gujarat) imposed a ban on unmarried women possessing a mobile phone. several village councils in rajasthan, haryana and bihar have imposed similar restrictions. three years ago, villages in muzaffarnagar (up) banned women simultaneously from using mobile phones and wearing jeans – apparently both were signs of degenerate ‘western’ morals that incite violence against them., the ban against young women using mobile phones is presented as a way of keeping them ‘safe’. but the safety constructed here is less about providing real protection to women from non-consensual attacks and more about preventing women from setting up consensual everyday sojourns (or in the extreme, elopements) with ‘inappropriate men’ via the cell phone. that is keeping women safe from their own desires and choices., most women living in indian cities find these tirades against mobile phones not just ridiculous but extremely problematic, considering they today use the cell phone in many different ways to manufacture safe everyday access to the public.",0.12653985507246376,’ take cell phone away !,"one thing regularly relied commuting bus college mumbai late 1980s , brass knuckleduster bag. around , felt pretty invincible. man tried rub , slipping fingers made feel powerful. three occasions , actually used jab persistent harasser. , days , safety pins , hairpins , umbrellas , objects carried around young women ward street sexual assault. days , weapon choice women mobile phone. loiter conducts gender public space workshops asks young women open handbags “take one thing rely keep safe public ” , item pulled bag. exercise intended demonstrate absence reliable state institutional provisions safety , individual women strategise produce safety multitude ways. increasingly , across class spectrum , seem use mobile phones help endeavour. , came mind one recently heard panchayat near mathura announcing fine ₹ 21,000 women caught using mobile phones public. apparently , woman use cell phone ‘crime ’ equivalent drinking , gambling cow slaughter. first time mobile phones banned women ruralised india. last year , villages mehsana banaskantha districts ( gujarat ) imposed ban unmarried women possessing mobile phone. several village councils rajasthan , haryana bihar imposed similar restrictions. three years ago , villages muzaffarnagar ( ) banned women simultaneously using mobile phones wearing jeans – apparently signs degenerate ‘western ’ morals incite violence them. , ban young women using mobile phones presented way keeping ‘safe ’ . safety constructed less providing real protection women non-consensual attacks preventing women setting consensual everyday sojourns ( extreme , elopements ) ‘inappropriate men ’ via cell phone. keeping women safe desires choices. , women living indian cities find tirades mobile phones ridiculous extremely problematic , considering today use cell phone many different ways manufacture safe everyday access public .","{'bjp': 0, 'cong': 0}",0,0
2017-05-27,antidotes to the mad cow disease,"promising anita dube and devika daulet-singh. , no, no, don’t let the headline give you a wrong idea. i won’t be discussing cow rakshaks and cow bhakshaks here. the temptation, i confess, is strong. nothing like fantasising about a good beef curry to get your gonads working. also, the indian cowboys are an exciting kettle of fish as they are not cowed down by minor irritants like the law or the constitution and such. their vigilantism is ever ready to rise up in violent defence of mother india and mother cow., a pragmatic side of me wonders why we need a standing army at all; aren’t gau rakshaks enough? they are fierce, committed, bloodthirsty and a law unto themselves. they’ve almost perfected the art of lynching all comers on the streets. they won’t resort to cowardly tactics like using civilians as human shields. no geneva convention or other protocols of war apply to them. why, not even rules of our own country apply to them. they will lynch a few ‘enemy’ soldiers at the border and bring the rest grovelling to their knees. withdraw the army and para-military from the borders and despatch battalions of rakshaks from the cow-belt and see how our border security profile jumps up., the mad cow disease was triggered by cows in the u.k. being fed their own offal. there are many such parallels we could find here. for one, when the cow rakshaks were fed with yogi adityanath as their chief minister. this was toxic fodder which, in turn, made the rakshaks super-toxic, triggering an entire chain of post-modern violence by pre-modern goon squads., succession question, so this column is in the nature of a reflection around appropriate leadership and the passing on of institutional mantles in a responsible manner, which would enable the institutions to grow. when the ‘dhongi’ of u.p. was allocated the chief ministership, it helped put the already criminalised police constabulary there on hold, to be replaced by vigilante street mobs who enjoy the kind of enviable immunity that even afspa does not grant the army., it’s against such a background of criminal succession in politics that i wish to examine two exemplary instances of enlightened succession from the world of the arts. the first is the inspired choice, end-march, of delhi-based artist anita dube (59) as curator of the 2018 edition of the kochi-muziris biennale. and the second is the equally stunning choice, end-april, of delhi-based photography expert devika daulet-singh (45) as curator of the 2018 edition of the chennai photo biennale. , , these are two amazing appointments that the media doesn’t even seem to know how to celebrate and seems to have largely bypassed. one even feels like adding that the degree of crudity in the indian media today is directly proportional to its ignorance and disinterest in cultural and artistic matters., dube is an artist-intellectual in the true sense of the word. as a prominent founding member (along with the politically charged k.p. krishnakumar) of the short-lived, if charismatic and hugely influential, indian radical painters and sculptors association, she has remained at the forefront of challenging commercial tendencies in indian art practice. the group, which came together in baroda in 1987, created a bit of a flutter as it frontally questioned what it described as the market-friendly ‘figurative’ work of the already distinct ‘baroda school’, which included, among others, formidable artists/ intellectuals such as gulam sheikh, bhupen khakhar, vivan sundaram, nalini malani, geeta kapur, sudhir patwardhan and jogen choudhury. , feminist contexts, as the manifesto writer for the group’s ‘questions and dialogues’ exhibition, dube robustly put forward the idea of working with ‘social memory’ through found objects, fragments and industrial material. when the group was disbanded prematurely following the tragic death of krishnakumar, its members scattered and dube herself moved towards creating artworks with a distinct political/ feminist content. some of the pieces she wrote for me a quarter of a century ago when i used to edit the arts pages of the economic times still retain an urgent immediacy. , as co-founder (along with pooja sood) of the khoj artists initiative in delhi, dube has stayed at the cutting edge of contemporary indian art practice, which careens dangerously between flatness, dimension and volume (or, in other words, painting, sculpture and installation) with photography adding another magical layer. one looks forward to the assured artistic and theoretical legacy she will bring to bear upon the kochi biennale and the marks of her unique signature as the first female curator of any indian biennale., daulet-singh too has raised the bar high for photo practices in india, including making pictures, printing, mounting and exhibiting them, and finally compiling and publishing them. after graduating with a bfa in photography from the rhode island school of design, she started out quietly by setting up the photo agency photoink, in 2001.

2017-06-01,cow slaughter and the constitution,"over the last few days, the central government’s new prevention of cruelty to animals (regulation of livestock market) rules have run into strong headwinds. these rules, which effectively prohibit the sale of cows and buffaloes for slaughter at animal markets, and are therefore perceived as imposing an indirect beef ban, have been the subject of protests in kerala and tamil nadu, and have drawn strong condemnation from west bengal chief minister mamata banerjee. with the madras high court on tuesday staying the rules for four weeks, the battle has swiftly moved to the court as well. and with this, apart from the political turmoil, legal and constitutional fault lines have also been reopened, causing much uncertainty about what the outcome will be., this dispute has a history, which goes back to the founding of the republic. during the framing of the constitution, the subject of cow slaughter was one of the most fraught and contentious topics of debate. seth govind das, a member of the constituent assembly, framed it as a “civilisational problem from the time of lord krishna”, and called for the prohibition of cow slaughter to be made part of the constitution’s chapter on fundamental rights, on a par with the prohibition of untouchability. in this, he was supported by other members of the constituent assembly,

of the constitution) carefully excluded the question of religious sentiments. nor did it require the state to ban cow slaughter outright. instead, under the heading “organisation of agriculture and

“express itself clearly and definitely”, so that muslims could know exactly what the position was on cow slaughter. however, clear and definite expression on the issue of cow slaughter was one thing that the assembly was unwilling to commit to. article 48, a provision that was grafted out of a compromise that left nobody satisfied, came into being with the rest of the constitution, on january 26, 1950., the fundamental disingenuousness that underlay article 48 was to be repeated, many times over, in constitutional litigation before the supreme court. right from 1958, the supreme court was asked to adjudicate upon the constitutional validity of cattle slaughter bans passed by various states. petitioners before the court argued that a prohibition of cow slaughter violated their rights to trade and business, and also their right to freedom of religion. the supreme court rejected these arguments and upheld the laws, but it did so by focussing its reasoning entirely on — apparent — economic considerations. detailed analyses of agricultural output and milch yields give these judgments a strained, almost unreal quality. much like the drafting committee, it was as if the court was unwilling to admit — and to uphold — the possibility of non-economic considerations behind such laws, as though this would shatter the thin facade of secularism to which the constitution remained (ostensibly) committed., the disingenuousness that marked the constituent assembly debates, that was written into final text of article 48, and that has been inscribed into 50 years of the supreme

1960 law, the prevention of cruelty to animals act, as its justification., however, the supreme court’s order makes no mention of cattle slaughter, and a reading of the act demonstrates clearly that it does not contemplate prohibiting animal slaughter per se. not only does it specifically exempt slaughter of animals for food, it also provides for advice on the design of slaughterhouses, so that “unnecessary pain or suffering, whether physical or mental, is eliminated in the pre-slaughter stages as far as possible.”, now, under our legal and constitutional system, an executive notification

2017-06-01,cow slaughter and the constitution,"over the last few days, the central government’s new prevention of cruelty to animals (regulation of livestock market) rules have run into strong headwinds. these rules, which effectively prohibit the sale of cows and buffaloes for slaughter at animal markets, and are therefore perceived as imposing an indirect beef ban, have been the subject of protests in kerala and tamil nadu, and have drawn strong condemnation from west bengal chief minister mamata banerjee. with the madras high court on tuesday staying the rules for four weeks, the battle has swiftly moved to the court as well. and with this, apart from the political turmoil, legal and constitutional fault lines have also been reopened, causing much uncertainty about what the outcome will be., this dispute has a history, which goes back to the founding of the republic. during the framing of the constitution, the subject of cow slaughter was one of the most fraught and contentious topics of debate. seth govind das, a member of the constituent assembly, framed it as a “civilisational problem from the time of lord krishna”, and called for the prohibition of cow slaughter to be made part of the constitution’s chapter on fundamental rights, on a par with the prohibition of untouchability. in this, he was supported by other members of the constituent assembly, such as shibban lal saksena, thakur das bhargava, ramnarayan singh, ram sahai, raghu vira, r.v. dhulekar and chaudhari ranbir singh. proponents of a cow slaughter ban advanced a mix of cultural and

2017-06-27,p.n. bhagwati's legacy: a controversial inheritance,"justice p.n. bhagwati, who died recently, at 95, is perhaps the most influential judge independent india has had. what indira gandhi is to indian politics, justice bhagwati is to the indian judiciary: their legacies have endured, having engineered a populist democratisation based on radical rhetoric, but at very heavy costs to the institutions themselves., one can see strong resonances of mrs gandhi’s style in the modi government’s mode of functioning in their all or nothing friend or enemy view of politics, with complete disregard for the autonomy of institutions. similarly, with contemporary standards of judicial behaviour, pronouncements pandering to the lowest common denominator — calling for the cow to be declared the national animal, imposing the national anthem on cinema-goers and imposing thoughtless prohibition near national highways — while simultaneously displaying pusillanimity in institutionally vital cases against the central government such as aadhaar, the money bill and the delhi government cases. the very condition of possibility of such playing fast and loose with the law are justice bhagwati’s landmark interventions., just as nationalism has now emerged as the currency of contemporary judicial populism, socialist rhetoric was his path to power. he was appointed to the supreme court in 1973 at the height of mrs gandhi’s ideological onslaught on the judiciary, with her call for a ‘committed judiciary’. the kesavananda bharati judgment had recently been delivered, in which the supreme court had dared to stand up to mrs gandhi and had declared the constitution’s basic structure as un-amendable even by her brute parliamentary majority. in the aftermath of this judgment she superseded the three senior-most majority judges leading to their resignations, and appointed bhagwati and krishna iyer to the supreme court., also reada unique blend of judicial virtues , a unique blend of judicial virtues, two key points deployed in mrs gandhi’s mid-1970s attack on the judiciary were the inaccessibility of the legal system and its alien british form. the responses were also twofold: the expansion of legal aid and the injection of indigeneity in legal institutions, respectively. legal aid was even declared part of the emergency’s flagship twenty point programme. the two recent judicial appointees, justices krishna iyer and bhagwati, enthusiastically responded and penned successive reports proposing ‘nyaya panchayats’ as the silver bullet solution to both the problems. the challenge of democratising access to courts could have been met through an expansion of legal aid. instead the solution was seen as creating parallel informal institutions, diluting judicial procedure by short-circuiting basic principles of adjudication. these visions of paternalistic deprofessionalised indigenous justice provided the basis for future developments such as lok adalats at the lowest level, tribunalisation at the intermediate level and public interest litigation (pil) at the highest level of the judiciary. for the part they played in this process, professor upendra baxi later wrote that the two judges “remain vulnerable to the charge of acts as legitimators of the emergency regime”., justice bhagwati soon proved his loyalty to the emergency regime much more directly: as part of the majority in adm jabalpur vs shivkant shukla, which upheld the constitutionality of the draconian maintenance of internal security act (misa), and declared that even the right to habeas corpus would not survive during the emergency. justice bhagwati was justly targeted for his role during the emergency after the 1977 elections. he soon moved to the other extreme, and proved his loyalty to the janata government by upholding its use of article 356 against congress-led legislative assemblies, a decision with disastrous consequences for indian federalism. he did another somersault after mrs gandhi returned to power in 1980. he was the only judge in the minerva mills case to uphold her emergency era amendment immunising any statute implementing a directive principle from judicial review for violating articles 14 and 19, thus giving primacy to directive principles over fundamental rights. accordingly, a statute implementing prohibition, or prohibiting cow slaughter, or introducing uniform civil code, or pursuing ‘socialism’ would be immune to judicial challenge for violating the rights to equality and freedom. if this sounds rather familiar, it is because the indian judiciary has implicitly followed the logic of justice bhagwati’s dissenting opinion in recent years. in the judges’ transfer case, he went on to explicitly support the appointment of judges based on their ideological predilections, i.e., court packing for a ‘committed judiciary’. when the constitutionality of the national security act, 1980, mrs gandhi’s successor statute to misa, was challenged, he got another chance to somewhat undo the notoriety of the habeas corpus case, but he upheld this law as well. in spite of such an appalling record on civil liberties and such open servility to regimes in power, how did justice bhagwati acquire such a heroic reputation?",0.05694739686542966,p.n. bhagwati ' legacy : controversial inheritance,"justice p.n. bhagwati , died

2017-07-05,the terrorisms we overlook,"over a century ago, an indian subject living in london wrote a pamphlet that was to become a rallying point for india’s nationalists. dadabhai naoroji’s poverty and un-british rule in india was not merely an indictment of economic imperialism but also served to call the bluff on the claim that the british empire was necessary to ensure fairness in the governance of an india misgoverned by its native rulers., his suggestion was that british rule in india could hardly be deemed fair if it was associated with a drain of wealth engineered by the colonial state. two sets of events that have taken place in india recently point to a state that continues to remain at odds with the aspirations of most indians. both involve death of our fellow citizens in which the state is implicated at least indirectly. that the state can be so placed leaves us to ponder the democracy we actually have. only, unlike naoroji’s salvo against the colonial state, today we would want to engage with ours in order to ensure that it is fit for a democracy., most of us seem to have an idea of what we mean when we utter ‘the t-word’. it unambiguously refers to attempts to destabilise if not actually destroy india from the outside. it is this conception of terrorism that the prime minister employed when, on his most recent trip to the united states, he teamed up with its president to declare a commitment to fight global terrorism. we may query the wisdom of aligning india with a united states whose historical role vis-à-vis terrorism is dubious. u.s. foreign policy incubated the taliban, which spread terror in the name of islam, and rained terror on iraqi children in the name of keeping the world safe from weapons of mass destruction. however, it cannot be doubted that india faces the threat of terror from outside its borders. ‘26/11’ is only the most egregious instance of this. then, armed thugs had gone about massacring innocent indians in public spaces in mumbai. to characterise, as some do, the horror this had evoked across the country as some reactionary nationalism is to miss the threat such terror holds out to the ‘idea of india’, at its core a vision of diverse people living in harmony., india though is also besieged by terrorism emanating from within its borders, and this needs to be addressed with at least as much urgency as that which prime minister narendra modi brings to the issue of the external threat to india. two forms of this may be earmarked, one more recent and highly visible and the other centuries old and honed to perfection. ending both would require addressing how the machinery of government functions here., over the past two years or so we have seen a rising tide of violence, mainly in northern india, against dalits and muslims. this has revolved around the treatment of the cow. indians have been physically attacked by rampaging mobs accusing them of storing beef or transporting cows for slaughter. upon this excuse, dalits have been assaulted and muslims actually killed. finally, on june 28, aroused citizens across the country gathered to protest against this violence under the banner ‘not in my name’. it is the most significant protest against intolerance that we have witnessed so far and appears to have had success, for the very next day the prime minister remarked in a speech made at the sabarmati ashram in ahmedabad that individuals had no right to kill in the name of gau bhakti. he had gone on to add that mahatma gandhi would not have approved of their action., surely the latter is a little naïve in that the gau rakshaks represent a strand of thought that believes gandhi emasculated hinduism in whose name they themselves now act. the prime minister’s response to the terrorising of dalits in gujarat and the killing of muslims across north india is far too weak in relation to the negation of democracy that this violence represents. it is expected of government to protect citizens from assault by fascist forces and he should mobilise the government machinery to do so. that law and order is a state subject is not an excuse and in any case most of this violence is taking place in states ruled by the bharatiya janata party. it is clear that the civil administration code in india sufficiently empowers the district-governing authority to deal with the situations related to mob lynching. as vigilantism, often enacted while the police stand by watching, is completely unacceptable in a democracy, one would expect the government to outline in parliament what it intends to do to eliminate it., meanwhile in southern india, we have a glimpse of the indian state in an avatar different from that of a passive observer of murder. it is one of those in charge of its levers using their position in ways that can cause the death of citizens. in kerala in late june, a farmer was found hanging within the premises of a village office in kozhikode district. piecing together entries in a suicide note and the statements of relatives and neighbours, we know the following: for some time the farmer, kavilpurayidathil joy, had been trying to pay the taxes due on his land. the village office was refusing to accept it. for him, evidence of taxes paid was the proof required to either pledge or sell his land, which he needed to do quite urgently in order to repay debt., one version is that the village office was unable to accept the tax as the title to the land itself was under dispute, the property being forest land, thus rendering the private possession of it illegal. but this account makes a mockery of the fact that tax on the same property had been accepted earlier. an interpretation of the stance of the representatives of the state, who constitute the village office, is that the farmer was being harassed for a bribe in return for their registering the payment. this account gains credibility when considered along with the public’s perception that the revenue department in kerala is among its most corrupt. note that the farmer did not go quietly and in despair. he chose to hang himself in the premises of the village office to register his protest at the injustice meted out to him by the state. an almost similar incident had occurred only weeks before in the state’s south when a woman, frustrated in her attempts to have a property transfer acknowledged by the authorities, attempted to immolate herself in a government office.",0.043854875283446684,terrorisms overlook,"century ago , indian subject living london wrote

2017-10-17, a dangerous proposition,"prime minister narendra modi deserves our appreciation for repeatedly assuring the nation that for him, the only holy book is the constitution. it seems the rashtriya swayamsevak sangh and the prime minister do not see eye to eye on this subject, as the rss was not happy with the constitution from the beginning. the rss chief, mohan bhagwat, recently said in hyderabad that our legal system should be based on “the ethos of society”. sangh ideologue k.n. govindacharya has openly spoken of how the constitution needs to be rewritten. , in all such utterances, the agenda of review too is clear — remove individualism, secularism, socialism; dilute parliamentary democracy and civil liberties; and give more prominence to fundamental duties rather than to fundamental rights, and so on. true, our constitution is a bag of borrowed ideas, but borrowing a few western ideas is not necessarily bad if such ideas have some value and relevance for us., why repeal the constitution?, no one generation has a monopoly on wisdom. humans are fallible but do learn from experience and thus must be empowered to change the constitution as per the exigencies of time. amendments are good if they reflect the evolution and maturity of constitutional democracy. why does the rss appear to be more interested in a new constitution rather than mere amendments? a 13-judge bench of the supreme court in the kesavananda bharati case (1973) laid down that the basic structure of the constitution cannot be altered in exercise of constituent powers of parliament to amend the constitution; thus repeal of the constitution is the only option for the extreme right. this is indeed a dangerous prospect., it is instructive therefore to understand at what point of time a nation drafts a constitution. this is usually when there is a break from the past, such as independence from a colonial power, partition of the country or merger of the country, or a revolution. none of this has really happened, and therefore there is no occasion to draft a new constitution. a constitution sets the agenda for the future. it should look forward, not backward. learning from the past is good, but glorifying the past with a desire to revive past values is nothing but fundamentalism., the indian constitution has incorporated the promises that the indian national congress had made to the people of india in the struggle for independence. all those ideals are reflected in the constitution. many of our leaders had gone to western countries and studied the concepts of liberty and individualism. they were convinced that these concepts have a universal application. , individualism is the central theme of most fundamental rights. sangh ideologues seek the removal of the centrality of individualism from the constitution in the name of family and collective or group rights. just because individualism is a western idea does not make it bad. the india of today is entirely different from ancient india., fundamental rights and fundamental duties are not co-relative. like other liberal democracies we do not believe in the theory of rights and duties being co-relative. even indira gandhi during the emergency could not make them co-relative. thus fundamental duties were inserted by the 42nd amendment in the non-binding directive principles chapter rather than in the justiciable fundamental rights chapter. autocratic regimes are always more interested in duties rather than rights. , similarly, saying that the constitution was not originally secular or socialist is wrong. these terms were inserted in 1976 to make explicit what was already implicit in the constitution. in 1973 itself the supreme court considered secularism to be part of the constitution’s basic structure. the preamble and fundamental rights clearly made us a religion-neutral state. similarly, our preamble and directive principles were already tilted in favour of socialism. article 39 has explicitly said there shall be no concentration of wealth, and national resources are to be distributed so as to subserve the common good. but only two directive principles — cow slaughter and uniform civil code — are debated day in and day out., minority rights were another subject on which we were clear. from the beginning. in fact, after partition, there has been significant dilution of those rights. the apex court has repeatedly held that these rights too are part of the basic structure and cannot and must not be tampered with.",0.03206198893698893,dangerous proposition,"prime minister narendra modi deserves appreciation repeatedly assuring nation , holy book constitution. seems rashtriya swayamsevak sangh prime minister see eye eye subject , rss happy constitution beginning. rss chief , mohan bhagwat , recently said hyderabad legal system based “the ethos society ” . sangh ideologue k.n. govindacharya openly spoken constitution needs rewritten. , utterances , agenda review clear — remove individualism , secularism , socialism ; dilute parliamentary democracy civil liberties ; give prominence fundamental duties rather fundamental rights , on. true , constitution bag borrowed ideas , borrowing western ideas necessarily bad ideas value relevance us. , repeal constitution?

2018-03-10,adversity to advantage: on bjp's strategy,"tripura, until recently unused to anyone fussing over it, has suddenly transformed into a fortune-teller of india’s politics and politicians. the narendra modi-led bharatiya janata party’s superlative victory in the election to the tripura assembly has, overnight as if, shifted the spotlight from the failings of the national democratic alliance government to the modi-amit shah team’s strategic brilliance and recurring ability to come out on top., on the other hand, the congress, which had appeared to be in revival mode, has begun to be written off once again. with its vote base shifting almost en masse to the bjp, the congress won no seats in tripura, which was in fact why the manik sarkar-led left front government was defeated. this setback, in turn, has pushed the congress out of the reckoning for leading a united opposition. congress president rahul gandhi, who chose verdict day to visit his grandmother in italy, to much mirthful trolling by twitterati, has reverted to his former and seemingly default status of an ad hoc leader. the faint interest the regional parties had begun to show in mr. gandhi has passed and they have moved on to the familiar trope of forming a non-bjp, non-congress third front., the tripura turn, can so much turn on a verdict delivered by one little state? tripura’s past elections have barely got a mention in the media. mr. sarkar was expected to win and he did. the opposition was expected to lose and it did. the twist in the story comes from the bjp, with almost no vote in the state, pole vaulting to a 43% vote share — more than 50% with its regional ally — to pull off a stunning victory. this wasn’t the only shock and awe moment, though. the bjp went on to form a government in nagaland and also in meghalaya, where it won only two seats. in themselves the bjp’s northeast manoeuvres may be insignificant for estimating its 2019 prospects. their importance lies in demonstrating the bjp’s killer instinct and all-out will to power., a little flashback is necessary here. clouds of pessimism had hung over the modi government in the days before the elections in the three northeastern states. if 2017 closed with the bjp’s barely-won victory in gujarat, the new year brought even less cheer. the party lost critical by-elections in rajasthan and madhya pradesh to the congress and critics and admirers alike despaired at the state of the economy, seen to have been driven to the ground by the double whammy of demonetisation and a mishandled goods and services tax (gst). it was notable that the bjp did not fare well in the rural areas of gujarat, and farmer protests in different states underlined the extent of rural debt and distress. a lokniti-csds opinion poll indicated that overall satisfaction with the government had declined from 64% in may 2017 to 51% in january 2018., the december-january period also saw frenzied protests by the karni sena which wanted the film padmavat banned for allegedly trifling with rajput sentiments. the scale of violence and the tacit support offered to the sena by sections of the bjp discomfited many even among mr. modi’s legion of admirers. unlike the spate of lynchings by gau rakshaks and attacks on young hindu-muslim couples and dalits across much of north and west india, which the bjp and its followers blamed on fringe elements, there was no way to defend the spectre of bjp-run state governments scurrying to obey the diktats of the lawless sena. the collapse of administration in these states was chillingly brought home when hoodlums attacked a school bus carrying children in gurugram. the image the bjp conveyed as theatres were vandalised and pictures flashed of children cowering in fright, was of a party condoning violence only to appease its vote bank., disenchantment, barely had this nightmare given over when the nirav modi bank scam surfaced, threatening to rob the bjp of its principal plank of fighting corruption. nobody was blaming the prime minister yet but the jeweller being able to avoid detection and his hurried flight abroad days before the scam got outed posed serious questions to the government., the economic decline, failing law and order underscored by the padmavat violence and attacks on muslims and dalits, not to mention the impression of inaction on corruption, all added up to what looked like early signs of disenchantment with the first majority government in 30 years. achhe din which the leader promised to huge expectation in 2014 increasingly resembled a bad joke on a trusting people. against this background, it wasn’t surprising that the congress and its newly appointed president began to be spoken of as an alternative. mr. gandhi, previously held to be without any attractions, had shown leadership qualities during the gujarat campaign. there was a comfortable niceness about him which contrasted with the relentless aggression of the prime minister and his party chief., but anyone who had observed how unerringly the modi-shah leadership turned adversity to advantage would have known the story wouldn’t end there. the prime minister and his chief strategist had a record of ensuring every defeat — whether in delhi or in bihar — was avenged the soonest. by now, it should be clear that the bjp bosses have perfected a formula which delivers victory by any means. this comprises punishing hard work, inducing defections to form a government with or without election, a loyal television media ever willing to skewer the opposition, an army of social media trolls and brilliant use of messaging platforms like whatsapp to communicate both real and fake news. add to this the backing of the razor-sharp rashtriya swayamsevak sangh and mr. modi’s enduring charisma and way with words, and you have a behemoth that cannot be beaten easily — certainly not by a congress mired in ideological confusion and possessing a lazy leadership that, despite an astonishing run of defeats, believes 2019 is its for the asking. consider this. in tripura, the bjp fielded a dozen defectors, most of whom won. earlier, it had followed the same strategy in uttar pradesh. the defectors had held important positions in the parent party, and took with them their massive support base.",0.0606988249845393,adversity advantage :

2018-04-12,a potent tool for social change ,"comrades in action safdar hashmi and n.k. sharma performing in a street play | photo credit: special arrangement , come april 12, the streets and its corners are abuzz with activity. one is not referring to demonstrations or mass protests. it is a day when country wide, groups perform street theatre to celebrate the national street theatre day (nstd) at diverse venues. it could be adjoining the vegetable shops or a park or a bus stop or an open area in a commercial or industrial complex., nstd coincides with safdar hashmi’s birth anniversary, who died in 1989 succumbing to injuries received during a lethal attack by hooligans while performing the street play halla bol in sahibabad. talking about nstd’s genesis, sahmat’s rajinder prasad recalls, “safdar’s passing created an upsurge of protest among people cutting across party and ideological divide. from workers to peasants and students to professionals spoke in one voice. seeing that, we decided to celebrate his birthday as street theatre day. our call saw unleashing of plays and from then on it has continued since three decades now.” , spotlight on farmer, what makes the street theatre on this day unique is the uniform theme it deals with. this reflects in the thematic poster that sahmat releases every year and sends to different theatre groups. earlier editions saw celebrating bertolt bretch in 1998 or faiz ahmed faiz in 2010 or calling for protest against iraq war (2003), attack of free speech or gujarat riots (2002, 2005, 2012). this year the focus is on ‘kisan’, emphasising on agrarian distress and farmers’ protest., at sahmat’s delhi office, three plays will be staged today. these are bigul’s ann data; bhain (cow’s mooing) by maitreyi college’s abhivyakti; and ankur’s (sgtb khalsa college) kheti bhari (farming is a burden). all of them are about farmers and their problems. the first deals with the vicious debt trap that farmers are caught in, while bhain is a comic satire about the protagonist wanting to be gau rakshak. the last talks about farmers’ suicide, indebtedness and poverty. , ‘weapon of dissent’, with changing times one wonders about the relevance of street theatre in today’s fast-paced life. historian sohail hashmi feels otherwise. “its efficacy has not gone down over the years. it is effective for trade unions or women’s organisations or people or students agitating about an issue. street theatre is a potent weapon of dissent.”, new delhi, 10/04/2013: sohail hashmi seen during a release function of a book 'the sahmat collective art and activism in india since 1989', in new delhi on april 10, 2013. photo: sushil kumar verma | photo credit: sushil kumar verma , citing example of aurat staged by safdar’s jan natya manch, hashmi recalls, “staged at conferences and rallies, it was watched by women in thousands who felt aggrieved about their status. likewise, halla bol, his last play about workers’ victimisation and exploitation, was so powerful that it made vested interests attack him. even today this art form is used effectively in colleges and campuses and by several ngos, women and self-help groups, to espouse a cause. street theatre will remain relevant as long as social, political and economic issues dominate.”, noted theatre actor and safdar’s associate, n. k. sharma, makes a pertinent observation. “street theatre in isolation is ineffective. you just don’t go to a place, perform and leave. the show needs to be supported by groups and organisations. for example, in 1980s, we staged dtc ki dhandli, a 15-minute skit at different places against hike in bus fares. everywhere we were supported by trade unions and consumer groups, helping us reach masses and thereby forcing the government to relent.”, prasad points out that street theatre has now been adopted by government agencies to spread awareness about family planning and hygiene. “though traditionally staged by left oriented groups, now even right wingers are opting for it,” he quips. sohail deems government use of street theatre for messaging programmes, inappropriate. “street theatre is known to be agitational propaganda and does not fit government’s programmes. street theatre’s aim is to present an issue without offering any solution; make audience aware, think, raise questions, react and start a conversation, which is not feasible in plays on social and health related issues.”, for both m. k. raina, safdar’s friend and compatriot, and sharma, participation in street theatre was a different experience altogether. “i admire their democratic method of functioning. a script is never attributed to a playwright. with a basic outline in hand, all the members contribute to build the plot. from rehearsals to actual staging, one can feel the sense of camaraderie,” observes raina. unlike proscenium, the street form enables continuous improvisation. “this is true about the script, dialogues and verses in the play. requiring presence of mind, it allows impromptu change. many years ago, in a play, a protagonist playing cop was heckled by a policeman in the audience. latching on that, the actor changed his dialogue forcing an interaction with policeman much to audience delight.”, ",0.13599542220231875,potent tool social change,"comrades action safdar hashmi n.k. sharma performing street play &#124;

2018-06-23,wages of vigilantism,"the recurring incidents of lynching and targeted mob violence against vulnerable groups reported from various parts of the country are a direct challenge thrown by right-wing groups to political processes, especially electoral processes and the rule of law. according to india spend, a data-journalism website, 86% of those killed in lynching incidents in 2017 were muslims. in september 2017 the supreme court, responding to a public interest litigation, directed all state governments to take measures to prevent vigilantism in the name of cow protection. however, public lynching or vigilante violence hasn’t subsided; in fact, it has spread from uttar pradesh, jharkhand and haryana to gujarat, rajasthan, madhya pradesh and west bengal. an overwhelming majority of these attacks are bovine related, although there are other reasons for anti-minority attacks, too. hate violence has also happened around festivals such as ram navami (bihar and west bengal), provocations over azaan and namaz (gurugram in haryana) and violence against those looking overtly muslim (u.p. and haryana trains). the victims in cases of lynching are almost entirely from poor families., south asia has a long history of communal violence, but these were primarily big episodes of mass violence. this has now given way to a smaller-scale of conflict and vigilante violence against individuals endorsed by state inaction. one possible reason for this shift could be an attempt to avoid public scrutiny that accompanies mass violence, whilst at the same time ensuring that minorities are continually kept under siege through targeted attacks. india has a poor record when it comes to prevention and punishment of the perpetrators of mass violence and/or lynchings. each event of violence has hardened community boundaries and widened the divide between hindus and muslims., also readwave of lynchings , wave of lynchings , citizens against hate (cah), a civil society group investigating and seeking to provide legal help to victims of hate crimes, has documented 50 lynching deaths (muslims), including three lynched in the last one week — two in godda, jharkhand (june 14) and one in hapur, u.p. (june 18) over rumours of cow slaughter/smuggling. according to the cah report, ‘lynching without end’, published in september 2017, 97% of cow-related lynchings had occurred since the bharatiya janata party’s (bjp) rise to political dominance in 2014., most of these attacks were based on rumours sparked by accusations that the victims, almost always muslims, slaughtered or smuggled cows. the content of these rumours and fears often circulating on social media take the shape of communal stereotypes of victims either eating beef or intending to do so, or showing any form of perceived disrespect for cows, which is broadly claimed as a motivation for lynching. most actors leading the charge are suspected to belong to, or have connections with, groups such as the vishwa hindu parishad (vhp), bajrang dal, gau raksha dal and hindu yuva vahini. professing allegiance to hindu right-wing parties, they feel emboldened by a political regime that has prioritised a crackdown on cow slaughter. the back-end support comes from bjp mps providing political protection to these organisations and their activities., what explains the phenomenon and spread of lynchings across several states? apart from the political reasons alluded to above, the rising trend is directly related to the intensification of communal polarisation and instrumentalisation of prejudice for political ends apparent in various government attempts to infuse religion into politics and education. in the event, these acts seem to have acquired a certain degree of legitimacy in the public mind. also, it’s important to acknowledge the widespread role of violence in indian politics which is not considered an illegitimate form of politics. popular anger, outrage and violence are integral features of everyday politics in contemporary india. the feeling that mobs are exacting bollywood style justice beyond the procedures of law, with crowds of locals triumphantly watching the gruesome spectacle captured by videos that subsequently go viral, has its own vicarious fascination., as hate crimes grow, so does the sense of impunity enjoyed by the actual perpetrators of the crime and those who prompt it. lack of justice for victims further reinforces the vicious cycle of impunity. there is also little condemnation of lynchings by those in positions of authority except in very generalised terms. the strategic silence of the bjp-rashtriya swayamsevak sangh (rss) leadership works like unspoken approval to carry out the attacks. the tacit endorsement of mob violence may be the most disturbing effect of decades of communal politics in india. the lack of public reaction to recent incidents implies a degree of acceptability of violence as an expression of vengeance against ‘injustices’ suffered by hindus in the past. the theory of ‘hindu insecurity’ and ‘hindu persecution’ comes at a time when political representation of muslims in legislatures and administration and their presence in the public sphere is at its lowest since independence., also readit’s time to enact an anti-lynching law , it’s time to enact an anti-lynching law",-0.06228991596638656,wages vigilantism,"recurring incidents lynching targeted mob violence vulnerable groups reported various parts country direct challenge thrown right-wing groups political processes , especially electoral processes rule law. according india spend , data-journalism website , 86 % killed lynching incidents 2017 muslims. september 2017 supreme court , responding public interest litigation , directed state governments take measures prevent vigilantism name cow protection. however , public lynching vigilante violence ’ subsided ; fact , spread uttar pradesh , jharkhand haryana gujarat , rajasthan , madhya pradesh west bengal. overwhelming majority attacks bovine related , although reasons anti-minority attacks , too. hate violence also happened around festivals ram navami ( bihar west bengal ) , provocations azaan namaz ( gurugram haryana ) violence looking overtly muslim ( u.p. haryana trains ) . victims cases lynching almost entirely poor families. , south asia long history communal violence , primarily big episodes mass violence. given way smaller-scale conflict vigilante violence individuals endorsed state inaction. one possible reason shift could attempt avoid public scrutiny accompanies mass violence , whilst time ensuring minorities continually kept siege targeted attacks. india poor record comes prevention punishment perpetrators mass violence and/or lynchings. event violence hardened community boundaries widened divide hindus muslims. , also readwave lynchings , wave lynchings , citizens hate ( cah ) , civil society group investigating seeking provide legal help victims hate crimes , documented 50 lynching deaths ( muslims ) , including three lynched last one week — two godda , jharkhand ( june 14 ) one hapur , u.p.

2018-06-25,in the crossfire between art and life,"last friday, denizens of the city were able to sample the work of promising young pianist sahil vasudeva in the unrecital, the intriguingly titled show he performed at the royal opera house. part concert, part performance art, the show sees vasudeva juxtapose events from his life with musical selections (including his own compositions) played live on a grand piano made available by ubiquitous music retailers furtados. voiceovers and projections give us a sense of the zeitgeist in which vasudeva situates himself, caught in the crossfire between single-minded artistic pursuit and the more conventional demands of life., it is a work created for intimate spaces, which has been vasudeva’s schtick — transporting the western classical recital from stodgy concert halls or hotel foyers into the lofts and nooks of an vibrant alternative arts scene. here, back in a formal setting, replete with its rarefied art deco vibe, vasudeva stands out, as he must, as a budding virtuoso unsure of his settings. placed at a vantage, with a characteristic shock of unruly hair his signature attribute, audiences attentively watch his profile, leg firmly on pedal, as his articulate fingers draw us into debussy or chopin, traces of each note lingering on like wisps of smoke., musical testimonies, in between his playing, vasudeva rustles up visuals of his alter-egos, or lived personas, while offering commentary in a distinctly self deprecatory tenor good for laughs. in silhouette, he is an investment banker fired from his job for being empathetic rather than hawkish. later, on grainy video, we catch him as a glorified busker in a five-star do where the pianoforte is never the burnished centerpiece, but merely the backdrop to hors d’oeuvres and nimble-footed socialising. these are circles where talent is never the thing that is weighed in gold., there is something to be said of vasudeva bringing his contemplative introversion into full light in the manner of a testimonial. the material, and the compositions that add to its melancholic mood, speaks of the proverbial chip on an artist’s shoulder that must be outgrown fairly quickly lest it fester into the emblem of one’s martyrdom at the altar of high commerce. it appears to be a struggle that has not yet been fully transcended. bitter-sweet ironies surface in vasudeva’s conversations with his mother or friends or event managers on phone, or his whatsapp chats with his erstwhile boss., reflections of life, in the backdrop are the overdone visuals from television featuring the usual suspects — a raging arnab goswami, teeming gau rakshaks, and the conditioning television ads that might have been a diversion in one’s youth but which were also insidiously indoctrinating. the basket of deplorables contains both of vasudeva’s pet peeves — the facetiously liberal elite and the illiberal reactionaries. against a video loop of the raymond commercials that project the simulacrum of a ‘perfect man’ in worsted flannels, he consummately plays schumann’s traumerie, whose opening riffs have been reduced to a cliché, but his rendition allows even the familiar to soar unexpurgated into fresh territory., the eponymous ‘unrecitalisation’, with the use of mixed media tropes, is naïvely artless in many ways, if never insincere. the projections of chaotic disorder create a world of ‘them and us’ in which the mainstream is effectively othered without nuance of complicity — a position that only the privileged might afford. for instance, goswami’s invective might be manna from the heavens to his ilk bolstering their confirmation bias, but vasudeva plods on in a resolute echo chamber of his own, playing accessible selections that don’t quite push the envelope, lest it alienate untrained ears, even if his talent is undeniably prodigious.",0.2376784455854223,crossfire art life,"last friday , denizens city able sample work promising young

2018-06-26,at the crossroads: on mob violence," , this is about footage and photographs of two events, like two strips of memory; cuttings from everydayness. one of them, from hapur in uttar pradesh this month, shows a vigilante group hunting for alleged cow slaughterers and smugglers. it is a blood sport. the mob picks up sameyddin, a 65-year-old man, and forces him to confess. it then drags a 45-year-old, qasim, like a sack before it lynches him. he begs for water as he is being beaten up, but the mob refuses., what is even more terrifying than the violence is the indifference of the policemen in front of the crowd. they don’t seem to care, barely registering the event. an apology from the authorities is an ironic addition to the unbelievable tableau., the second incident occurred in may, at ramnagar in uttarakhand’s nainital district. a hindu woman and a muslim man get isolated in a temple. the mob drags the man out, hitting him at random. a policeman stands up to the mob, protecting the victim with his body. the crowd around waits in anticipation. all that stands between them and their target is the sikh policeman., two videos, two fragments, two vignettes of violence. how does one react to the chronicler of violence? every interpretation is an act of risk, and a mediation on violence demands nothing less., marshall mcluhan, the philosopher of communication once claimed pithily that ‘the medium is the message’. mcluhan’s comments may have become textbook clichés but even now the original power of the insight seeps through. we realise more and more that how we communicate determines what we communicate. we sense this as we watch the video., violence in india today is always communicated as a video strip; a piece of gossip floating in digital time. today we feel that the video as a fragment embodies us best. the video presents voyeurism combined with the open bleakness of an anatomy class. the irony is that an instrument that recorded family marriages has now become the archive for the collective violence of the time. between video and selfie, we write today’s history. mob violence is the new serial of our time., we have to theorise a little about the video before we analyse the two fragments more specifically. it is not merely that the video/photograph captures every act of public violence, it also makes the private public. the image links violence as an act of production with violence as consumption. it is almost as if it attempts to create a new idea of the social. the old idea of the social around the family or state sounds tired and empty, even stale. the new social is quick to form and quick to dispense. it is represented by the mob. today the social, or the sense of the collective, is constituted around the mob and its violence., three terms then become critical: the mob, the spectacle and the spectator. it is as if the mob has taken over history and myth, combining the worst of nature and culture. there is no equivalent of the hero in history, as in the warrior or the satyagrahi. there is no concept like class or state, just the mob waiting for a random trigger. the mob’s double is the crowd. there is little to choose from — one plays the perpetrator and the other the spectator. both are hungry for the spectacle. the only reminder that we live in a society subject to constitutional rules is the policeman. the policeman too can merge into the background and play the spectator indifferent to spectacle. his indifference, his boredom have an edge as he sits as if waiting for his favourite serial. the victim, by the very label dalit, muslim or woman, is the only social category; the scapegoat marked for violence. the indifference of the police in the video appears both surreal and slapstick. it spooks justice, the concept of duty, the constitution as they let the violence go on. of course, it all occurs in u.p. but u.p. could be any place on earth. the lynch mob has not only overtaken law and order but also overwhelmed history and civics. the only humanity might be with the victim, in his vulnerability, in his desperation to communicate, in his scream, in his powerlessness, protests against brute force and against the fact that law, morals, language, rules, prayer are all helpless. a god might listen out of pity or even habit, but not a mob. depraved human behaviour makes savage animal behaviour look tame. animals rarely demand excess, but excess is the first signal of the mob., violence today lacks a sense of myth or even metaphor. there is no sense of the epic to the events — banality literally dogs them. it is as if it is in the hobbesian world that the digital domain finds expression. the history of man with the mob in control is ‘nasty, brutish and short’. the body is devoid of any sense of sacrament. it is dispensable. the indian cosmos is like a butcher’s shop, and it is no longer picasso or goya who are relevant. one remembers the norwegian painter edvard munch. his painting, ‘the scream’, is more relevant as it captures violence and sheer primordiality of pain. it captures the brutality, the sheer barbarism of man against man., the two events in a way create a fable, an indian version of the good samaritan. the good samaritan as a story does not only belong to the bible. like all great religious tales, it is universal, producing vernacular variations everywhere.",0.04072966507177032,crossroads : mob violence,", footage photographs two events , like two strips memory ;

2018-08-18,shaping the india we live in: on jairam ramesh's 'intertwined lives',"jairam ramesh, who is fast becoming our foremost chronicler of the indira gandhi years, has produced a life of p.n. haksar, her “ideological compass and moral beacon from may 1967 to january 1973, guiding her through her magnificent achievements: the nationalisation of banks, coal and oil refineries, abolition of privy purses, victory over pakistan...” and so forth., in telling haksar’s story, he relies on the voluminous papers that lie in the haksar archives at nehru memorial, letting him speak for himself through the documents. this has both advantages and disadvantages. the reader is brought into direct touch with primary source material and can almost hear haksar’s voice. but the extensive documentation also crowds out commentary, analysis, and context that younger readers might have found useful., it is not easy for my generation, who lived through those years, to forget how far we have come from the times when haksar virtually ran the government of india and guided mrs. gandhi’s hand on the tiller of the ship of state. looking back, those were years of continuous crisis. parliament was attacked by gau rakshaks in january 1966, we were short of food and lived ‘from ship to mouth’ on pl480 grain from the u.s., rupee devaluation was a political and economic disaster, the congress party was split in slow motion and mrs. gandhi’s authority threatened by the syndicate, and the congress lost control of significant states in 1967. if the economy and internal politics were fragile, the external situation was no less challenging. a young and inexperienced prime minister was surrounded by enemies within her party and government. that she and haksar not only survived this but put their stamp on the republic and polity for several years to come and led india out of the morass is truly remarkable. it is this historic achievement that qualifies mrs. gandhi as one of india’s greatest leaders and haksar as one of our most influential civil servants ever., it is haksar who was responsible for the pronounced populist and leftward turn that india’s politics took between 1969 and 1973. left to herself, i am not sure if mrs. gandhi would have done all that she did. her behaviour and policy choices without haksar suggest a far more pragmatic and centrist inclination than bank nationalisation and the 10 point programme. after all the aicc had approved the 10 point programme in mid-1967 but she only began implementing it and the young turks’ agenda in 1969 after she came under direct attack by the syndicate and when they foisted sanjeeva reddy on her as the presidential candidate, a move that kamaraj later admitted was designed to prepare the way for her removal from prime ministership. she fought back with the populist leftward turn that resulted in her massive electoral victory in march 1971 on the slogan garibi hatao., in terms of external policy the duo’s list of accomplishments is most impressive, since they came when the external environment was actually worsening from india’s point of view, whether with china and the u.s. coming together in 1971, or with pakistan. their high-point was of course the birth of bangladesh in 1971 and the handling of the crisis.",0.16721014492753622,shaping india live : jairam ramesh ' '

2018-08-20,celebration of the sacrifice,"in company of goats: a scene at delhi’s jama masjid ahead of id-ul-adha | photo credit: shiv kumar , when the prophet abraham or ibrahim saw god in a dream, he was commanded to sacrifice his most loved possession to him. the patriarch was greatly troubled and got up with a start, wondering what to do. he had many sheep, rams, and other animals, besides wives, concubines and slaves and an only son. so, after much thought, he decided to sacrifice him. the next morning he told his son that they were going to offer a sacrifice to god on mount moriah and asked him to prepare for the journey. they took fuel-wood and a fire-pot and embarked on the long trek to be the mount. there, both father and son set up an altar, put the fuel-wood on it and when the son asked where the animal for sacrifice was, abraham, replied, “god will provide it.” , dearest possession, he then bound his son and put him on the stone altar and took out a knife to sacrifice him. just as he lifted up his hand to do so, an angel appeared and told him to desist, for god was convinced that he loved him more than even in his dearest possession. suddenly a ram emerged, caught by its horns in a thorn bush. abraham sacrificed the ram, unbound his son and returned home., this is the event which is celebrated as bakrid, now better known as id-ul-zuha or id-ul-adha, on which the haj pilgrimage also culminates at kabah, where abraham had built a house of god 4,000 or so years ago, with its sacred black stone. somehow jews and christians don’t celebrate the sacrifice of abraham as id but only islam has adhered to the perpetuation of the episode, though it came into being over 600 years after christ. but jews and christians continue to honour abraham in other ways as they regard him as their “father in faith”. , one remembers that in the pre-partition days bakrid was marked by sacrifices in nearly every well-to-do home, except for those on the poverty line, who pooled money and offered a combined sacrifice, though goats and sheep did not cost so much then. that was the time when there were no restrictions on sacrificing bigger animals and cows and buffaloes were also chosen for “qurbani”. some even sacrificed camels, like usman sahib, though in arabia they once probably also included horses for the purpose. , it is pertinent to remember that there were no cows there in significant number and so there was no question of their sacrifice., to go back to the pre-independence days, a nawab’s kothi in the walled city was the place where the largest number of “qurbanis” took place, and the butcher was qayyum, who divided goat and sheep parts, keeping the best portions for the nawab’s household and the entrails and others for distribution to the poor, among whom were the sheikh mehtars or sweepers who had embraced islam. qayyum is long dead and so also the nawab sahib, f.z. khan sherwani, and his children and the kothi is now a divided property among those not even related to him, with part of it becoming a school and the portion occupied by the servants and the resident dhoban and her family also in the possession of encroachers after the building and its vast compound were declared evacuee property post-1947, with the nawabzadas and nawabzadis migrating to karachi, lahore and rawalpindi after the death of their parents, who are both buried at the sayyidna in agra., during the last years of his reign, bahadur shah zafar had imposed a complete ban on cow slaughter in keeping with the tradition set by his ancestor akbar. the order may have been flouted in the villages but in the year preceding the first war of independence of 1857 the ban was strictly enforced in the urban area to strengthen communal harmony. , zafar may have heard rumours about the gathering storm that was to strike north india but his subjects knew more about it even before the lotus and the chappati began to make their rounds over hundreds of miles. , cautioning zafar",0.14652777777777776,celebration sacrifice,"company goats : scene delhi ’ jama masjid ahead id-ul-adha &#124;

2018-10-11,polls and polarisation politics,"the political discourse, as assembly elections approach, is slipping to new lows. addressing a rally in madhya pradesh recently, the president of the bharatiya janata party (bjp), amit shah, once again described infiltrators as “termites”. earlier, speaking at a rally in rajasthan, he said that he was confident that the bjp would win every election despite incidents of mob lynching, naming mohammed akhlaq. at the party’s national executive meeting last month, he had declared that if the bjp comes to power in 2019, it would stay put in office for another 50 years. , but what is the basis of this self-confidence in the face of the poor record in office and the unravelling of the party’s own carefully constructed social constituency? this self-assurance stems from the belief that a politics of polarisation will pay dividends. development and corruption were two major poll issues in 2014 when narendra modi projected himself as the harbinger of development. both these issues have lost their appeal as non-hindutva supporters who backed the bjp on the promise of development are disenchanted. the bjp appears to be refurbishing its strategy with greater prominence given to hindutva, reflected in the high-pitched communal rhetoric of the past few months. , that this strategy is driven from the top is evident from the manner in which the bjp president has been focussing on the national register of citizens (nrc) issue, which is ideally suited to create polarisation. mr. shah has set the pace for this. while raising the issue of the nrc in a rally in gangapur town in sawai madhopur, he said that ‘crores of illegal infiltrators’ have entered the country like ‘termites’ and should be ‘uprooted.’ he has been sticking to this theme in several speeches, warning for instance: “bjp sarkar ek-ek ghuspaithiye ko chun-chun kar matdata suchi se hatane ka kaam karegi (the bjp government will remove every infiltrator from the voters’ list).” , the ‘chun-chun ke nikalenge’ threat to the illegal bangladeshi immigrants becomes clearer when viewed together with the proposed citizenship (amendment) bill of 2016. this bill would permit hindus, sikhs, buddhists, jains, parsis and christians from afghanistan, pakistan and bangladesh to be eligible for indian citizenship, but not muslims, and if passed would violate article 14 guaranteeing equality before law. through this, the bjp is aiming to polarise indians to convince them that what is rightfully theirs is being snatched away by ‘outsiders’. hence, mr. shah is bringing up the issue in rally after rally to target minorities. at a public meeting in kolkata, on august 11, he asked: “are the bangladeshi infiltrators a security threat to this country or not?”, such acidic comments are echoed by other bjp leaders in their mobilisation campaigns. the sharpened focus on bangladeshi immigrants, the nrc, the 2106 surgical strikes on pakistan, to name a few such issues, are an indication of the tone and tenor of the bjp’s combative political strategy for 2019. the nrc issue is particularly important for its political agenda as it signals the shifting relationship between the indian state and its diverse citizens and communities on questions of citizenship, equality and democracy., several commentators point out that the bjp has begun to forefront a combative strategy because of the growing feeling that the ruling dispensation is unlikely to repeat the 2014 performance. at the same time, it’s important to remember that polarisation has been an indispensable part of its campaign strategy, and is embedded in its ideology. for the bjp, creating a hindu-muslim divide is at the heart of its quest for a hindu consolidation. many state elections after 2014 have witnessed aggressive pitching of divisive issues rather than development. this happened during the gujarat and uttar pradesh elections in 2017. same was the case in bihar in 2015 and karnataka in 2018. moreover, this type of campaign is always conducted at the grass-root level by the rss-bjp cadres even when on occasion the top leadership is speaking a less divisive language. whether the communal dimension should be highlighted by the leaders in their speeches depends on the assessment of the ground situation and its intensity varies from phase to phase of the election campaign., from independence, india’s politics had taken the form of a consensus pertaining to issues about nationhood and majority-minority relations. clearly, that consensus has broken down, with the bjp keen to break away from the traditional national discourse. in the past too, religion wasn’t divorced from politics since it is part of the political landscape, but it is certainly more strident now. one important reason for the democratic regression is the majoritarianism promoted by the bjp as the dominant ideology since it came to power. the second reason is growing incidents of mob lynchings, which have emerged as a critical element of the new political order. it is not conventional hindu-muslim violence but targeted violence that is no longer episodic but a continuum, with lynching of muslims on issues ranging from allegations of cow slaughter to love jihad to petty theft. most of these incidents are perpetrated by vigilante militias and are the direct result of the communal atmosphere that the hindu right has created, leaving little scope for recourse to justice against persons who commit these hate crimes.
