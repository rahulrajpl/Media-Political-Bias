2012-02-02,beyond the rafale deal,"india's decision to select dassault aviation of france to supply 126 rafale multi-role fighters caps a process that began in 2007 to replace the indian air force's ageing mig-21s and augment its fleet of sukhoi 30mkis. given the size of the contract — which, at upwards of $10 billion, is the largest defence deal struck by india — the acquisition of the medium multi-role combat aircraft (mmrca) was viewed in many quarters as a purchase in which political and strategic considerations would, or even should, play a role. such a view was bolstered by the fact that each of the six competing aircraft originally short-listed had a lot to offer, the differences between them lying more along the perimeter than in the core. that technical and commercial factors prevailed over extra-contractual considerations became evident when the competition, following a slew of technical tests, was narrowed to two — the rafale and the typhoon, produced by a consortium of four european countries. clearly, the selection process was uninfluenced by the united states administration, which had lobbied hard in favour of boeing's f/a-18 and lockheed martin's f-16, suggesting that the acquisition of either was an important element in forging a closer strategic relationship. the rejection of the u.s.-manufactured aircraft underlined that we had, as one commentator wryly but wrongly noted, “settled for a plane, not a relationship.”",0.08888888888888889,beyond rafale deal,"india ' decision select dassault aviation france supply 126 rafale multi-role fighters caps process began 2007 replace indian air force ' ageing mig-21s augment fleet sukhoi 30mkis. given size contract — , upwards $ 10 billion , largest defence deal struck india — acquisition medium multi-role combat aircraft ( mmrca ) viewed many quarters purchase political strategic considerations would , even , play role. view bolstered fact six competing aircraft originally short-listed lot offer , differences lying along perimeter core. technical commercial factors prevailed extra-contractual considerations became evident competition , following slew technical tests , narrowed two — rafale typhoon , produced consortium four european countries. clearly , selection process uninfluenced united states administration , lobbied hard favour boeing ' f/a-18 lockheed martin ' f-16 , suggesting acquisition either important element forging closer strategic relationship. rejection u.s.-manufactured aircraft underlined , one commentator wryly wrongly noted , “settled plane , relationship . ”","{'bjp': 0, 'cong': 0}",0,0

2015-04-09,a meeting in paris,"there is quite an air of anticipation around the indian prime minister’s visit to france. the government’s foreign policy pace has been enviable, and narendra modi has demonstrated a remarkable aptitude in gauging the mood and the space to manoeuvre with various partners. he has revitalised old relationships and lent them his energy. he has also achieved some real strategic gains, >such as the one in seychelles. the visit to france is pregnant with possibilities that are rooted in a historic context and which now need to be leveraged on a broader plane., france has always been a critical partner to india in high technology areas. its bid to aid india in the diversification of its defence sector began as early as 1953, when the dassault-ouragan fighters were supplied to the india air force and played a leading role in the 1961 liberation of goa. significantly, when india-u.k. defence relations soured in the 1970s, france emerged as the only western power willing to supply india with state-of-the-art weaponry and support its space programme and nuclear development. the importance of france as a key partner was accentuated in 1998 when, following india’s nuclear tests, france actively thwarted united nations security council sanctions and forced a toning down of the final language even as the russians dithered. during that period, india’s agreement to launch satellites from french guinea stayed intact despite the sanctions imposed by other european union countries across a range of technological sectors, especially space. in 1999, during the kargil war, the french maintained a supply of spares to the iaf, which allowed it to operate without worrying about expending smart weapon reserves., france was arguably the first western country to de-hyphenate its relations with pakistan from those with india, deciding that the artificial “balance of power” equation between the two was passé. today, france is at the forefront of india’s ambitions of modernising its sub-surface fleet. scorpène class submarines are being built at mazagaon docks and dassault’s rafale has won the medium multi-role combat aircraft (mmrca) tender. india’s only dedicated military satellite, the gsat-7, was launched from ariane 5, from kourou., despite all this, it seems as if the tenor of the indo-french engagement is being determined only by >the progress on the rafale deal. much like the u.s. and india relationship, which had to find a way past the civil nuclear agreement that hung heavy like the proverbial albatross, the india-france partnership must move beyond the circular meanderings that the negotiations look like to outsiders. one way or another, we must strive for an early conclusion, as this is not just about one set of aircraft but about investment in a host of current and future possibilities presented by >india’s growing economic and geo-strategic strength. the rafale deal must be placed in a broader framework of association. this framework could include three key elements, among others., nuclear cooperationthe first is for france to translate into action its previously expressed acceptance of india’s stance of nuclear exceptionalism and for the two countries to enter into full-spectrum collaboration. such a partnership should be aimed at reducing the incubation time of indian nuclear technologies and would cover the full nuclear cycle, including reactors, enrichment and reprocessing. this nuclear cooperation would logically extend into the sphere of military nuclear propulsion. the upcoming french barracuda class ssn, for example, is optimally suited to the indian navy’s needs. if india buying the rafale is the truest sign of india’s commitment to the relationship, then the nuclear submarine may well be the litmus test of french reciprocity., but, again, it is important not to get fixated only on the big-ticket items but to use the other opportunities that signature government initiatives like “skilling” and “make in india” offer alongside these big deals. the french could, for example, help develop the defence sector eco-system in india, especially in the small and medium segments, investing in skills and capacity building here. this is where the real value addition takes place in the defence business and this could be the differentiator between france and other countries., the second element must be regional cooperation. increasingly, the interests of the two countries have intersected and their views tend to be similar even if their positions are not. much of this is because indian and french foreign policies share the same fundamental view of strategic autonomy and refuse to cede security primacy to one or two actors. it was because of this that india had, in 2013, co-sponsored a un resolution that paved the way for french intervention in mali. this is why it needs to cooperate in the indian ocean, west asia and north africa. india and france have significant interests here and it is perhaps time to build a robust platform for dialogue that will allow the two nations to cooperate meaningfully., west asia and north africa are in the midst of a turbulent period of dramatic change. india’s chief task is to secure its energy source, the safety of its diaspora, and the stability of its extended neighbourhood. france will continue to play a significant role in the region., as for the indian ocean area, france is a major power here and has demonstrated some degree of interest in cooperating with india. a focussed engagement would also be a natural extension of the collaboration envisaged here between the u.s. and india earlier this year. co-investing with france in a ‘research’ facility located in mauritius may serve as the point of convergence for such a regional play. this could form the basis for intensified cooperation on maritime domain awareness, building capacity in indian ocean rim countries, and in honing synergistic strategies to deal with humanitarian assistance and disaster relief.",0.03693884818884819,meeting paris,"quite air anticipation around indian prime minister ’ visit france. government ’ foreign policy

2015-04-15,"the key is technology, not money","“the prolonged delay over finalising the rafale deal was reportedly over disputes about the role of hindustan aeronautics ltd.” picture shows rafale jet fighters in the dassault factory in merignac near bordeaux, france. | photo credit: regis duvignau , india’s notorious dependence on imported military hardware and the near moribund state of large parts of its public sector defence industry represent a full-blown crisis crying for a solution. india is the world’s largest arms importer and, with at least two decades of not replacing or upgrading obsolescent equipment through either purchases or indigenous manufacture, is on course now to spend around $30 billion in the next few years, and $200 billion in the medium term. for some years now, from the atal bihari vajpayee-led national democratic alliance government in 2001 onwards, the government has been veering towards increased foreign direct investment (fdi) in defence manufacturing as a solution to the defence crisis., the present bharatiya janata party government, despite its rallying ‘make in india’ cry, has further >increased the fdi limit in defence, with 49 per cent now permitted under the automatic route, 75 per cent where technology transfer is involved, and up to 100 per cent in cases involving significant new technology. while some indian companies are wary of the entry of foreign players, most favour opening up the sector with an eye to the potentially lucrative business opportunities they see opening up., for and against fdi the arguments in favour of fdi in defence are familiar. first, public sector companies in defence, research and development and allied industries have consistently failed to meet the requirements of the armed forces, especially given the global revolution in military technology. second, the superior management culture of the private sector will ensure better adherence to budgets and timelines. third, the country is compelled into repeated imports without any technology transfer (despite contractual obligations) because the military is always urgently in need of the technology. therefore, the argument goes, encouraging foreign companies to invest in indian defence and set up industries here will mean that money will be spent within the country, generating jobs and bringing in new know-how, with the possibility of exports., “ all the liberalised provisions since 2001 have led to a meagre inflow of only $4.8 billion, in an overall fdi inflow of around $334 billion.”, the fdi inflow itself tells a tale. all the liberalised provisions since 2001 have led to a meagre inflow of only $4.8 billion, in an overall fdi inflow of around $334 billion. it may be argued that it is too early to judge, but there are actually good reasons why defence companies do not and will not find fdi in another country attractive, and why there are few such examples across the world., fdi means a long-term presence in india, and good returns on investment are possible only if repeat orders or contracts for newer models are assured. but, unlike cars or white goods, that will not always happen in military equipment. there may be gaps of many years or even decades between orders. for instance, india bought the mirage 2000 in the 1980s and has clinched the rafale deal this year, both from dassault of france. in france itself, however, dassault is reasonably assured of continuous business from regular domestic and european orders, as well as from staggered exports. foreign subsidiaries or substantial fdi will, thus, always put pressure on india for repeat orders. would dependence on a lockheed martin (india) or a bharat boeing be really very different from dependence on the u.s. principals?, yes, more of india’s money will be spent in india rather than in other countries. but the defence procurement policy anyway mandates 30 per cent offsets (50 per cent in high-value contracts). in other words, the supplier must spend 30 per cent of the contracted value within india through local manufacture and services. on the other hand, even if manufacture were by an indian subsidiary, some specialised technology or components will always need to be imported. as is the case in car manufacture by korean or japanese subsidiaries in india, where numerous models that sell in smaller volumes are only assembled in india with imported components. fdi may, therefore, not be so different from offsets in terms of local manufacture, jobs, or money spent., where is the technology? it is often simplistically assumed, unfortunately by policymakers too, that fdi will bring in technology. nothing could be farther from the truth. all foreign defence majors have protested continually against offsets, and have pressured india into diluting offset requirements one way or another. while they might cite logistical or other issues, the real anxiety is about sharing and losing control over technology, especially if the offset partner in india is a public company whose bargaining power would be greater than that of a private sector junior partner. the delay over finalising the rafale deal was reportedly over disputes about the role of hindustan aeronautics ltd., “ it is often simplistically assumed, unfortunately by policymakers too, that fdi will bring in technology.”, the present offsets policy is similarly not being used purposefully to acquire technology. offsets are viewed in financial terms — money spent locally and jobs created. instead, offset projects should be studied strategically — indian scientists and companies acquiring the capability to independently develop and manufacture sophisticated military hardware. to rephrase, the goal should be ‘made by india’, not merely ‘make in india’. this is true for all technology, but crucial in defence. india has done it in space and nuclear technology. why not in defence?",0.03943903318903319,"key technology , money","“the prolonged delay finalising rafale deal reportedly disputes role hindustan aeronautics ltd. ” picture shows rafale jet fighters dassault factory merignac near bordeaux , france. &#124; photo credit : regis duvignau , india ’ notorious dependence imported military hardware near moribund state large parts public sector defence industry represent full-blown crisis crying solution. india world ’ largest arms importer , least two decades replacing upgrading obsolescent equipment either purchases indigenous manufacture , course spend around $ 30 billion next years , $ 200 billion medium term. years , atal bihari vajpayee-led national democratic alliance government 2001 onwards , government veering towards increased foreign direct investment ( fdi ) defence manufacturing solution defence crisis. , present bharatiya janata party government , despite rallying ‘make india ’ cry , >increased fdi limit defence , 49 per cent permitted automatic route , 75 per cent technology transfer involved , 100 per cent cases involving significant new technology. indian companies wary entry foreign players , favour opening sector eye potentially lucrative business opportunities see opening up. , fdi arguments favour fdi defence familiar. first , public sector companies defence , research development allied industries consistently failed meet requirements armed forces , especially given global revolution military technology. second , superior management culture private sector ensure better adherence budgets timelines. third , country compelled repeated imports without technology transfer ( despite contractual obligations ) military always urgently need technology. therefore , argument goes , encouraging foreign companies invest indian defence set industries mean money spent within country , generating jobs bringing new know-how , possibility exports. , “ liberalised provisions since 2001 led meagre inflow $ 4.8 billion , overall fdi inflow around $ 334 billion. ” , fdi inflow tells tale. liberalised provisions since 2001 led meagre inflow $ 4.8 billion , overall fdi inflow around $ 334 billion. may argued early judge , actually good reasons defence companies find fdi another country attractive , examples across world. , fdi means long-term presence india , good returns investment possible repeat orders contracts newer models assured. , unlike cars white goods , always happen military equipment. may gaps many years even decades orders. instance , india bought mirage 2000 1980s clinched rafale deal year , dassault france. france , however , dassault reasonably assured continuous business regular domestic european orders , well staggered exports. foreign subsidiaries substantial fdi , thus , always put pressure india repeat orders. would dependence lockheed martin ( india ) bharat boeing really different dependence u.s. principals?

security forces are prepared all the time, and you will find them prepared. when an emergency requirement was there, we managed to help our neighbours, we got water to male, we got our ships in yemen from where not only indian nationals but also other nationals, including pakistanis, were rescued by us. we didn’t say that they are pakistanis because it was a humanitarian issue. but we were the only country which could do that. we went to nepal quickly after the earthquake. so wherever we are on call, we have reacted immediately., today, the defence ministry’s role is not used for diplomatic or soft targets. soft methodology is normally used in political or diplomatic channels. the defence ministry is the hard way. so we have to strengthen our forces. strengthen it to a level that anyone should think twice before considering any misadventure., so you are quite confident in your preparation…, my preparation i am confident of what we are doing. we are building up our strength. again i am very clear. my strength is based on my national interests and it is a defensive posture. but even in a defensive posture, if your strength is adequate and that adequate strength is expressed, i don’t see any reason there should be any talk about threat., the kargil review committee had recommended the appointment of a chief of defence staff (cds). what is the government’s current thinking?, i will take a call on it, maybe in july or so. but to be frank, it is not my decision. the decision has to be of the cabinet committee on security, and the call has to be taken by a security committee. so i will put up my proposal, maybe in july, for consultation, let it be discussed by various people who are concerned and then we will come to a conclusion. i believe that there should be a body which will see the integration of forces. the current arrangement is inadequate, according to me., so in your view, a cds could be required?, the name itself doesn’t have much meaning. what is important is whether the person has the appropriate authority to integrate the forces and to whom his responsibility lies and to what extent. i will give a very simple example. for any army to proceed, you require cover by the air force or sometimes, even the navy. so when the kargil war was being fought, the air force was giving cover to the army. this has to be synchronised. now this synchrony includes acquisition of capital assets. unnecessary duplication of assets should not be there. all these aspects the cds can take care., are you happy with the way the rafale deal has turned out for india?, that is the only solution. in fact, only prime minister narendra modi could have taken this kind of decision. when it comes to prime ministers in the past many years, probably atalji bihari vajpayee showed some decision-making ability. however, i would like to add that the decision is not complete. the decision is only to acquire 36 aircraft at better terms. i was watching the congress press conference, i was surprised they are not aware of exactly what had happened. they probably didn’t even take the required trouble of getting more information. actually, congress leader and former defence ministry a.k. antony should have got it because he knows so many in the defence ministry. the decision is a joint statement at this moment. the rest is being discussed., is there an element of technology transfer involved in the government-to-government rafale deal agreed to by the modi government?, i will not talk about it until all talks are complete. then we will come very clear, transparently. you don’t discuss issues when they are under negotiation and consideration. it will be foolish. it’s just like you don’t discuss publically what is in the court if you a party. third person can always do it. i can’t do it because i am a party to it, my ministry is a party to it. let them have the talks, let them come out with some conclusion… it can assure you it will be so transparent you will not have to ask again., are you satisfied with the situation on the line of actual control with china?, the day i am satisfied, you will not ask me this question. and how would you describe the situation? do you think with prime minister’s visit to china have things improved? i can say it was better than it was earlier. prime minister’s visit abroad has improved things a lot in defence. it has actually strengthened india’s position in defence to a level where i think what could not have been achieved over many years has been achieved in one year., do you see china as a competitor, rival or enemy?, i will always consider it a healthy competitor for growth in economic activity, and i would like to repeat china’s success story in manufacturing., in terms of our defence issues with the chinese, how would you rate that issue?, slowly, over time, i think issues will cool down and get resolved. but if someone expects overnight resolution, that may not possible. what is simmering for the past 66-67 years cannot be expected to be solved overnight., now there is a strong government in delhi, and after 30 years, you have one with a full majority. do you think this is the time for the two governments to take bold decisions to resolve the boundary issue?, many bold initiatives are being taken. in fact, the very progressive nation-building steps which modi is taking have the opponents worried. their attitude to stop the government is not because they are convinced about irrationality or illogical steps being taken. but the steps being taken by the government is going to actually make the nation grow. they are worried on that., because if that happens, they are history. otherwise, the congress can’t speak on the issue of land acquisition. the biggest scams between 2009 and 2012 are by the congress in land acquisition for special economic zones., but your party has supported the land bill when the upa government brought it…",0.15078170336234853,"'

2015-12-13,a cannon yet to fire - not a single big ticket proposal,"foreign firms are unwilling to transfer high-end technology unless the cap is increased to a level above 50 per cent (and perhaps significantly more), because it simply doesn't make business sense. , where does india stand on defence manufacturing and how have the government’s recent moves on easing fdi norms and ease of doing business helped the sector?, the reality on the ground, according to several senior analysts is that little has come in by way of tangible large investments and for now india is still reliant on importing military equipment to fulfil its short term needs., why is this still the case?, following on the heels of its heavy defeat in the bihar elections, the nda government moved quickly to ease fdi regulations for several key sectors including defence. the government allowed foreign investment up to 49 per cent under the automatic route, from the earlier government approval route. it also stipulated that investments exceeding 49 per cent would now be cleared by the foreign investment promotion board rather than going through the more circuitous route of the cabinet committee on security., yet, more than a year after the nda government first announced that it would increase the fdi cap in the defence sector to 49 per cent, from 26 per cent, there is still a reluctance on the part of most global majors to come in with a significant project. part of this problem is linked to an ongoing debate about whether 49 per cent is actually enough given that the limit is designed to ensure that control of the venture remains with the indian companies., from an industry perspective it's long been the opinion of several analysts that unless the fdi cap is increased to at least 74 percent things are unlikely to move on the ground., most other developed countries have recognised the fact that defence production necessarily involves a series of international collaborations. however, as india gradually opens up the sector there remains a lingering sense of mistrust among indian companies who don't want to lose control of the venture. conversely, foreign firms are unwilling to transfer high-end technology unless the cap is increased to a level above 50 per cent (and perhaps significantly more), because it simply doesn't make business sense., but is the debate about investment caps merely a superficial one that covers up some deeper issues with policy planning in defence?, amit cowshish, a former financial advisor to the ministry of defence, explained that in reality there has always been a provision to raise the cap over 49 per cent if it involved a significant transfer of high-tech technology. in september this year, a u.s. official noted that when there was 'industry anxiety over control of technology' then the fdi limit would be increased on a case-to-case basis., yet despite this clause there has not been a single big ticket proposal for investment. figures tabled in parliament in march showed that the government has got just six fdi proposals worth a paltry rs 96 crore ($15.3 million) in the defence production sector, with only two of them being for 49 percent. this was for a period of seven months and the situation hasn't really improved since. in the meantime, india's defence expenditure is expected to accelerate heavily over the next three decades, with the country expected to spend another $120 billion on arms acquisition over the next 10 years., given such a large domestic need, why have indian companies continued to be such poor suppliers and why are foreign companies still unwilling to invest given the potentially huge market., “design and development projects usually entail a long gestation period and there is an inherent risk of failure,” mr. cowshish observed. “therefore no one would run the risk of making heavy investments in such projects unless there is a guarantee of orders coming in and clarity on the exact nature of the domestic market,” he said., there is therefore a catch 22 situation where local manufacturers like bharat forge, l&t and tata require high-end technology to scale up manufacturing but there is no clarity from the mod on what exactly its requirements are. “on the mod website there is a document called the technology prospectus and capability roadmap but the targets mentioned here are vague with no idea even of what the requirements are over the next five or even fifteen years,” mr. cowshish pointed out. “and it is difficult to make out a business case from this document.” another senior industry analysts points out that india has a history of dragging its feet on defence deals. added to this is the fact now that the make in india campaign sends out mixed signals with regards to foreign investment. “there is a hesitation on the part of foreign companies because they don't know where they are going to fit in. it's clear that the mod will now prioritise indian manufacturing,” he explained. the central government is now cognizant of the fact that the majority of technology, at least for the short term, has to come in the form of off-the-shelf purchases like the rafale deal. in the long term, the plan may be to have indian companies scale up to the level of a lockheed or a boeing., but can this be done without properly addressing the issue of creating an ecosystem for the same?, according to rear admiral (retd.) vijai s chaudhari, additional director of the centre for joint warfare studies, a few policy correctives to improve the ease of doing business are imperative.",0.014957087486157247,cannon yet fire - single big ticket proposal,"foreign firms unwilling transfer high-end technology unless cap increased level 50 per cent ( perhaps

2016-02-03,rafale deal will be better on price and delivery: french ambassador richier,"french ambassador francois richier. , president francois hollande’s visit is not a rare one, he was the fifth french leader to be the chief guest at republic day…what do you think were the achievements of the visit?, yes, this is not the first time, but each visit is unique. compared to any other visit in the past, i feel this marked a turning point. with such a trouble world in the backdrop, and the potential of what could happen in india at the same time, this is a significant moment in indo-french history., cooperation on terror, from paris to pathankot, it seems significant that there was a separate joint statement on terror after the meeting between prime minister narendra modi and president hollande. what sort of cooperation do you see emerging from it?, well, this came out of the threat of daesh (isis) to the world, and to france in particular, especially after the attacks in paris. at the same time we have seen new cross-border attacks on india. even if the two dynamics are different, daesh and the groups in pakistan, it was the occasion to highlight our cooperation for years, that wasn’t always talked about., the prime minister too, drew this line from paris to pathankot. in both attacks, there has also been criticism of the counter-terror forces, in paris as well as during the pathankot attacks, that despite prior intelligence on the attacks, they weren’t stopped and the security forces took more time than expected to fight the terrorists. do you anticipate any operational cooperation between india and france on this aspect too?, i think after every attack in any country there is this kind of criticism, because most observers ignore the number of attacks, which have been stopped. several attempts occurred in france before the november attacks, and we didn’t speak about it at that time. margaret thatcher used to say, leaders need to be lucky every time, while terrorists only have to be lucky once. there is always something to learn from bad experiences too, which is why after the january attacks (on charlie hebdo journalists); we briefed the governments of our friendly countries on the operations. similarly, as soon as we have completed our investigations into the paris attacks, we will be briefing india and others. we are still in the midst of an emergency, which might last 2-3 months more. so we discuss our operations, we share information, and we have exchanges like the joint exercises between the armies. gign and nsg are soon going to perform joint exercises as well., what about working together at the international-level. the joint statement records groups like the hizbul mujahideen, let, jud, but will france assist india in having their leaders banned by the unsc, and the prosecution of those who are banned?, the declaration on terrorism is a platform for action in a range of areas. during the joint working group meeting in 2015, we discussed all the areas. the next step is to operationalise this., did the leaders discuss cooperation on fighting isis (daesh)?, we gave the prime minister a sensitive (top security) brief on what we are doing to fight daesh. at the moment we don’t have a common agenda, but since daesh is considered a global threat by the un security council, most likely we can work on a future agenda., even so, india has not joint any coalition against isis. would france like india to join the operations in syria/iraq?, well, there are different ways of joining the coalition. you can condemn the attacks, which india has done, and at the other end of the spectrum, you can engage forces in a military operation as france is doing in iraq and syria as well as against al-qaeda in africa. every country has to define what is most appropriate for it, but of course we would welcome india joining the fight against daesh. what india has sent is a massage of solidarity and increased cooperation at this stage., has india indicated it won’t join the coalition?, we have not asked that., rafale negotiations: end in sight?, to turn to defence cooperation, the rafale deal was mentioned more than once by both leaders during president hollande’s visit. yet even though they spoke of an inter-governmental agreement, only a mou got signed. how do you explain that?, well, it is a mou, but a mou between the two governments, which is a step towards the signing of the iga. the mou is important because it freezes all that we have done since april 2015, in terms of shaping the project, the procedures etc. so everything is now set and there is only one piece missing, which is finalising the price, and that is a matter of a few weeks, hopefully. by signing the mou, we wanted to highlight that only the last mile remains to be done., some would say that the pricing for a deal like this is not just a piece of the puzzle or the last mile. the pricing is the most important part, if the two sides don’t agree on pricing, what then?, i’m quite hopeful they will. of course, the price is important, but what you must look at, is that the two countries are embarking in a cooperation that will last decades, fourty years, maybe more. there is an expectation from india that there will be ‘make in india’ component in all future partnerships for defence aerospace, and yes this is going to happen. as this constitutes deep partnership in this area of aerospace, we are going to see something that has never been done before either by france or by india. so we are not talking just about money. money is the last piece in the iga puzzle, but when it is completed it will be a very large, very ambitious project. the money should not overshadow the strategic element of this defence partnership., yes, but in a way it has already, by holding up the iga. officials in the government say the price of the rafale, which will be finalised will be lower than the price discussed during the previous upa regime, can you confirm that?, we are committed and are on the way to demonstrate that the conditions will be better (than before). better doesn’t just mean lower price, but additional elements. we are going to make it better on all fronts., could you explain that…are you saying the price of the plane may be lower, or the offsets will be reduced?, the price will be better, the conditions for delivery will be better, each and every part of the deal will be better than before., you said it could be a few weeks, president hollande said a couple of days….realistically, how long do you see this price negotiation go on?, let’s say between a few days and a few weeks. to be specific, we need to conclude negotiations, and then the indian government will have to go over its processes for the agreement. so you have to put both sides together. if we talk about the conclusion, where we are involved, i think about four weeks is reasonable. and then there is an indian procedure, which is not in their hands, over which we have no control., you said much depends on the indian government. the rafale deal is unique because this is the first time a deal of this nature has been announced by the prime minister himself, and many of the details of this deal have been discussed by the prime minister and president directly. the invitation to mr. hollande was seen as a signal that the iga was ready to sign. given that there is such a high-level backing to this deal, has the time taken become a test-case for how quickly india can deliver?, well, we have a direction given by our leadership that we have to work out sequentially. there are legal issues, technical issues; supply protocol given these planes will be sold in ‘flyaway’ condition. all these take time, and negotiation of price doesn’t start on day 1, so it’s very premature to say this is a stumbling block. of course, the negotiations could be quicker, but it is completely wrong to draw any link between the president’s visit and the conclusion of the iga. we do not negotiate contracts under pressure of time and neither does india. it is not because there is a visit that negotiations can be accelerated., and you had no expectation of concluding the iga in time for republic day then?, no, it would have been an artificial timeline and in a deal, which will commit the countries for decades, that would have made no sense., the reason i ask is, we do have the example of another deal between india and france, the $6 billion maitri surface to air missile (srsam) deal, which was first announced in 2007, stopped, started, re-announced in 2015….but no real movement on the ground. are you worried the rafale deal could go the way of the maitri deal?, i think there is a strong understanding of what we can do and what india wants. this is a deal for planes in flyaway conditions, but there will be deals for ‘make in india’ in a range of areas. this constitutes a very long-term project. of course till the last moment anything can happen, but the commitment of the top leadership, the indian air force, and the fact that even for us this is an unprecedented deal for france gives me reason to hope it will be concluded soon., when is it that people should worry about it not being completed?, frankly i don’t know. people should start worrying if we are not meeting anymore. if we continue to negotiate then its fine., nuclear project, let’s turn then to the delays in the nuclear power project, the other highlight of the joint statement. the jaitapur project mou, signed in 2009, had always planned for six reactors, but there has been no movement on the ground. are you quite confident that the 2017 deadline for concluding the agreement for the six reactors can be met?, there are two major components to the progress on jaitapur. one that edf (electricite de france) has now taken over areva (nuclear corporation) and thus will be the interlocutor for india, which means edf will provide its own expertise in production and supply of electricity. they know about the concerns of the customer. the second is that the size of the project has changed. it was two and maybe four more but that wasn’t certain. now it will be six in a row. this forces both sides to think in the long-term about producing electricity as quickly as time. india needs electricity desperately and also is committed to increase the share of non-polluting energy sources. so jaitapur is part of the solution for india to cope with electricity crunch and the climate change challenge., yes, but given that only the land has been identified, and clearances still need to be renewed, how soon can this be up and running?, we have given the negotiators one year to wrap up the agreement and the issues are very well-known. the key issue is to reshape the process for six reactors without losing time and the price has to be agreed. our goal is to start construction within a year., india’s liability law is not an issue for france, then?, well, that doesn’t mean we are happy with it. but we respect the parliament here, and just now india has announced its ratification of the convention on supplementary compensation (csc) in january. so we are comfortable with that., and is the contract between l&t and areva for the construction of stainless steel domes for nuclear reactors that was signed in april 2015 still on track with all these changes?, yes. areva is a subsidiary of edf, so the l&t and areva cooperation will have to be a new agreement.,

2016-04-23,realism of the second year,"it is equally clear that despite the large electoral mandate he received in 2014, mr. modi will need to reach out to his political opposition on foreign policy as he approaches his mid-term. , hours before he left for india this month, u.s. >defence secretary ashton carter gave an upbeat account of his upcoming trip at the council on foreign relations, in new york. a slew of agreements were in the works, mr. carter said, and while he didn’t name the logistical support agreement (lsa, now called >logistics exchange memorandum of agreement or lemoa), that was obviously expected to be signed. “we will also conclude several important agreements, including one on commercial shipping information exchange, which will make many new things possible in the future,” he added., significantly, neither the lemoa nor the commercial shipping agreements were actually concluded or signed during the visit that saw the defence secretary in india for three days, his second such visit in a year. officials have variously blamed the fine print, the timing, the unease over the >u.s.’s f-16 sales to pakistan, and the visits (being planned then) by the defence minister and the national security adviser to china as reasons for putting off the signing, but none of them fully explains the failure to clinch an agreement that the u.s. considers one of the “foundational agreements”, expected to ease the two countries’ militaries into a tighter embrace. the expectation is the signing may happen in the next few weeks or possibly in months, when prime minister narendra modi is understood to be considering another visit to washington to bid farewell to u.s. president barack obama, but the moment has been missed., caution as new watchword the lemoa story is significant, not because of any perceived impact on india-u.s. ties, but because it fits into a pattern that seems to have defined foreign policy moves in mr. modi’s second year in office. if in the first year, he was brimming with confidence, the second year has seen more caution, and while several big announcements were made and mr. modi kept up >his frenetic pace of travel, fewer agreements that were negotiated were actually signed or concluded. “it’s the curse of the last mile,” explained a diplomat, who described the disappointment during the carter visit., consider mr. modi’s last visit abroad that began with a >stop in brussels. the visit to brussels for the eu-india summit had been in the works for more than a year, aimed at restarting negotiations on a free trade agreement, formally called the bilateral trade and investment agreement (btia) that had been stalled for four years. more hinges on this than good trade relations — concluding it would signify an end to the four-year logjam between india and >italy over the marines’ issue, and is also key to india’s aspirations this year to join the missile control and nuclear regimes, not to mention its goal of a un security council permanent seat., in private meetings, as well at a press conference addressed by the eu ambassador in january 2015, it was clear that the purpose of the prime minister’s visit would be to announce the restart of talks with his european counterparts. eventually, officials said that despite talks going into extra time ahead of the visit, neither side was able to say “i do” when mr. modi arrived, primarily because of differences on guarantees and data protection., >when he went on to washington, another deal expected to be announced choked at the last minute: for six nuclear reactors to be built by westinghouse. like the btia, this is about much more than the deal; it would be the first evidence that the india-u.s. nuclear deal announced by mr. modi and mr. obama in january 2015 was actually “done”. since january last year, legal teams have travelled back and forth between delhi and washington, trying to iron out the last wrinkle over the issue of liability, but proof of their agreement will only come with the announcement of the first commercial deal, that is, with westinghouse., visiting delhi in january this year, westinghouse ceo daniel roderick said in an interview to reuters that a “commercially significant announcement” would be made when mr. modi came to washington for the nuclear summit in april, but acknowledged that the liability issue was a sticking point. the visit came and went without any announcement. in another interview on the eve of the prime minister’s visit, mr. roderick said he now hoped for something “in june”, perhaps in time for when reports indicate >mr. modi will go again to washington., delays beyond agreed deadlines with australia, the delay on the free trade agreement — >the comprehensive economic cooperation agreement (ceca) as it is known — is equally significant, despite a “hard deadline” of december 2015 set by mr. modi and former australian prime minister tony abbott for its completion. this week, commerce minister nirmala sitharaman said the two sides were “probably getting nearer to a conclusion”, but again no firm sign of it being done years after it was started and months past its deadline date., and then there is the> cliffhanger of the rafale deal that has kept indian and french officials on tenterhooks for more than a year now. when mr. modi made the unusual move (rare for a prime minister to do) of announcing during a state visit to france that india would buy 36 fighter aircraft in a government-to-government “off the rack” agreement, it was meant to signal decisive action that would cut through bureaucratic hurdles in order to procure much-needed military hardware. the year since has proven anything but decisive. negotiations on offsets had to be rescued by a personal call between mr. modi and françois hollande last year, but despite >inviting the french president to the republic day parade, no breakthrough was announced on the pricing issue, and only a memorandum of understanding could be signed. in january, mr. hollande said the deal would be announced in a matter of days, but a deal has not been announced three months later, although reports indicate it is in its “final stages”.",0.09066717596129363,realism second year,"equally clear despite large electoral mandate received 2014 , mr. modi need reach political opposition foreign policy approaches

2017-03-29,compromises happen when a mandate is fractured: manohar parrikar ,"manohar parrikar , reluctant politician in the delhi durbar, manohar parrikar is back where he always wanted to be. in the saddle again as goa chief minister and having won the trust vote in the house, the 61-year-old has got down to business. the bharatiya janata party-led coalition government has sought a vote-on-account for three months and tabled the annual state budget for 2017-18 which will be discussed in the monsoon session. the hectic three-day assembly session over, the chief minister dwells at length, among other things, on the post-poll drama around government formation, his days as defence minister, and why he may actually retire from politics after this stint. from an interview in his office at the state secretariat in panaji:, yes. i was serious. the reason was there was a people’s response to the government ahead of elections. absolutely. try and understand the meaning of what i say when i point out that our vote share went up to 32.5%, which means we have not gone down in terms of voting. at the individual level, it’s sad that so many persons lost., i agree. but i think that the defeats of senior party leaders happened a bit too much on our side, beyond my expectation. maybe because i did not sufficiently gauge the direction of the anger. people went after individuals, and they perhaps did not realise that the overall impact of the manifestation of that anger could result in overall instability., i am not hurt. why should i be hurt? our seats have fallen, but we got our votes even in those constituencies. yes, but definitely i am disturbed by the trend that our people do not think on the lines of a state, think much on the lines of a village panchayat or a municipality, maybe because of the state’s smallness., people cannot be thinking on the lines of individuals, people have to think in terms of a political party. a few individuals here and there is all right, but the overall thinking should be in terms of a mandate for a party., this may be partly happening because of goa being a small and compact state where everyone knows everyone, and partly because people are raising their bar of expectations which is soaring very high., definitely. but expectations cannot be one way. on one side you expect your elected representative to give goodies, personal favours and on the other you expect her/him to be totally clean and deliver as a people’s representative most effectively. i think these are contradictions which people themselves will have to address., that was because they also had realised and felt that the government was not as successful as the regime it succeeded., ideologically, mgp maharashtrawadi gomantak party, one of the oldest regional outfits is not very far from bjp ideology. independents do not come with any ideology except a plea for development. that leaves goa forward party gfp. as far as the gfp is concerned, we are together on the plank of ‘goenkarponn’ or goanness and development. like vijay sardesai, gfp leader says, i also firmly believe in and pursue this goanness. i have no discomfort to adopt and adapt to the word ‘goenkarponn’. because i have always maintained that while the culture of goa is same as that of india, it has a different flavour. i am not saying that it is totally different, but at the same time it is not entirely same. for instance, goan culture of particularly the hindus is very close to the maharashtrian hindu’s culture, yet at the same time it has its difference., goans have traditionally integrated well between communities, they peacefully coexist. goa has a blend of influences, we have all communities represented in our party… all that is goanness. check for yourself., that goenkarponn has to be maintained and protected, no doubt about that. the development agenda, that nobody disputes. now there will be small issues like protecting coconut palm the state government last year had formally derecognised it as a tree, etc. these are small issues, it is not very difficult to address these., it is for the people of goa to think and ponder over the future. they will have to ensure that a single political party gets the mandate in future. if not me, let them give the mandate to congress, i have no issue. a single political party being elected to power is a solution, not a fractured mandate, it cannot be technically accepted and healthy for a long-term solution for goa., i have come, for instance, i may handle this fractured mandate for five years, i am going to do something, fine. can i be there for 50 years? by giving a clear mandate, you develop political parties and culture of stability, and continued fractured mandate leads manipulative politics to develop. what we goans today are suffering is the consequence of repeated fractured mandates. there are too many manipulations, too many compromises have taken place, a lot of adjustments are made when a mandate is fractured., now, i have the ability of doing things within legal limits, ability to get things done, so that is not a big problem. everybody can’t do that, they will go for shortcuts, and that will destroy goa. no hesitation in saying that., even from our party, people should understand — and they have understood — that we have not got a majority, so adjustments and some compromises are inevitable. it is the name of the game., the same argument can be used saying that we got 32.5% votes and they got 28%-plus votes., there is no convention., no, there is no convention. i can give you hundreds of examples… try and understand, where there is no pre-poll alliance, the convention is that the governor or the president normally calls — correct words — the ‘biggest single unit’ for formation of government. but this is subject to the condition that you bring a majority of people with you. not subject to the condition that i will call you and then you form your majority! you have to go with 21 mlas to the governor. you get priority., however, after the election, within 18 hours, by next evening, we took an appointment with the governor at about 4.30 or 5 p.m., we were ready with everything., the congress files a petition in supreme court, the court made it very clear, asked them ‘where is your number?’ you can go to the governor with the number now also. the same day they went to the governor at 1.30 or 2.00 o’clock, again with 17 mlas. so the proof was very clear that they were never beyond 17., see, this is isolation of the congress for their corrupt practices, nepotism and self-centredness. this was isolation of the congress which resulted in their remaining with 17 seats. where is a legal or constitutional aspect involved? the supreme court clearly told us to prove it majority next day in the house, we said we will prove it next day and we did prove it., why? then there would have been no reason for me to come back. why would i come back?, the governor’s speech, followed by my budget, articulates my priorities. one is education, the other is development. we are not compromising. my development idea also has emphasis on cleanliness. garbage-free goa. i will be very strict with sellers and users of plastic bags below 40 microns, for instance. i will give three months and then crack down. let me put solid waste management in place by june. a notification will come effective from july 1, which will prescribe fines of ₹5,000-₹10,000 for littering of the highways also. after june you will see things happening. after september you will be surprised to see the routes and public places without litter. i bet on it., so basically, cleanliness, mobility plan comprehensive public road transport network, and employment. these are the three areas. i want to increase the quality of education. i will do that by drawing on my pan-india exposure and experience of two and a half years as defence minister., i see no reason why you should have any instability factor. it will work on a common programme., i will tell you honestly, i do not see myself as chief minister after five years. so i see no reason for me to terminate this arrangement before five years. you asked me earlier if i would have remained in delhi if we had not formed this government. yes, i would have remained only for this term even in delhi. i am not sure if i will continue beyond this term in politics. eventually you have to take your own call on such matters. i declared long back, i will continue in active politics till the age of 60-65. i have stretched it that much, it is more than enough, i feel. i also believe that people should think of retirement at 65-70 years, based on their health. you should not simply go on and on., in fact now that i have come here, i intend to develop some new leadership within bjp, and otherwise also. at least a leadership which understands the importance of quality, character, ability, integrity and importance of remaining clean., it’s definitely important, the one who will go to the rajya sabha will add to our representation there. the central government is backing us fully. on phone calls i get things done., this is not an issue. it hasn’t been discussed in the party. i have multiple options if i want. it is no issue at all., in my years of political life, i have never compromised on my personal integrity. a lot of people talked that i had a ‘setting’ tacit understanding with former taleigao mla babush monserrate for my elections in panaji over the years. never at all. this time he monserrate moved to panaji and got defeated by the bjp’s candidate, and that speculation stumbled on its face., it is a speculation and rumour that i contacted vijay sardesai ahead of the elections, results, etc. never. frankly, it is vijay who contacted me and, of course, i responded., i don’t see anything wrong. it is like this. instead of raking up the past and presuming that a person will do something wrong, let the person perform and if he does not, or goes off track, well, you have the right to criticise him. he is quite a capable person., it was a very important portfolio, neglected for 10 years, eight years at least to be precise. i feel that i contributed a lot, but instead of bragging myself, that i did this, i did that, you can take inputs from outside., what is important is to understand that the army is a different organisation from civilian institutions. when one chooses a career in the army you have to realise that life is rigorous and tough. you are selecting a tougher career. if the police tell me we don’t want to fire, exempt me from that, can it be done?, take the issue of grievances raised by the bsf on social media. people and the media have to understand that they do not come directly under the army, but the ministry of home affairs. still we took cognisance and acted., i have no issues with army or bsf personnel expressing their grievances, but considering their discipline, i feel their using social media to vent their grievances may spell costly for the country vis-à-vis discipline., i am definitely in favour of addressing their grievances, but there should be a different mechanism worked out. my objection is the way that they are being presented. social media cannot be part of grievance redressal., the biggest challenge was that there was no decision-making. no decisions were taken. i made them positive and they were encouraged and started taking decisions., all these have been brought closer. it will go through. i almost got it to the last stage. maybe some minor changes could be there, but i hope it will go through., for instance, the rafale deal, it was moving in circles, it would have never come out of it. i convinced everyone that it is in the interest of the forces, reduced the price by ₹14,000 crore at least and everyone got convinced, and they supported me and the deal was cleared. the problem is they are worried about the problems like cbi, other agencies who come., very much, obviously, it is your integrity also which counts everywhere. it is not only in defence. when a person of integrity tells something, people know that it is not in your personal interest but in the larger interest of the nation., i do not find it appropriate to discuss this. whatever circumstances that evolved, i took the best decision.",0.032485438558355235,compromises happen mandate fractured : manohar parrikar,"manohar parrikar , reluctant politician delhi durbar , manohar parrikar back always

2017-12-23,reading rahul gandhi’s hand,"until a few months ago, a politician could speak of a ‘congress-mukt bharat’ and expect to be taken seriously. it was an eventuality that seemed both possible and probable. a few days after the gujarat election results, it would seem that the spectre of a ‘congress-mukt bharat’ has been exorcised for the time being., one could discern four factors behind the upswing in the congress’s fortunes in gujarat, and these may well constitute the core ingredients for a pan-india revival too., the first is rahul gandhi’s comfort level in a leadership role. never before has he looked as relaxed and confident as he did leading from the front in gujarat. for long he has been mocked as a bumbling neophyte lacking the commitment necessary for the rigours of electoral politics. but as he travelled across gujarat, addressing nearly 30 rallies, gone was the diffident dilettante mouthing ghost-written speeches. instead, what the people saw was a politician who was earnest, did not act like the entitled dynast he was said to be, and was eager to listen., also readwhat the congress could do , what the congress could do, the second is mr. gandhi’s capacity for self-effacement, which enabled him to bring together competing political egos for a larger cause. hardik patel, alpesh thakor and jignesh mevani are massively popular, ambitious youth leaders representing different constituencies and whose political agendas are often mutually contradictory. what united them under the auspices of the congress was their readiness to trust mr. gandhi. it is difficult to think of another congress politician who could have pulled off this remarkable social coalition — remarkable because it was based not on a cynical caste calculus but on substantive issues such as employment, educational opportunities, unfair taxation, land rights, and agrarian distress., the third element, unlike the others, is a work in progress: organisational presence on the ground. the congress mostly managed this by drawing on pre-existing mobilisations such as the patidar movement. but one instance where it came a cropper was surat. the textile city had become the epicentre of anti-bharatiya janata party (bjp) anger in gujarat. but the crowds that turned up for mr. patel’s rallies in surat did not translate into votes. the congress’s near-absence at the ground level and the bjp’s superiority in booth management and financial firepower made all the difference as the latter swept the city, winning 15 of the 16 seats. the surat phenomenon is bound to repeat itself unless mr. gandhi fixes the rot in the middle and lower rungs of the party and turns them into reliable cogs in the organisational machinery., last, and most critical to the congress’s electoral prospects, is the articulation of an alternative politics that is credible, imaginative, and connects with the masses. and it is here that mr. gandhi has surprised everyone., his speech after taking over as congress president offered the clearest glimpse to date into his vision of politics. though not a full-fledged narrative, the outline suggested by his pronouncements has the potential to serve as an alternative pole of mobilisation and affective investment., by now, the contrast between mr. gandhi and prime minister narendra modi is apparent to all. in terms of stature, popularity, charisma, and accomplishments, the former is a david up against goliath. but david may have found a way to make the contrast work in his favour., if mr. modi exudes power and authority, mr. gandhi personifies a low-key civility. if one evokes admiration and awe, the other has the ability to inspire affection. if one is a great speaker, the other presents himself as a great listener. interestingly enough, of late mr. gandhi has shown a penchant for expanding these sets of binaries in a manner that further sharpens the contrast between himself and mr. modi., also readcongress begins analyses of gujarat

versus a politics of anger; brotherhood versus hatred; truth versus falsehood; dialogue versus monologue; listening versus speechifying; arrogance versus humility; pluralism versus uniformity; diversity versus homogeneity; and above all, a politics of kindness versus a politics of fear., his speeches in gujarat were riffs on these themes interspersed with caustic commentary on the gujarat model, ‘vikas’, the rafale deal, demonetisation, the goods and services tax, and so on. however, he astonished everyone by insisting that though the bjp wanted a ‘congress-mukt bharat’, he did not want a ‘bjp-mukt bharat’ since the bjp was also an expression of the aspirations of the indian people. though he did not agree with their politics, his love, he said, extended to bjp supporters as well. these are shockingly unusual sentiments in the dog-eat-dog world of indian politics., so much so that even the nehruvian liberals are bamboozled. after all, what kind of a modern politician talks of love? love? who votes for love and kindness in the age of gratuitous social media cruelty? has he gone crazy?, less puzzling and more unsettling has been his infamous ‘temple run’ in gujarat.

of vermilion on his forehead and his silence on minority issues., also readbigger battles ahead for congress , bigger battles ahead for congress, this is a misreading, not unexpected from a

more communally polarised than it was in 2009, and gujarat more so than any other state, with religious identity overriding all else at the time of voting. the congress has little chance of winning elections unless it reverses this mass ‘hinduisation’ or neutralises it at election time., ejecting communal toxins from the body politic is a long-term project, best pursued as a social movement or

2018-04-18,managing an election," , while the major contenders on the political scene in karnataka — the congress, the bharatiya janata party (bjp), and the janata dal (secular) or jd(s) — are yet to release their manifestos, the full-blast campaign that they have unleashed has made it amply clear that their priority does not lie in mounting a programme and seeking their mandate, and eventually accountability on that ground, but merely in winning the elections., they have a set of tactics up their sleeves to win, and have chosen to reinforce traditional modes of politicking, by employing new techniques and imagery of communication. elections, far from being an occasion to reformulate and reorder common interests, have become in their hands an endorsement to govern yet for another term. they are turned into sophistries of managing castes and communities, sound bites, image-projection and communication skills, and garnering resources for the same. there are no differences between political parties with regard to these indicators, although their capacity to deploy them and tap resources hugely varies., apart from projecting their respective parties and leadership as being immensely upright, efficient, fair, development-prone and non-partisan, political parties have attempted to reach out to the symbolic wealth of communities and castes, promised bounties to agitating farmers, held discussions with key constituencies such as business leaders and the youth, organised mammoth public rallies, and conducted padayatras and road shows. the siddaramaiah regime has resorted to extensive, and probably expensive, use of print and electronic media to advertise its achievements, the bjp and the jd(s) being a poor second and third in this regard so far. while the bjp is known for its astute use of media and image-crafting, it seems to have been busy so far in a reconnaissance exercise to tone up its party in the state, and its performance in this regard hitherto cannot hold a mirror up to what it would do in the next few days prior to voting scheduled on may 12., one saw bjp president amit shah prostrating before the 110-year-old revered shri shivakumara swamiji of siddaganga mutt in tumkur. as for congress president rahul gandhi, his body language expressed a degree of comfort while visiting the great shankara mutt at sringeri, given the long association of the family with the advaita tradition of shankaracharya, but he seemed ill at ease at several other shrines. while swami nirmalanandji of the adichunchanagiri mutt is known to be close to yogi adityanath, the chief minister of uttar pradesh, and mr. shah, who was one of the first to call on him as part of his electoral rounds, mr. gandhi was not too far behind. chief minister siddaramaiah also employed the long-term demand of the veerashaiva lingayats for a separate religious tag to win over a section by recommending this demand to the centre through a cabinet resolution. the bjp shouted hoarse, but everything seemed fair in the electoral war., there was some tactical innovation too. mr. gandhi bonded with top state leaders of the congress over pakodas and vadas at roadside tea stalls, and fish delicacies on the coast. there was widespread use of selfies including at namma metro. the bjp, attuned to sterner patriarchal ways, however, took the bait, by making its chief ministerial candidate live in slums for a day or two, travel short distances in an auto rickshaw and eat in dalit households. h.d. kumaraswamy, the jd(s) chief ministerial aspirant, responded to the plebian icing of his counterparts by projecting himself as ‘kumaranna’, the protective big brother, and resorted to a highly personalised style of campaigning. such rehearsed gestures are at variance with the everyday life of the top political leaders of this country. however, they have their value in connecting to people, but as independent variables have little to offer in reinforcing participation in the ongoing life of a democratic polity or enhancing the quality of the life of people., the political rhetoric mounted by the congress revolved around demonetisation, goods and services tax, the rafale deal, bank fraud, and the creeping authoritarianism of the narendra modi-amit shah duo, vis-à-vis the performance of the siddaramaiah regime. it also accused the jd(s) of being the bjp’s b-team. the bjp charged mr. siddaramaiah’s government with corruption, minority partisanship, insensitivity to farming distress, divisive approach with regard to the lingayat legacy and donning the false mask of religiosity. mr. kumaraswamy tended to focus on the great record of his family in politics, promising a shift of policy to agrarian concerns. this political rhetoric, however, has made little headway in grappling with the great challenges that confront the state., if we employ public reasoning as a lens, regional disparity clearly emerges as the most stark issue. a vast region of the state comprising bidar, kalaburagi, yadgir, vijayapura, bagalkot, raichur, koppal, gadag and ballari districts suffers from overdetermined deprivation. these districts were peripheral to colonial provinces or centres of princely states; are part of the rain-shadow belt; and register less than half of the average human development index of bengaluru and coastal karnataka. with landless labourers forming an average 40% of rural households, many households have to opt for seasonal migration to neighbouring regions to survive. there is a higher concentration of scheduled castes, scheduled tribes and muslims in this region. it is also caught in the vicious circle of patron-client relationships, under the tutelage of the ‘big’ man, the ‘dora’ or ‘sahukar’., at the same time, this is also the cultural heartland of the state: great dynasties such as the chalukyas, the bahmanis, the adil shahis and the vijayanagar empire flourished here; the urdu language was nurtured and sufism found a pervasive presence. it is in this region that the kannada language and script came into their own; basavanna’s linga worship took root and vachana literature flourished; and the great dasa sahitya and carnatic music found an early home. the inclusion of much of this region under article 371(j) has brought only a notional flow of resources to the region. it looks for a major

2018-08-03,a basis for opposition unity ,"when the congress’s newly reconstituted working committee, which met for the first time on july 22, announced its intent to pitch rahul gandhi as the opposition’s prime ministerial face, it got a reality check from one of its most steadfast allies, the rashtriya janata dal (rjd). the rjd scion, tejashwi yadav, declared that opposition parties will decide on this collectively., shortly after mr. yadav’s statement, the congress too clarified that it was not averse to anyone else becoming prime minister so long as it’s not someone backed by the sangh parivar. this marks a significant shift, with implications for opposition unity., there are two streams of opinion on opposition unity: the optimists and the sceptics. the optimists believe that given the imminent danger of india becoming a hindu rashtra where the space for democratic politics would be all but extinguished, opposition unity is inevitable because it is a matter of political survival for every party that is not the bjp., the sceptics, however, are convinced that attempts at opposition unity are doomed to collapse under the weight of political contradictions and colliding ambitions. what’s more, the weakest link of any such anti-bjp front, they point out, would be the congress itself, which has so far failed to offer a meaningful alternative to the ideological challenge posed by the bjp., the sceptics have a point. opposition unity as an electoral tactic may work up to a point. but without a coherent political proposition, there is nothing to distinguish it from mere opportunism. and so far, the congress has failed to offer anything more than opportunistic attacks on prime minister narendra modi’s various blunders — from demonetisation to the implementation of the goods and services tax, and the rafale deal. the idea seems to be to hammer away at his failures and hope that anti-incumbency does the rest., mere anti-bjp-ism or anti-modi-ism is just not good enough — either to hold the opposition together, or to defeat the bjp in 2019. to stand a fighting chance of achieving either, the alliance must address a genuine political need gap, and in the current juncture, the most obvious one is the absence of a platform at the national level for constituencies whose interests cannot be seriously represented by the bjp, given the constraints of the politics it espouses. these constituencies are the social and geographical inverse of the bjp’s core electoral base, which consists of the savarnas (forward castes) and the urban middle and upper classes, primarily from the hindi-speaking belt., assuming that the base of material interests and social stratification determine the superstructure of democratic politics, an oppositional front capable of challenging the bjp-rss combine — without ending up in the cul de sac of soft hindutva — would have to be a coalition that brings together two related but distinct constellations: parties that represent non-savarna communities (dalit-bahujan-adivasis), and regionalist parties., traditionally, india’s hindi-speaking savarna elite have either directed or demarcated the politics of the national parties, including the left front. but its hegemonic relationship with non-savarna and regional interests has so far been tempered by the constitution, the very document that is now in danger of being undermined. the constitution offers two principles for navigating this hegemony democratically — social justice and federalism — both of which the modi government has observed more in the breach, as evidenced by the disaffection among its allies., while the lok janshakti party had threatened to join the anti-government dalit protests scheduled for august 9, the telugu desam party (tdp) and the peoples democratic party are already out of the nda. another regional ally, the shiv sena, has threatened to go it alone in 2019. clearly, there are limits to how much the bjp can accommodate non-savarna and regional interests at the national level., the congress, too, suffers from the same limitation, and this is one of the factors behind its interminable decline. the savarnas have historically had the biggest stakes in the national project and the indian state, and have also been its biggest beneficiaries. it is thus no coincidence that not a single one of the non-savarna parties — including those that have a national status, such as the bahujan samaj party — have a national footprint. nor is it accidental that only the regionalist parties could resist the bjp juggernaut in 2014. and again, it is not surprising that four years of mr. modi’s rule have seen a steady shift in the balance of power between the centre and the states in favour of the former. every regional party knows that this shift will get institutionalised if the current regime remains in power., in this scenario, the question of who would be the opposition’s prime ministerial face has given the congress an ideal opening to present itself as the only platform where regional and non-savarna agendas can be credibly articulated at the national level. in fact, if mr. gandhi were to proactively withdraw from the prime ministerial race, it could help in three ways. first, it would prove wrong mr. modi’s contention that mr. gandhi is in a tearing hurry to occupy the prime minister’s chair. apart from blunting the usual barbs about dynastic politics, it would lend credibility to mr. gandhi’s image of a reluctant politician whose decision to enter the electoral fray is rooted not in a lust for power but in idealism., second, it would create a welcoming space in the alliance for parties that dislike the bjp but would rather go it alone than play second fiddle in someone else’s pre-poll orchestra., third, from a long-term perspective, this is the only viable strategy for a congress revival at a time when it’s getting squeezed out in state after state. in a way, this entails a return to the template of the old ‘congress system’, in which conflicting interests were accommodated under a capacious pluralistic umbrella. but unlike in the past, this time around ‘the congress system’ would need to break free of the savarna elite that still controls the party. it needs to mould itself into a national pivot for non-savarna and regional interests that now feel compelled to ally with whichever party is in power at the centre — regardless of how repugnant they may find its politics — if they wish to secure even their basic entitlements. some, like the tdp, which seems to have recently discovered that even this doesn’t work, are sure to be interested in alternatives.",0.060091991341991335,basis opposition unity,"congress

2018-08-24,who wants white papers when videos will do?,"in a new video, former film and tv star pallavi joshi sips a cup of tea, looking resplendent in a magenta silk kurta, and proceeds to explain the rafale deal. she uses the analogy of a building society buying high-end door locks to clarify the fighter aircraft deal for all of us idiot citizens. this is indeed magnanimous of her, and one is grateful for the crumbs of wisdom she has thrown in the town square., only, who is pallavi joshi?, she is not a minister or civil servant or aide or defence expert or rafale representative. she is an actress. if the government needs to use sitcom actors rather than ministers,and fables rather than facts, to explain billion-dollar defence deals to voters, one wonders why., , this attempt to simplify everything to the point of infantilism is a peculiar disease of our times, and comes hand in hand with the deep suspicion of intellect and learning that we now see everywhere. where ‘books’ are a bad word, and ‘intellectuals’ the target of derision or, worse, gunshots. it is disguised as a revolt against obscure and sterile ivory-tower intellectualism, but is actually a rejection of reason in favour of emotion., the electronic age made acquiring and dispensing information really easy: books, reports, maps, data and facts are just a keyboard click away. knowledge has been democratised to an unprecedented degree; we no longer need teachers doling out arcane factoids to chosen ones., this democratisation is welcome, of course it is. who doesn’t want everyone to have information, literally, at their fingertips? what’s less welcome but inevitable is that, after a point, it is no longer democracy but mobocracy., data and facts, once so carefully mined, evaluated and presented by experts, can now come, unchecked, from anyone. and since mobocracy demands that the mob be placed above all else, there is simultaneously a debunking of traditional sources of information — institutions, scholars, journalists, media houses., so, if the message is simple enough and packaged in some sort of mock-serious fashion — such as this video — and comes not from any recognised source of authentic research or study, but purportedly from the ‘people’, then it automatically becomes the ‘truth’. as you can see from this response to joshi’s video:, “who’s worried... we public happy with explanation… according to me indian media is irrelevant… we are getting info faster honestly directly from govt…”, this is why mr modi doesn’t address press conferences. he tweets instead. and the mob imagines he is conveying the ‘truth’ directly to them. the mob, with its not-so-distant social memory of mai-baap rulers sequestered in palaces, feels privileged and empowered to be addressed so intimately by the ruling class. every person on twitter feels he or she has been singled out for a confidential sharing of top-secret info and laps it up eagerly and, more importantly, unquestioningly. that in-between filter — the scholar or data-cruncher or journalist — would have asked questions, the mob won’t. all it wants is a story. which the government is happy to provide. why bother with white papers when filmy videos will do?, the yen for simplification stems also from wanting to go back to a ‘perfect’ past, when men were strong and women stayed indoors and the young obeyed the old. dissent, feminism, rationalism, secularism — all these are seen as serpents in eden., science, once prized, is now regularly rejected in favour of puerile superstition. so, as the kerala flood raged, you have mr s gurumurthy, chartered accountant and part-time director of the rbi, commenting that it could be a fallout of the sabarimala controversy. this clearly amounts to spreading disinformation to create public panic, but it’s the sort of simplistic moral lesson that’s all the rage today.",0.12138830162085976,wants white papers videos ?,"new video , former film tv star pallavi joshi sips cup tea , looking resplendent magenta silk kurta , proceeds explain rafale deal. uses analogy building society buying high-end door locks clarify fighter aircraft deal us idiot citizens. indeed magnanimous , one grateful crumbs wisdom thrown town square. , , pallavi joshi?

2018-08-27,silence is not a virtue ,"it was heartening to read all the glowing tributes to veteran journalist kuldip nayar and his relentless fight for a free press. the irony is that some of those who do not value the importance of a free press are celebrating his resistance to the emergency. in the mid-1970s, the threat to media freedom was transparent as it was a top-down command. now, it has taken myriad forms and operates in a subtle fashion. it is akin to a byzantine maze., one of the key tools used to silence a probing press, whose fundamental mandate is to scrutinise those in power, is the prepublication gag order. in recent times, gag orders have been coming as an avalanche. they are in gross violation of the supreme court’s 1994 order in r. rajagopal v. state of tamil nadu. the bench comprising justices b.p. jeevan reddy and s.c. sen categorically denied the option of prior restraint. the apex court observed that it was important to strike a balance between the freedom of the press and the right to privacy. the court said that the state and its officials do not have the right to impose prior restraints on the publication of materials that may be defamatory to the state. “no such prior restraint or prohibition of publication can be imposed by the respondents upon the proposed publication,” the court said, but this does not prevent the state from initiating legal proceedings if it finds the published material to be defamatory. in other words, the ruling meant that no one can prevent the publication of potentially defamatory articles; one can only sue after such articles are published. but what constitutes defamation? why should india permit both criminal and civil defamation? legal experts have explored these contentious issues at length., there seems to be a wide gap in the interpretation and application of laws between the higher judiciary and the lower judiciary in india. while the higher judiciary retains the space for freedom of expression, the lower judiciary tends to restrict it on untested legal grounds, often bordering on infringement of fundamental rights. for instance, in karnataka, nearly 80 cases of blanket prior injunctions were issued against various media houses, including this newspaper. it takes months, if not years, to get these injunctions vacated. it is not just governments that opt for prior restraint to silence the media and hamper the flow of information but also powerful corporate houses., last year, the news website the wire was forced to take down two articles following a court order in a defamation suit filed by rajya sabha member rajeev chandrasekhar, who is also the vice chairman of the national democratic alliance in kerala. the city civil court in bengaluru gave an ex parte order in the case without even giving the news organisation an opportunity to explain its reason for publishing the material., in september 2016, a €7.87 billion intergovernmental agreement for 36 rafale multi-role fighter jets in fly-away condition was signed between india and france. the deal has become a contentious issue since. it is the duty of the media to examine the deal closely, including the controversial offset deal. however, three companies owned by anil ambani served a “cease and desist” notice to the the hindu against publishing “unverified and speculative” reports relating to the offset contract that was part of the rafale deal. the notice comes after the congress alleged that there were financial irregularities in the intergovernmental agreement. the party had also raised questions about the manner in which the companies were roped in as offset (export obligation) partners for the deal. the “cease and desist” notice was later sent to some other publications and to congress leaders.",0.05456349206349205,silence virtue,"heartening read glowing tributes veteran journalist kuldip nayar relentless fight free press. irony value importance free press celebrating resistance emergency. mid-1970s , threat media freedom transparent top-down command. , taken myriad forms operates subtle fashion. akin byzantine maze. , one key tools used silence probing press , whose fundamental mandate scrutinise power , prepublication gag order. recent times , gag orders coming avalanche. gross violation supreme court ’ 1994 order r. rajagopal v. state tamil nadu. bench comprising justices b.p. jeevan reddy s.c. sen categorically denied option prior restraint. apex court observed important strike balance freedom press right privacy. court said state officials right impose prior restraints publication materials may defamatory state. “no prior restraint prohibition publication imposed respondents upon proposed publication , ” court said , prevent state initiating legal proceedings finds published material defamatory. words , ruling meant one prevent publication potentially defamatory articles ; one sue articles published. constitutes defamation ?

2018-10-26,hal: the backbone of the indian air force ,"hal is ranked in the 34 position amongst the top 100 global aerospace industries. | photo credit: k. murali kumar , hindustan aeronautics ltd or hal as it is known from its initials, turned 78 this year and has always been the backbone of the indian air force. two-thirds of the iaf's workhorse aircraft are from hal. today, hal manufactures the light combat aircraft (lca) tejas with advanced technologies; and the 25-tonne sukhoi-30 mki fourth generation fighter aircraft of russian origin right from raw materials., as a nation we have to be proud of these accomplishments. unfortunately, in recent weeks, hal has been unduly blamed and - it seems - systematically tarnished on the basis of myths, wrong notions and false charges., in the area of design, hal has to its credit the indigenous design of glider, basic piston engine trainers (ht-2, hpt32), jet trainers (kiran mk i and mk ii), supersonic fighter (marut), agricultural aircraft (basant). it also has to it’s credit a number of aircraft upgrade programs that it license-manufactured - gnat, jaguar, mirage-2000 and the migs - all of which meet the air force's requirements., design, production and technological capabilities of hal should have been reckoned before it was knocked down as an industry not capable of producing the rafale fighter aircraft. (the government is buying 36 of them in flyaway condition outright from their original french manufacturer dassault aviation.) the fact that two thirds of the aircraft in iaf are from hal is enough testimony to hal’s manufacturing capability., all these years, hal used to be the major partner in the iaf’s induction of new weapon platforms. the government seems to have ignored hal's track record and its contributions while keeping its own company out of the recent programme to acquire a fleet of 36 french-origin rafale fighter planes for the indian air force., hal being knocked out of the the iaf's rafale acquisition programme at the last minute and for reasons best known to the authorities is astonishing. rafales without hal can be likened to a chariot without a horse. a start-up company of any magnitude cannot be a match for hal’s capability that has been built over decades., political battles apart, this action is a matter of serious concern in the larger interest of the nation. it is understood from an article that appeared in the indian express - ""don’t ground the rafale"" -written by former chief of air staff air chief marshal s.krishnaswamy thatthere were two reasons., also readnirmala sitharaman blames hal capability, a.k. antony for upa’s rafale deal failure , nirmala sitharaman blames hal capability, a.k. antony for upa’s rafale deal failure, the first one is the refusal of dassault aviation to take the responsibility for the work-share of hal and further insistence of the iaf on such a guarantee due to what is said was the unsatisfactory performance of hal in the past., the second one is that the estimated man-hours required to produce aircraft at hal are three times the man hours taken at dassault aviation., while the first one is a myth, the second one is based on wrong notions. the actual situation is contrary to what has been presumed and propagated blatantly, as we will see from these examples., while the negotiated price per aircraft is closely guarded under the secrecy clause of the contract, the poor performance wrongly alluded to hal, unfortunately, and has been made a subject of open debate that has harmed its image. this has seriously damaged the indian aviation industry as the image and credibility of its beacon, hal, is under question in the global aviation market. this is an omission of serious nature that warrants immediate corrective measures., also readhas the government lost the perception battle on rafale? , has the government lost the perception battle on rafale? , let us consider the impact of outright purchase of rafales without local manufacture. it would end up in an enormous life cycle cost which may drain out the exchequer. apart from the point of keeping hal's workforce busy, from all other considerations such as self-reliance, ‘make in india' drive, transfer of technology, spares support over the product life cycle of 35-40 years, hal should have been a major partner in the rafale acquisition programme., a brief history of the defence undertaking would be relevant here.itwas started way back in december 1940 by industrialist seth walchand hirachand with the support of an american aviation expert, william douglas pawley, who was the director of the erstwhile harlow aircraft company, california. it was a quantum jump for india at a time when it was not even manufacturing an automobile or a bicycle., hal started off with an attractive order book position to deliver 30 harlow trainer aircraft, 48 hawk fighters and 74 vultee attack bombers in two years. seth walchand and his group swiftly got on to the task. their hunt for a site to set up the factory took them on a tour of the four princely states of baroda, bhavnagar, gwalior and mysore. the maharaja of mysore krishnarajendra wodeyer, a great visionary, on the advice of the then dewan sir mirza ismail, offered free of cost 700 acres of land, supply of electricity and water at concessional rates to start the company in the erstwhile state of mysore. thus began the journey of hal at bengaluru which has now become the aviation hub of the country., the task ahead was formidable and the performance of this start-up company was unbelievable but true. in a short span of two years, the selection of the site, construction of factory and office buildings, recruitment and training of engineers and technicians, procurement of machinery, aircraft components, assembly and testing were all accomplished within the time line. us experts were impressed by the quality and ability of indian personnel who took over the running of the factory very quickly. the spirit with which the organisation was started is still alive today in the third generation of work force of hal., since then, hal has grown from strength to strength. hal is now a flagship aerospace company with 11 research and development centres, 20 production units with a work force of 29,300. hal is ranked in the 34 position amongst the top 100 global aerospace industries. as on date, hal has produced or overhauled 1,416 aircraft (of 17 types) of indigenous design, 2,097 aircraft (of 14 type) under license and a total of 5,015 aero engines., the turnover of the company during 2017-2018 was rs.18,284 crore. in the last five years hal's contribution to the exchequer has been rs.30,429 crores (dividend including taxes paid to the central and state governments) and it has made a (cumulative) profit of rs.16,884 crores., back to the present situation. it is stated that the iaf insisted on a work share guarantee from hal because of what it says was the unsatisfactory performance in the past. this is a myth originating from a rigid mindset that ‘videshi is achha and swadeshi is kachha’. unless this mindset is uprooted, self-reliance in defense aviation will remain a dream forever., during the year 1993, the government constituted a committee on fighter aircraft accident (cofaa) headed by dr. a.p.j abdul kalam, who was then secretary, defence r&d. the committee was to recommend remedial measures to contain fighter aircraft accidents. the data of the technical defect (td) accidents presented in the report clearly brought out that the rate of td accidents (number of accidents per 10,000 hours of flying) on fighters, trainers, helicopters and transport aircraft of hal origin is nearly 50% of the rate of accidents on aircraft of non-hal origin of comparable technology and vintage, (aircraft type-accident rate: mig-27 - 0.50 / mig-23- 0.95; jaguar-0.30 / mig-29 -0.62; kiran - 0.17 / iskara -0.42; cheetah/chetak-0.05 / mi helicopters - 0.18), it established beyond doubt that hal-made aircraft have been superior in quality and performance to those purchased directly from the oem. in view of this, dassault's demand for work share guarantee does not hold any water., apart from the statistical data culled out from cofaa report, the following cases recalled from the writer's experience should bring out some of the facts and bust the myths clouding hal., (a) ground flame-out of r-11 engines:in a span of one month there were 12 incidents of ground flame outs. hal was blamed for poor quality of overhaul. it was established that maintenance lapse resulting in fuel contamination was the cause., (b) inability to recover from nosedive position -type 77 aircraft: there were two accidents of type-77 aircraft in quick succession where pilots were unable to move the stabilizer servo booster from the nosedive position and they ejected safely. quality of overhaul at nasik division was subjected to scrutiny. it was established that these accidents were due to omission of routine check on inlet filter. maintenance lapse was the cause for these accidents., (c) failure of 4th stage compressor disk of r-29 engine of mig-27 aircraft: bursting of 4th stage compressor disc on ground was yet another case where a shadow was cast on the quality of discs manufactured at hal. the russian experts while giving clean chit to the quality of discs manufactured at hal, established the failure to the skipping of an operational drill during taxing. the problem was eliminated after following this procedure. these accidents were due to operational laps., (d) fatal accident of avro aircraft: there was a fatal accident of avro aircraft (hs-748) where the crew and air force band of 28 died. there were indications of ‘fire warning’ and ‘auto feathering of propeller’ prior to the accident. iaf sentenced the quality of engine overhaul.hal was not in agreement as many of the tell-tales on the aircraft were contrary to this theory. hal independently referred the case to b.ae with a brief narrative of the sequence of accident and the conclusions of the coi for their independent opinion. m/s b.ae promptly replied that the accident had not happened the way it has been visualized by coi. accident was due to maintenance and operation lapse, (e)jaguar accident / incident due to failure of hydraulic system: there were two identical failures of hydraulic system of jaguar aircraft in quick succession where the pilots could not lower the under carriages for landing. this was an emergency where the pilot had to abandon the aircraft. the first one culminated in an accident. iaf sentenced that quality lapse during aircraft overhaul as the cause for the accident. m/s b.ae after investigating the second incident sentenced iaf for the operational and maintenance lapses resulting in these failures. independent investigation carried out by hal established that the component failure was caused due to ‘low cycle-high load’ fatigue. after initial reservation, m/s b.ae accepted that the cause was due to design deficiency in the brake body of the combat slat motor. finally, m/s b.ae was held blame worthy which was accepted., there are many more examples to the case. summing up, in all the five cases cited above, maintenance, operational lapses and poor quality of the component supplied by oem were the cause for unsatisfactory performance and not the hal quality as made out in the first instance.　, hal has also been blamed for the `high' man-hours - thrice that of the oem - that it requires to bring out an aircraft. when we compare the man-hours taken by the oem and a licensed manufacturer to produce an aircraft, comparisons cannot be between oranges and apples. if self-reliance is the primary objective, the key should be the acquisition of ‘technology’ while cost should not be a mandate. in any major programme of the type and size of the rafale, tot is of paramount importance. decisions based on comparison of only man-hours / cost will lead us on the wrong path and set us back., comparison of the man hours of the oem and the licensed manufacturer would not be fair. back home in france, dassault aviation would have outsourced a good percentage of the work content and therefore its man-hours would be relatively less. it is also a fact that industrial productivity in tropical countries is lower than their western counterparts., since hal is anyway required to give the fixed price quotation for each batch of aircraft on order, iaf will have the benefit of reduced man-hours due to a learning phenomenon on the production order., more important than the productivity is the life cycle cost. the oem's cost of spares support over the product life cycle over 30-40 years is bound to drain the operator. there is no doubt that hal's pricing will be cost-effective over the life of the rafales., in the package procurement of 36 rafales, if dassault aviation has promised 75% serviceability of the fleet, it should be taken with a pinch of salt. serviceability of the fleet is the joint responsibility of the operator (iaf) and the oem. the role of the operator in ensuring the expected level of serviceability is much bigger than that of the oem. if a lower serviceability is attributed to operational and maintenance lapses, the oem will disown its commitment. these aspects need careful consideration., the original 2007 rfp (request for proposal) for buying 126 mmrcas (medium multi-role combat aircraft) had a condition: that `the oem (dassault aviation) must take the responsibility for hal's share of work and iaf has further insisted on such a guarantee from the oem on the impression of unsatisfactory performance of hal in the past’. such a condition based on misconceptions has caused serious damage to hal. it has gone against the basic objective of self-reliance in defence aviation and the most ambitious scheme of ‘make in india’.",0.044091343954148834,hal : backbone indian air force,"hal ranked 34 position amongst top 100 global aerospace industries. &#124; photo credit : k.
