2010-10-29,adarsh scam: high command summons chavan,"maharashtra chief minister ashok chavan, who is in the eye of a real estate storm, has been summoned to delhi by the congress high command. confirming this to the hindu, highly placed congress sources said mr. chavan had been asked to meet party president sonia gandhi on saturday., the summons came amidst speculation in congress circles that mr. chavan might be asked to step down as chief minister as his name has surfaced in the controversy surrounding the adarsh housing society, a 31-storey high-rise building in colaba, one of the most expensive parts of mumbai. but it also came hours after mr. chavan, at a press conference in mumbai, ruled out quitting as chief minister, stressing that the allegations against him were “politically motivated” and that there was nothing wrong in some of his “distant relatives” owning flats in the building., earlier in the day, the congress had distanced itself from mr. chavan: “we are not holding any brief for anyone who might be responsible,” party spokesman manish tewari said on friday, adding, “we do not want to shield anyone's misdemeanour or indiscretion...let us await the outcome of the enquiry.”, he was responding to questions whether mr. chavan would be asked to step down, given that the names of his late mother-in-law bhagwati manoharlal sharma, as well as two other relatives, had come up as beneficiaries in the adarsh housing society., mr. tewari pointed out that defence minister a.k. antony, who is also in charge of the congress affairs in maharashtra, had already stated that the matter would be investigated and “instant action” taken if someone was found responsible., for the congress, already embroiled in the commonwealth games scam and the spectrum allocation mess, the new scandal could not have come at a worse moment, especially as mr. chavan was the state revenue minister when the clearances were given for this housing society., the winter session of parliament begins on november 9, and these issues are sure to provide fodder for the political rivals, congress managers fear., however, party sources stressed that the question of “political accountability” would arise only after the facts of the case were established by the enquiry. this would include, these sources said, whether the adarsh housing complex had come up on defence or maharashtra government land, whether the land was acquired legally, whether the allotments were made as per the eligibility rules of the housing society and finally, through whom the file clearing this housing complex had been passed and whether that person's relatives benefited., mr. chavan has since said that the land belonged to the maharashtra government and that the flats were not intended for kargil war heroes and their families., the central bureau of investigation is already investigating how defence land was transferred to the adarsh society and how the beneficiaries, including former services chiefs, politicians and bureaucrats, raised money to buy apartments meant for kargil war heroes and their families., originally meant to be a six-storey structure to house kargil war heroes and widows, it was later converted into a 31-storey tower, apparently in violation of environmental laws.",-0.006564213564213564,adarsh scam : high command summons

2010-11-09,tracking the trail of manipulation,"pandora's box: a view of adarsh housing society apartments in mumbai. clearly, the adarsh scam involves enough manipulation to warrant a thorough probe. | photo credit: rajanish kakade , it is hard to imagine that a scam which surfaced seven years ago would rebound to rock the maharashtra government leading to the resignation of the chief minister. it was in august 2003 that journalist samar halarnkar broke in the indian express the story of the adarsh cooperative housing society. he wrote about connections among a motley group: “what might the chief of naval staff, a shiv sena mlc, a promoter under cbi investigation, ias officers, a local army commander and ‘kargil heroes' have in common?”, at that time, no answers on the allotment of land were forthcoming from chief minister sushilkumar shinde. his office claimed that it must have been done by his predecessor, vilasrao deshmukh. no chief minister came under a cloud then. news reports even indicated later that adarsh was not a society for defence personnel, and that its promoter, r.c. thakur, then a junior officer with the defence estates agency, was under investigation by the central bureau of investigation (cbi) over a land deal., in september 1999, when narayan rane was the chief minister (he was then with the shiv sena), the society made its pitch for land on the foreshore area of colaba. the proposal was revived when mr. deshmukh was the chief minister, in february 2000. after this, the district collector asked the general officer commanding (goc), maharashtra, gujarat and goa, if the land in question was defence land., mr. chavan, while clarifying this to the media, said the goc had replied on april 5, 2000 that the land was outside the defence area. the society got a formal letter of intent on january 18, 2003, and the land was finally allotted to adarsh — it had only 20 members then — by a letter of july 9, 2004 when shivajirao nilangekar patil was the revenue minister and mr. shinde who replaced vilasrao deshmukh, was chief minister., mr. chavan has denied he had ever met the promoters of adarsh or had anything to do with civilians being accommodated in the society. but a letter obtained by the national alliance of peoples' movements (napm) under the right to information act disproves the claim. that letter, dated june 2, 2000, signed by the chief promoter and addressed to mr. chavan, then the revenue minister, stated: “further to our letter dated 3.1.2000 and personal meeting in your chamber with office bearers of our society on 2.6.2000, we wish to submit the following for your consideration: that we are agreeable to accommodate civilian members (members from outside the defence services) in our society to the extent of 40 per cent …”, this letter mentioned the society as one meant for kargil heroes. it made a plea to mr. chavan for the allotment of land: “as already submitted, we need your kind help to accommodate and reward our heroes of kargil operation who bravely fought at kargil to protect our mother land. we have many officers in the society who participated in the said operation ‘vijay'.”, however, of the total of 103 flats, 37 are for defence personnel and only three of them have any connection with the kargil operation., well before all this, on august 19, 1999, suresh joshi, principal secretary to the state urban development department, sent a letter to the union ministry of environment and forests (moef) enclosing a copy of the society's letter dated august 2, 1999, along with a location plan received from the chief promoter of the adarsh society. in that letter the society made a request “to permit development of the foreshore land admeasuring 10,000 sq. metres for residential purposes.”, mr. joshi wrote that from the plan submitted, the land was situated on the seaward side of existing residential development. he quoted the chief promoter who had mentioned that the moef had cleared for development a similar site situated about 500 metres south of the land in question. he advocated the land allotment by saying: “the members of the society are the officers from defence services who have dedicated their lives in the service of motherland and deserve all special consideration and several members of the society are even today fighting at kargil and surrounding areas.”, from this it is evident that when the proposal was first submitted in 1999, the society was mentioned as one meant for army officials or people fighting the kargil operation and their families. this was the pretext for giving adarsh so many concessions. a letter written by p.v. deshmukh, deputy secretary, urban development department was crucial; he owns a flat in adarsh. this letter to the chief engineer of the brihanmumbai municipal corporation, dated march 15, 2003, stated the modification made to the development plan of the mumbai backbay reclamation area under section 37(2) of the maharashtra regional and town planning act, 1966 as regards the change in width of the prakash pethe marg: it was modified to 18.440 m from 60.97 m by a notification dated april 10, 2002. the area so deleted was included partly in the residential zone, a parade ground, a helipad and a bus depot of best, or the brihanmumbai electric supply and transport undertaking. adarsh society also got additional floor space index (fsi) from the adjoining bus depot in 2005., the letter said the matter was referred to the moef since it fell within crz 2 area that is subject to moef conditions. the government asked the moef for permission on january 4, 2003, and the letter claimed that the moef had communicated its ‘no objection' to allow residential development since the area fell in crz 2. (the moef denied this recently.), as recently as on october 29, 2010, the state urban development department finally replied to a query from the state environment department to say that the society had violated coastal regulation zone rules., the society said it had moef approval as per a letter of march 11, 2003 and that the building plans were approved by the mumbai metropolitan region development authority (mmrda), which also granted it an occupation certificate on september 16, 2010 — which now stands revoked. the height of the building, 103.4 m., was approved by the high rise committee headed by a retired chief justice of the madras high court, the society said. (such approval is required for structures beyond 22 floors based on the availability of fsi.) in 2007, the municipal corporation approved the high rise committee's decision allowing adarsh to build up to 97.6 m. the maximum height permissible is 30 m. last year the building was permitted to go even higher, and the proposal was cleared by the mmrda., decisions were made and even reservations were changed to suit the adarsh project. for instance, the land use category of the plot was changed from ‘transit camp' and ‘parade ground' to ‘residential zone.' in the trail of the scam it is evident that any bureaucrat or politician who had anything to do with clearance being granted to the project benefited from it: they got flats worth rs. 2 crore to rs. 8 crore in a prime location on mumbai's coast. former shiv sena mlc kanhaiyalal gidwani, who is now with the congress, owns three flats here, one in his name and two in his sons' names. there are strenuous denials from politicians and the former chief ministers, mr. rane, mr. deshmukh and mr. shinde, who had allegedly recommended names for membership in adarsh or cleared related files.",0.10175536881419237,tracking trail manipulation,"pandora ' box : view adarsh housing society apartments mumbai. clearly , adarsh scam involves enough manipulation warrant thorough probe. &#124; photo credit : rajanish kakade , hard imagine scam surfaced seven years ago would rebound rock maharashtra government leading resignation chief minister. august 2003 journalist samar halarnkar broke indian express story adarsh cooperative housing society. wrote connections among motley group : “what might chief naval staff , shiv sena mlc , promoter cbi investigation , ias officers , local army commander ‘kargil heroes ' common ?

2011-11-15,‘every particle is in a condition of half night',"journalists get constantly told by those who claim to know better to ‘lighten up,' that indian readers are getting younger, they have short attention spans, and they do not want to read gloom and doom stories about india not shining | photo credit: paul noronha , a pakistani columnist once asked me: “what is it with you all? you claim to have a free media and yet, when i was in delhi last year, it took me less than 15 minutes to run through some six or seven papers. they're full of trivia. there's nothing to read in them, not even on the front pages.”, his words came back to me after justice markandey katju's outburst against indian journalism. it is not just the two of them either., some months ago, a well-known delhi-based bharatanatyam dancer told me how “sad” she felt about the indian media scene. she was an aggrieved party: “i cannot understand this,” she said, “no paper will review my performances. they have all done away with their review pages. yet journalists call me all the time to find out what my favourite restaurant is, or what my favourite food is. there is an excessive focus on me, and none on my work.”, let's face it: plenty of journalists too would agree that both indian electronic and print media are obsessed with celebrity and trivia and are given to sensationalism. in fact, journalists have long been concerned — much before the press council chairman voiced his criticism — about the amount of journalistic energies and space/time devoted to the coverage of fluff, and the shallow treatment meted out to what justice katju described as the “real” issues., the impulse to dumb down is only increasing under the pressure of 24x7 news cycles, and as the competition to snare young readers and viewers grows. on television, all news is spectacle, and even the irrelevant gains importance as ‘breaking news.' i remember switching on the television in my hotel room in jaisalmer some years ago, to be greeted by this important breaking news: “jail mey karva chauth” — a report about women prisoners celebrating this north indian festival of wifely piety., journalists get constantly told by those who claim to know better to ‘lighten up,' that indian readers are getting younger, they have short attention spans, and they do not want to read gloom and doom stories about india not shining; if these stories have to be covered, they must be delivered to these attention-deficit readers/viewers in bite-sized pieces; coverage must be about personalities, even if about politicians; the coverage must cater to young, aspirational india's race for upwardly mobile lifestyles rather than the multiple crises in the country, even if these crises will ultimately work towards thwarting those very aspirations., so bring in the beautiful people, go easy on farmers' suicides and rural employment generation. in this model, science journalism cannot get more cerebral than whether mobile phones give you cancer; international news would ideally feature breaking up — or breaking down — teenage pop stars, film stars, and supermodels, and the jasmine revolution would fare better as a new line of perfume, and arab spring a brand of sparkling mineral water that angelina jolie drinks on her unhcr trips., “this is what young people want today” is the market mantra. if that is correct, and we do not know that, the question is, as media — presuming that media are a substantially different entity from a fizzy drink — do we lead our ‘consumers,' or should we allow ourselves to be led by what sections of these consumers consider ‘boring' or ‘interesting'? steve jobs, whose market strategies are much admired by the pundits, is said to have nursed a healthy disrespect for market research, saying “customers don't know what they want until we've shown them.”, dumbing down aside, in the past couple of years, the gory stories of media corruption, paid news, and the radia tapes controversy have all taken the sheen off indian journalism., yet i find myself disagreeing with justice katju's broad swipe. it is easy to tar the entire media with one broad brush of criticism. but not all journalists are the same, just as not all judges are the same. there are many journalists who are doing exactly what justice katju thinks journalists should be doing, and they are not necessarily all high-profile. it also needs to be said that the media have made a lot more positive contribution than they are given credit for. much of the corruption that has come to light over the last one year, all the scams that are currently churning the indian polity, would have gone unnoticed had it not been for exposés by news organisations. just in the last year, the government has had to sack cabinet ministers and chief ministers in response to the great 2g heist, the cwg and the adarsh scams, all of which were unearthed by the media., we are living through a complex period of economic, social and demographic change. even justice katju, in an article inthe hinduon the media that was a forerunner to his interview with karan thapar on cnn-ibn's devil's advocate programme, quoted his favourite firaq gorkahpuri couplet to make this point:har zarre par ek qaifiyat-e-neemshabi hai, ai saaqi-e- dauraan yeh gunahon ki ghadi hai. translating this literally as “every particle is in a condition of half-night; it's a time of sin,” justice katju spoke of the pains of living through an era of transition., it is a nice thought that the media must separate themselves from the flux in which they exist, but the truth is that the media, and the people who work in them, are also a reflection — a snapshot — of society at any particular time. my pakistani columnist friend who complained about the lightness of indian newspapers is used to the steady high-fibre fare of strategic and political analyses offered up in the pakistani papers. but that is a reflection of pakistan's country situation., india's situation is a bit more mixed than that. for that reason, any newspaper or television channel has the challenging job of accommodating a wide variety of interests, and there is no point being in denial about this. at one end is the need to cater to a mass of people who seem to be on an endless buying spree, from cars to clothes and everything in between; at the other, the need to remind them that there are people who cannot buy even one square meal a day. the challenge for media organisations is to get the mix right, without compromising on the essentials of journalism. the world's best newspapers (not necessarily the ones with the largest circulation) are the ones that have mastered this mix., for instance, the visit of the pakistan foreign minister, hina rabbani khar, excited much criticism that the coverage focussed more on her looks, clothes, birken bag, and her glasses than on the substance of her discussions with her indian counterpart, s.m. krishna. from a reporter's perspective, when a minister of a country with a worse human development index than yours lands at your airport with a $10,000 handbag, pricey shades, and “classy pearls,” it is bound to attract media comment. this is not trivialising news. it is news. the criticism that the coverage of her film star looks was excessive and breathless may not be misplaced. but there is nothing startlingly wrong if a newspaper's fashion reporter dissects the pearls, and a foreign affairs reporter covers the substance of the visit, as most mainline newspapers did., yes, it is true that journalists could be better informed about the subjects they cover, and could be possessed of more general knowledge. but that is more a commentary on our education system than on journalism itself. some of the best journalists may not know their shakespeare or emile zola, but that has not been known to affect the quality of their work.",0.10023191094619667,‘every particle condition half night ',"journalists get constantly told claim know better ‘lighten , ' indian readers getting younger , short attention spans , want read gloom doom stories india shining &#124; photo credit : paul noronha , pakistani columnist asked : “what ?

2012-02-17,the iron laws of the earth sciences,"going by the form book, union science and technology minister vilasrao deshmukh is due for a promotion. he's just been mangled by the bombay high court, setting some sort of record for a minister getting roughed up by the higher judiciary. and every time some amazing act of the former sarpanch of babalgaon has landed the government in deep trouble, he's been rewarded, even promoted. the classic instance being prime minister manmohan singh elevating him as union rural development minister soon after a supreme court judgment that would surely have cost most others their job. the apex court had fined mr. deshmukh rs. 10 lakh for stopping a moneylender from being arrested in vidarbha while he was chief minister of maharashtra. unless you see usury at criminal rates of interest as a vital plank of rural progress, dr. singh's logic was hard to follow. and the maharashtra government even paid up the fine for mr. deshmukh., the adarsh scam, in the adarsh scam, mr. deshmukh is one of three former chief ministers under a cloud. as >the hindu (june 18, 2011) reported, he stoutly denied having cleared the file on that sleazy deal on his last day as chief minister. he also rebutted charges of fudging the records. the courts long ago slammed the cbi for its tardy investigation into the adarsh rip-off. that vital files keep vanishing has not helped the baffled sleuths in their task., last week, the bombayhigh court said vilasrao deshmukh “clearly misused his official position as a chief minister of a state.” this was in connection with a deal struck by the maharashtra film, stage and cultural development corporation while he was chief minister. the deal, a “joint venture,” gave subhash ghai's film training institute, whistling woods, possession of 20 acres of prime real estate at rock bottom rates. “we clearly disapprove the conduct of respondent no. 7 vilasrao deshmukh …”, said the court. it rapped him for the role he played “in the entire proceedings leading to the signing of the jv agreement.” the whole deal, said the outraged court, was “illegal, arbitrary and without authority of law.” but mr. deshmukh's track record defies the laws of gravity, leave alone those of the nation., in december 2010, justice a.k. ganguly of the supreme court admonished mr. deshmukh in scathing terms in the moneylender case. in his judgment, justice ganguly said he found the message it conveyed “extremely shocking and it shocks the conscience of this court about the manner in which the constitutional functionaries behaved in the state of maharashtra.” (justice ganguly is no stranger to shocking things and was more recently on the bench which gave that historic verdict in the 2g scam). the judgment went on to say “it is clear that the chief minister was aware of various complaints being filed against the said family the moneylenders. even then he passed an order for a special treatment in favour of the said family which is unknown to law.”, moneylender case, the judgment noted that mr. deshmukh's action “amounts to bestowing special favour to some chosen few at the cost of the vast number of poor people who, as farmers, have taken loans and who have come to the authorities of law and order to register their complaints against torture and atrocities by the moneylenders.” and so mr. deshmukh set another record. it is hard to recall when a cabinet minister and former chief minister was punished and fined this way by the highest court of the land., prime minister singh's response? he promptly elevated the man blasted for protecting moneylenders in his state to a portfolio that put him in charge of rural development across the whole country., close to 30,000 farmers committed suicide in maharashtra during mr. deshmukh's eight years as chief minister. that is more than half the total of 50,481 farm suicides the state has seen since 1995, according to the national crime records bureau. it was in mr. deshmukh's time that maharashtra emerged the worst state in the country for farmers' suicides. and that, for a decade without a break., farm suicides, before his reign began, karnataka and madhya pradesh were doing a lot worse in some years. today, karnataka, the state with the second highest number of farm suicides in the country, has a total that is 15,000 less than that of maharashtra. in 2006, the height of the deshmukh raj, his state saw 4,453 farmers take their own lives. no other state has ever logged a more heart-breaking figure., but the only blip on mr. deshmukh's record till 2008 had nothing to do with all this. he did lose his chief ministership for 22 months in 2003. but that, as his website puts it, was due to “factionalism in the state unit of the party.” he bounced back stronger with the full backing of the congress at the centre. in the 2004 polls, he promised cotton farmers in both vidarbha and his own marathwada region that he would raise the minimum support price for cotton by rs. 500. he did exactly the opposite on being elected, withdrawing the “advance bonus” of rs. 500 that cotton farmers were receiving till then. the move tanked prices, hit lakhs of farmers and saw distress sweep the cotton countryside., on the farm suicides, mr. deshmukh saw himself as gentle and caring. as he told the hindustan times (october 31, 2007): “committing suicide is an offence under the indian penal code. but did we book any farmer for this offence? have you reported that?” he went down to vidarbha to soothe the offended peasants, in the company of the redoubtable mr. vaghela. his healing touch came in a speech suggesting the farmers were lazy and less than honest and this was the cause of their problems. as outrage spread, he asserted he had been “quoted out of context” (the hindu, september 15, 2007)., in his last three years as chief minister from 2005, the state lost 2 million jobs according to the economic survey of his own government. that is, maharashtra lost on average 1800 jobs every single day. and that was well before the global economic meltdown struck in september 2008.

2012-02-17,the iron laws of the earth sciences,"going by the form book, union science and technology minister vilasrao deshmukh is due for a promotion. he's just been mangled by the bombay high court, setting some sort of record for a minister getting roughed up by the higher judiciary. and every time some amazing act of the former sarpanch of babalgaon has landed the government in deep trouble, he's been rewarded, even promoted. the classic instance being prime minister manmohan singh elevating him as union rural development minister soon after a supreme court judgment that would surely have cost most others their job. the apex court had fined mr. deshmukh rs. 10 lakh for stopping a moneylender from being arrested in vidarbha while he was chief minister of maharashtra. unless you see usury at criminal rates of interest as a vital plank of rural progress, dr. singh's logic was hard to follow. and the maharashtra government even paid up the fine for mr. deshmukh., the adarsh scam, in the adarsh scam, mr. deshmukh is one of three former chief ministers under a cloud. as >the hindu (june 18, 2011) reported, he stoutly denied having cleared the file on that sleazy deal on his last day as chief minister. he also rebutted charges of fudging the records. the courts long ago slammed the cbi for its tardy investigation into the adarsh rip-off. that vital files keep vanishing has not helped the baffled sleuths in their task., last week, the bombayhigh court said vilasrao deshmukh “clearly misused his official position as a chief minister of a state.” this was in connection with a deal struck by the maharashtra film, stage and cultural development corporation while he was chief minister. the deal, a “joint venture,” gave subhash ghai's film training institute, whistling woods, possession of 20 acres of prime real estate at rock bottom rates. “we clearly disapprove the conduct of respondent no. 7 vilasrao deshmukh …”, said the court. it rapped him for the role he played “in the entire proceedings leading to the signing of the jv agreement.” the whole deal, said the outraged court, was “illegal, arbitrary and without authority of law.” but mr. deshmukh's track record defies the laws of gravity, leave alone those of the nation., in december 2010, justice a.k. ganguly of the supreme court admonished mr. deshmukh in scathing terms in the moneylender case. in his judgment, justice ganguly said he found the message it conveyed “extremely shocking and it shocks the conscience of this court about the manner in which the constitutional functionaries behaved in the state of maharashtra.” (justice ganguly is no stranger to shocking things and was more recently on the bench which gave that historic verdict in the 2g scam). the judgment went on to say “it is clear that the chief minister was aware of various complaints being filed against the said family the moneylenders. even then he passed an order for a special treatment in favour of the said family which is unknown to law.”, moneylender case, the judgment noted that mr. deshmukh's action “amounts to bestowing special favour to some chosen few at the cost of the vast number of poor people who, as farmers, have taken loans and who have come to the authorities of law and order to register their complaints against torture and atrocities by the moneylenders.” and so mr. deshmukh set another record. it is hard to recall when a cabinet minister and former chief minister was punished and fined this way by the highest court of the land., prime minister singh's response?

2013-05-10,paid news pandemic undermines democracy,"in a major twist to the ashok chavan vs. madhav kinhalkar legal battle (more notorious as the “paid news” scandal), leading civil society organisations and eminent individuals have approached the supreme court to implead themselves into the case., their intervention application, moved by advocate prashant bhushan, minces no words on their reasons for doing so. they are disturbed by “the stranglehold of money power on our electoral politics.” and by a recent move of the union law ministry which could destroy the election commission of india’s power to disqualify candidates filing incorrect or false accounts., the applicants for intervention hope to defeat “the nefarious design” of the union government which seeks to “undo all the good work done by the election commission of india.” and which further seeks, to “unsettle the law already settled” by the supreme court of india. they wish to ensure that the eci “retains the plenitude of its power and authority to safeguard the purity and integrity of the electoral process.” which includes holding candidates to account on poll expenses., this action follows the union law ministry filing a counter-affidavit on behalf of the government in the ashok chavan case. that affidavit, first reported by >the hindu on march 20, asserts that “the power of the election commission to disqualify a person arises only in the event of failure to lodge an account of expenses and not for any other reason, including the correctness or otherwise of such accounts.” simply put: the government claims the eci has no right to disqualify a candidate even if his accounts are found to be improper or fraudulent. if accepted, this would virtually gut the powers of that constitutional body.
