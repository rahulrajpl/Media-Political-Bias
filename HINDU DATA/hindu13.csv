2011-04-04,a struggle between 'reform cadre' and the 'old line' in the congress,"electoral defeats in 2007 and their impact on impending uttar pradesh polls made some congressmen seek 'a more saleable political face at the head of the government.' photo: kamal narang , after the congress suffered electoral losses in punjab and uttarakhand in february 2007, some party members advocated that party president sonia gandhi “jettison” prime minister manmohan singh ahead of the uttar pradesh assembly election in april-may 2007 and “put a more saleable political face at the head of the government,” according to a united states embassy cable (>100159: confidential) sent on march 13, 2007., “following a string of recent local-level electoral defeats in mumbai, uttarakhand, and punjab, sonia gandhi and her personal advisors are very concerned that the impending uttar pradesh (up) elections will turn out horribly for congress. as a result, some are advocating that she jettison prime minister singh — whose message of rapprochement with pakistan has been criticized by the bjp — and put a more saleable political face at the head of the government,” the cable sent under the name of embassy charge d'affaires geoffrey pyatt reported to washington., the embassy appeared worried about the “reform cadre” in the government being sidelined by the “old line” congress with socialist sympathies. “what seems clear in the aftermath of recent polls is that the reform cadre of manmohan singh, deputy chairman of the planning commission montek singh ahluwalia, and finance minister p. chidambaram are politically diminished, sonia gandhi's inner coterie is deeply worried, and the old line congress and their communist fellow-travelers are empowered. politics in india are a mess right now for congress, and while the goi government of india is publicly optimistic about the nuclear deal, it is clearly caught in a domestic political eddy,” the cable added., it also took note of the political compulsions of the congress that might have a bearing on u.s. interests. “others are urging that the congress hunker down and play it safe on the budget, inflation, economic reform, and foreign policy — including the nuclear deal — to minimize the negative impact on up voters, many of whom are muslim and take a dim view of the united states.”, the cable, accessed by the hindu through wikileaks, was sent ahead of a visit to india by secretary of energy samuel bodman to further the u.s.-india relationship in the energy sector., mr. pyatt, in the “scene-setter” for the visit, expressed the hope that mr. bodman could win over the indian nuclear scientific establishment with the prospect of “future-oriented programs” like the global nuclear energy partnership. “your scheduled meetings in mumbai with department of atomic energy secretary dr. anil kakodkar and in new delhi with special envoy shyam saran offer an opportunity to highlight the many benefits of u.s.-india civil nuclear cooperation, which could be lost if india does not conclude the 123 agreement quickly,” he wrote., briefing mr. bodman on what to expect during his meetings in india, the charge said: “the prime minister will likely tell you that his number one priority is extending the benefits of india's rapid growth to the 700 million indians — mostly in the rural sector — who continue to live at a near subsistence level. rising food and fuel prices have particularly hurt the poor, creating a political backlash against the upa government in recent state elections. prime minister singh and your other interlocutors will be very interested in your ideas on how the united states can help with india's energy needs in the short and long term, particularly with respect to the rural sector.”, looking ahead to mr. bodman's meeting with union minister of petroleum and natural gas murli deora, mr. pyatt wrote that mr. deora had “close ties to sonia gandhi's inner circle and a political base in mumbai, and he is central to india's international quest for growing petroleum and natural gas imports, and cooperation with the united states in domestic industry development and regulatory policy.” the minister had told american diplomats that india did not expect a final agreement to be reached on the oil pipeline with iran due to iranian unreliability and iran changing the terms of the june 2005 agreement to sell india lng from its south pars field for 25 years. “the mpng increasingly sees lng from qatar and australia as a more viable option than several proposed pipeline projects,” the cable noted., while giving the energy secretary a backgrounder to the u.s.-india civil nuclear negotiations, mr. pyatt said indian foreign secretary shivshankar menon had handed under secretary nicholas burns a “completely inadequate counter-draft to the 123 agreement — authored by the skeptics in india's nuclear establishment who remain concerned about u.s. efforts to ‘entrap' india and constrain its strategic program.”, mr. burns, the cable added, had asked mr. menon to “provide a more workable basis on which the u.s. and india can continue talks, and invited an indian team with negotiating authority to the u.s. for the next round of discussions.” (this was sent before the two countries released the full text of the 123 agreement, which allows for cooperation on peaceful uses of nuclear energy, in august 2007.), analysing the compulsions of the congress-led government in this context, it said:, “the politics around india's energy policy reflects a struggle between needed economic reform and political impediments to change. prime minister singh and deputy chairman ahluwalia are well aware of what economic reforms are needed to enhance india's long term

2011-09-22,the omertà on sonia gandhi's illness,"new delhi,12/05/2010: upa chairperson and congress president sonia gandhi at the swearing in ceremony of chief justice of india at rashtrapati bhavan, in new delhi on may 12, 2010. | photo credit: v.v. krishnan , in february 2010, following a convention that the president of the united states will make public the results of his annual medical examination, the white house released details of president barack obama's first health check in office. this included his medication history, the doctor's recommendation that he follow a diet to reduce his cholesterol levels, and kick his smoking habit., in the united kingdom, there is no convention of revealing the medical histories of leaders. in september 2009, amid rumours about prime minister gordon brown's health, a bbc journalist asked him during an interview that was going out live on air if he was taking “prescribed painkillers and pills” to help him cope with his work pressures. the question angered the labour party, which described it as an “intrusion” into the prime minister's health. but within weeks, downing street took what the guardian described as “the unusual step” of revealing the results of mr. brown's eye check-up that showed two tears in his retina. it said it was disclosing the information in the interest of “transparency” and to put an end to the rumours., in india too, when prime minister manmohan singh had to undergo a heart surgery in early 2009, the government went public with details of his medical condition. on sonia gandhi's health, however, the silence continues even after her return from treatment for an illness that has not been made public — but is widely believed to be cancer of some kind., all that the nation has been told is that almost immediately on her return, the congress president chaired a party meeting to choose candidates for the uttar pradesh elections to be held early next year. no photographs of ms gandhi have appeared since her return; the media have used file photographs or old footage to announce that she is back in india after her treatment, and in reporting that she has resumed work as party president. the most recent photographs of her are from her visit to bangladesh in early august., dr. singh is perhaps among the handful of people who are informed about the state of ms gandhi's health. but officials in the prime minister's office are not in the know. the home minister, the home ministry and the intelligence bureau also appear to have been kept out of the loop., her absence from india, from around august 4, the day the party first announced she had gone abroad, to september 8, when her arrival back was announced, coincided with a stormy period in national politics. anna hazare's hunger strike for the jan lokpal bill plunged the united progressive alliance (upa) government into a crisis. the congress needed all the leadership it could muster but stood exposed for having none. while it is debatable if ms gandhi could have steered the ship any better, rahul gandhi's late intervention by way of his speech in parliament certainly failed to work the miracle that the congress had hoped for., the gandhi family and the congress party have dealt with ms gandhi's illness as a “personal matter” that requires no public explanation. true, politicians are entitled to privacy in matters of health. but this right to privacy cannot hold if it impacts on their work. ms gandhi has led the congress for more than a decade; her party's election victories are credited to her leadership. the argument that ms gandhi does not hold high office, is not the head of the government, and therefore her illness is not a matter of public importance, hardly holds. since 2004, she has been seen universally as the main power centre in the upa. clearly, several matters of national importance ride on her health, including her ability to lead the party into the next election, and the issue of succession in the congress leadership, should this become necessary. these are not private matters., the hush-hush is reminiscent of the secrecy that surrounded the condition of leonid brezhnev as the soviet leader's health deteriorated through 1982. while the official line was that he was suffering from only a minor ailment, the communist party of the soviet union had already worked out a line of succession., on the other hand, we have the openness of former new york mayor rudy guiliani's battle with prostate cancer, whose let's-talk-about-it attitude helped the cancer awareness campaign in the u.s. turn him into an iconic survivor of the disease. more recently, venezuelan president hugo chávez spoke publicly about his battle with cancer., that the congress should be secretive about ms gandhi's health is not surprising. what is surprising, though, is the omertà being observed by the news media, usually described by international writers as feisty and raucous. on this particular issue, reverential is the more fitting description. barring editorials in the business standard and mailtoday, no other media organisation has thought it fit to question the secrecy surrounding the health of the government's de facto number one., a similar deference was on display a few years ago in reporting atal bihari vajpayee's uneven health while he was the prime minister. for at least some months before he underwent a knee-replacement surgery in 2001, it was clear he was in a bad way, but no news organisation touched the subject. eventually, the government disclosed that he was to undergo the procedure, and it was covered by the media in breathless detail., both before and after the surgery, there was an unwritten understanding that photographers and cameramen would not depict mr. vajpayee's difficulties while walking or standing. post-surgery, a british journalist who broke ranks to question if the prime minister was fit enough for his job (“asleep at the wheel?” time, june 10, 2002) was vindictively hounded by the government., almost a decade later, much has changed about the indian media, which now likes to compare itself with the best in the world. but it lets itself down again and again. the media silence on ms gandhi is all the more glaring compared with the amount of news time that was recently devoted to omar abdullah's marital troubles. the jammu & kashmir chief minister's personal life has zero public importance. yet a television channel went so far as to station an ob van outside his delhi home, and even questioned the maid. the keyhole coverage ended only when an agonised mr. abdullah put out a brief statement about his separation and a request that he and his family be left alone.",0.06420245144383073,omertà sonia gandhi ' illness,"new delhi,12/05/2010 : upa chairperson congress president sonia gandhi swearing ceremony chief justice india rashtrapati bhavan , new delhi may 12 , 2010. &#124;

2012-03-21,the writing on the wall,"addressing the media on march 7, a day after the results of the five assembly elections were announced, congress president sonia gandhi attributed the outcome against the party to “wrong candidates, organisational weaknesses, party members not taking serious responsibilities, and too many leaders in the party.”, further, she observed that the electoral reverses would have no adverse impact on the united progressive alliance government. asked about the possibility of early general elections, the congress president declared: “we're in 2012, and manmohan singh will continue to be the prime minister till 2014.”, talking of “weak” candidates, the congress president and the office-bearers authorised by her alone should be held responsible for their selection. under the election symbols (reservation and allotment) order, 1968, the party president and such office-bearers authorised by the president alone can issue form b to notify a returning officer about a party's candidate and the allotment of its election symbol to him or her. without the forms duly signed on behalf of the party, nobody can enter a contest., in the uttar pradesh assembly elections, the congress had an alliance with the rashtriya janata dal. there were 355 congress candidates in the field, of whom only 25 won., in the 2002 uttar pradesh assembly elections, there were 402 congress candidates to win 25 seats. in 334 places they lost their security deposit. in the 2007 elections, the congress contested in 393 seats, to succeed in 22; it lost the deposit in 323 places., all these three rounds of election took place in this largest state of india, in terms of population, under the same party president — sonia gandhi., nehru's record, from its birth in 1895 till independence in 1947, the indian national congress elected a president each year to address its annual session. during that period, jawaharlal nehru was the only leader to become congress president for four terms. in free india, in addition to being the prime minister, he held the post of congress president for three terms. thus, on the whole, jawaharlal nehru held the record of being president of the congress for seven terms, till 1964., after the assassination of rajiv gandhi in may 1991, sonia gandhi withdrew from all political activity. after much persuasion by several congress leaders, she enrolled herself as a primary member in the last week of december 1997. thereafter, within 62 days, she was made president of the congress on march 1, 1998. she continues to hold the post. indeed, in the long history of the indian national congress, she has been the longest-serving president — for over 14 years., during his lifetime, even nehru — during the course of the freedom struggle and in independent india — had to contend with veterans such as sardar vallabhbhai patel, abul kalam azad and c. rajagopalachari. compared to those times, sonia gandhi has a highly subservient and docile party machine to reckon with. she has become the unassailable leader., apart from holding the post of party president, in 1999 she was appointed leader of the opposition. and since 2004, she has been the chairperson of the united progressive alliance in all its forms (first during 2004-2009 and then from 2009 till now)., no other president of the congress party, or any party in india for that matter, has ever wielded such a level of control on all aspects of the party organisation, and on all crucial decisions of its governments at the centre or in the states. in a recent historical narration of the latest phase of the indian national congress that has been published, there is extreme adulation. it terms sonia gandhi a ‘mahatma.', sonia gandhi and her son rahul gandhi are now members of parliament representing the constituencies of rae bareli and amethi that have been notable in the political history of the nehru-gandhi family., feroze gandhi won elections in rae bareli in 1952 and 1957, but died in 1960. indira gandhi, who became prime minister in 1966, contested successfully in rae bareli first in 1967 and then in 1970. though she was defeated in rae bareli by raj narain in the tornado poll-sweep of the janata party in 1977, she contested there again in 1980 to win, and to go on to become prime minister., sanjay gandhi won the 1980 election in amethi; unfortunately, he died in an air crash a few months later in june 1980. his elder bother, rajiv gandhi, was drafted into politics and entered parliament by means of a by-election in amethi. in october 1984, indira gandhi was assassinated. then rajiv gandhi again won from amethi to become prime minister in 1984. in the wake of the bofors howitzer deal scandal, the congress was defeated in the 1989 elections, but rajiv gandhi himself won in amethi to become leader of the opposition. after his death, in 1999, sonia gandhi contested successfully from amethi. and over the next two elections, she contested successfully in rae bareli, in 2004 and in 2009., washout for congress, however, in the latest round of assembly elections in uttar pradesh, all the congress candidates fielded in the five assembly segments in the rae bareli parliamentary constituency were defeated. though sonia gandhi had topped in terms of the number of votes polled in all these assembly segments in the 2004 and 2009 general elections, it was a washout for the congress candidates there. within rahul gandhi's amethi parliamentary constituency, only two candidates reached the winning post., the election symbol of the congress is the hand, with five fingers spread out. in uttar pradesh, each parliamentary constituency has five segments. in rae bareli, all the five fingers of the hand were cut off, and in amethi three were lost., the congress president has since asserted that the election outcomes in uttar pradesh and the other states would have no impact on the upa government, but she has failed to assess the reverse impact of the misrule of upa-ii on the long-suffering people of disadvantaged sections throughout india, with scam after scam involving the loss of mind-boggling sums of money, widespread corruption percolating from the ruling authority in delhi, astounding audit revelations, forthright judicial expositions, fall in rupee value, spiralling prices of food articles and commodities of common consumption, and rising unemployment levels. the incompetence of the union government is manifest. a tongue-tied prime minister appears to be helpless in taking action against any wrongdoing minister, under the peculiar cult of “coalition dharma.”, when the oppressed millions got the ballot under the scarce “democratic dharma,” they have hit hard at the rajas, the rahuls, and their minions parading as mps and ministers. it was the fury of the masses that crushed the ambitious targets fixed by congress leaders., the overall polling percentages in the five states have risen in 2012 compared to those recorded in 2007. moreover, in every state concerned, the number of women voters coming to vote surpassed that of the men voters., impact on alliance, the aftermath of the decisive downfall of the congress in the assembly election round has severely affected the coherence of the alliance; some of the partners seem to be even trying to distance themselves from the government., manmohan singh as prime minister is helpless and hopeless when it comes to tackling critical situations. take, for instance, the removal of dinesh trivedi as railway minister. let us not be concerned here with the merits or demerits of the budget proposals. the cabinet had accepted his proposals and the prime minister also appreciated his work. the prime minister showed hesitation in the matter until the president of the alliance party in question vehemently insisted that the minister should go.",0.10681451612903224,writing wall,"addressing media march 7 , day results five assembly elections announced , congress president sonia gandhi attributed outcome party “wrong candidates , organisational weaknesses , party members taking serious responsibilities , many leaders party. ” , , observed electoral reverses would adverse impact united progressive alliance government. asked possibility early general elections , congress president declared : “we ' 2012 , manmohan singh continue prime minister till 2014. ” , talking “weak ” candidates , congress president office-bearers authorised alone held responsible selection. election symbols ( reservation allotment ) order , 1968 , party president office-bearers authorised president alone issue form b notify returning officer party ' candidate allotment election symbol her. without forms duly signed behalf party , nobody enter contest. , uttar pradesh assembly elections , congress alliance rashtriya janata dal. 355 congress candidates field , 25 won. , 2002 uttar pradesh assembly elections , 402 congress candidates win 25 seats. 334 places lost security deposit. 2007 elections , congress contested 393 seats , succeed 22 ;

2012-03-21,the writing on the wall,"addressing the media on march 7, a day after the results of the five assembly elections were announced, congress president sonia gandhi attributed the outcome against the party to “wrong candidates, organisational weaknesses, party members not taking serious responsibilities, and too many leaders in the party.”, further, she observed that the electoral reverses would have no adverse impact on the united progressive alliance government. asked about the possibility of early general elections, the congress president declared: “we're in 2012, and manmohan singh will continue to be the prime minister till 2014.”, talking of “weak” candidates, the congress president and the office-bearers authorised by her alone should be held responsible for their selection. under the election symbols (reservation and allotment) order, 1968, the party president and such office-bearers authorised by the president alone can issue form b to notify a returning officer about a party's candidate and the allotment of its election symbol to him or her. without the forms duly signed on behalf of the party, nobody can enter a contest., in the uttar pradesh assembly elections, the congress had an alliance with the rashtriya janata dal. there were 355 congress candidates in the field, of whom only 25 won., in the 2002 uttar pradesh assembly elections, there were 402 congress candidates to win 25 seats. in 334 places they lost their security deposit. in the 2007 elections, the congress contested in 393 seats, to succeed in 22; it lost the deposit in 323 places., all these three rounds of election took place in this largest state of india, in terms of population, under the same party president — sonia gandhi., nehru's record, from its birth in 1895 till independence in 1947, the indian national congress elected a president each year to address its annual session. during that period, jawaharlal nehru was the only leader to become congress president for four terms. in free india, in addition to being the prime minister, he held the post of congress president for three terms. thus, on the whole, jawaharlal nehru held the record of being president of the congress for seven terms, till 1964., after the assassination of rajiv gandhi in may 1991, sonia gandhi withdrew from all political activity. after much persuasion by several congress leaders, she enrolled herself as a primary member in the last week of december 1997. thereafter, within 62 days, she was made president of the congress on march 1, 1998. she continues to hold the post. indeed, in the long history of the indian national congress, she has been the longest-serving president — for over 14 years., during his lifetime, even nehru — during the course of the freedom struggle and in independent india — had to contend with veterans such as sardar vallabhbhai patel, abul kalam azad and c. rajagopalachari. compared to those times, sonia gandhi has a highly subservient and docile party machine to reckon with. she has become the unassailable leader., apart from holding the post of party president, in 1999 she was appointed leader of the opposition. and since 2004, she has been the chairperson of the united progressive alliance in all its forms (first during 2004-2009 and then from 2009 till now)., no other president of the congress party, or any party in india for that matter, has ever wielded such a level of control on all aspects of the party organisation, and on all crucial decisions of its governments at the centre or in the states. in a recent historical narration of the latest phase of the indian national congress that has been published, there is extreme adulation. it terms sonia gandhi a ‘mahatma.', sonia gandhi and her son rahul gandhi are now members of parliament representing the constituencies of rae bareli and amethi that have been notable in the political history of the nehru-gandhi family., feroze gandhi won elections in rae bareli in 1952 and 1957, but died in 1960. indira gandhi, who became prime minister in 1966, contested successfully in rae bareli first in 1967 and then in 1970. though she was defeated in rae bareli by raj narain in the tornado poll-sweep of the janata party in 1977, she contested there again in 1980 to win, and to go on to become prime minister., sanjay gandhi won the 1980 election in amethi; unfortunately, he died in an air crash a few months later in june 1980. his elder bother, rajiv gandhi, was drafted into politics and entered parliament by means of a by-election in amethi. in october 1984, indira gandhi was assassinated. then rajiv gandhi again won from amethi to become prime minister in 1984. in the wake of the bofors howitzer deal scandal, the congress was defeated in the 1989 elections, but rajiv gandhi himself won in amethi to become leader of the opposition. after his death, in 1999, sonia gandhi contested successfully from amethi. and over the next two elections, she contested successfully in rae bareli, in 2004 and in 2009., washout for congress, however, in the latest round of assembly elections in uttar pradesh, all the congress candidates fielded in the five assembly segments in the rae bareli parliamentary constituency were defeated. though sonia gandhi had topped in terms of the number of votes polled in all these assembly segments in the 2004 and 2009 general elections, it was a washout for the congress candidates there. within rahul gandhi's amethi parliamentary constituency, only two candidates reached the winning post., the election symbol of the congress is the hand, with five fingers spread out. in uttar pradesh, each parliamentary constituency has five segments. in rae bareli, all the five fingers of the hand were cut off, and in amethi three were lost., the congress president has since asserted that the election outcomes in uttar pradesh and the other states would have no impact on the upa government, but she has failed to assess the reverse impact of the misrule of upa-ii on the long-suffering people of disadvantaged sections throughout india, with scam after scam involving the loss of mind-boggling sums of money, widespread corruption percolating from the ruling authority in delhi, astounding audit revelations, forthright judicial expositions, fall in rupee value, spiralling prices of food articles and commodities of common consumption, and rising unemployment levels. the incompetence of the union government is manifest. a tongue-tied prime minister appears to be helpless in taking action against any wrongdoing minister, under the peculiar cult of “coalition dharma.”, when the oppressed millions got the ballot under the scarce “democratic dharma,” they have hit hard at the rajas, the rahuls, and their minions parading as mps and ministers. it was the fury of the masses that crushed the ambitious targets fixed by congress leaders., the overall polling percentages in the five states have risen in 2012 compared to those recorded in 2007. moreover, in every state concerned, the number of women voters coming to vote surpassed that of the men voters., impact on alliance, the aftermath of the decisive downfall of the congress in the assembly election round has severely affected the coherence of the alliance; some of the partners seem to be even trying to distance themselves from the government., manmohan singh as prime minister is helpless and hopeless when it comes to tackling critical situations. take, for instance, the removal of dinesh trivedi as railway minister. let us not be concerned here with the merits or demerits of the budget proposals. the cabinet had accepted his proposals and the prime minister also appreciated his work. the prime minister showed hesitation in the matter until the president of the alliance party in question vehemently insisted that the minister should go., it was after much deliberation that the constituent assembly decided to adopt the british model of cabinet government. on the essence of the collective responsibility of the cabinet, dr. b.r. ambedkar had asserted: “one principle is that no person shall be nominated to the cabinet except on the advice of the prime minister. secondly, no person shall be retained as a member of the cabinet, if the prime minister says he shall be dismissed … as i said, collective responsibility can be achieved only through the instrumentality of the prime minister.” (constituent assembly debates, 30 december 1948), the times have of course changed. the prime minister today has no authority as envisaged by dr. ambedkar. whether it is raja or trivedi, he has to be instructed by the party president concerned. the cabinet system of governance as devised and accepted by the constitution is not being followed. we have a cabinet without a competent prime minister, and a prime minister without an effective government.",0.11650735294117645,writing wall,"addressing media march 7 , day results five assembly elections announced , congress president sonia gandhi attributed outcome party “wrong candidates , organisational weaknesses , party members taking serious responsibilities , many leaders party. ” , , observed electoral reverses would adverse impact united progressive alliance government. asked possibility early general elections , congress president declared : “we ' 2012 , manmohan singh continue prime minister till 2014. ” , talking “weak ” candidates , congress president office-bearers authorised alone held responsible selection. election symbols ( reservation allotment ) order , 1968 , party president office-bearers authorised president alone issue form b notify returning officer party ' candidate allotment election symbol her. without forms duly signed behalf party , nobody enter contest. , uttar pradesh assembly elections , congress alliance rashtriya janata dal. 355 congress candidates field , 25 won. , 2002 uttar pradesh assembly elections , 402 congress candidates win 25 seats. 334 places lost security deposit. 2007 elections , congress contested 393 seats , succeed 22 ;

2012-08-18,no glass ceiling but hard ground realities,"hamid ansari before being sworn-in as the vice president for the second consecutive term at rashtrapati bhavan in new delhi. file photo , hamid ansari is an honourable man, erudite as well as personable, deserving in every way to share with sarvepalli radhakrishnan the honour of holding the office of vice-president twice. his re-election, though, does raise an intriguing question: why it is that a political class which is otherwise quite indifferent to the chronic underrepresentation of muslims in parliament, the civil service, the police and many other walks of life allows muslims to reach their natural level of accomplishment when it comes to august – but essentially ceremonial -- offices like that of the president and vice-president?, look at the statistics. of the 12 vice-presidents india has had, three of them – or 25 per cent -- have been muslim. should one decide to work out the figures on the basis of elections fought and won, and therefore count radhakrishnan and ansari twice, the score is an impressive 28.5 per cent. the figures for the post of president are almost comparable – three, or 23.07 per cent, of the 13 presidents have been muslim, the percentage dipping marginally to 21.4 per cent if one were to count rajendra prasad twice for the two terms he served. for muslims who constitute 13.4 per cent of the population, this amounts to statistical over-representation in these two offices., it also challenges what indian sociologists consider a truism: that it is only in sports, films and entertainment that muslims have a presence in consonance with their population. in all these three fields, sociologists argue, patronage and social network are factors contributory in nature, required initially to ensure talent doesn’t languish in anonymity. thereafter, merit becomes the main determinant of success. even a generous godfather can’t win a shah rukh khan his legion of followers, as partial selectors can’t possibly bag wickets for a zahir khan., sociologists must now expand the category of jobs for which there is no glass ceiling for capable muslims to include the posts of president and vice-president. but there is a difference. to earn nomination to these two posts, a candidate must have had an extraordinary career in politics or outside it; yet it is also true that his or her religious and caste identities are as vital. unlike, say, in sports or films, the muslim-ness of a person, at least to the extent obvious from his or her name, is a factor ruling parties always take into account for sponsoring his or her candidature. it’s altogether another issue that muslim presidents and vice-presidents like zakir hussain, a.p.j. abdul kalam and hamid ansari have acquitted themselves admirably in office, commanding respect beyond their community., the phenomenon of muslim presidents and vice-presidents creates two contradictory images of the community. there is the muslim gracing rashtrapati bhavan, holding lavish state banquets, and driving around in an impressive cavalcade; there is the muslim presiding over the house of elders and representing india at important diplomatic events. and then there is the muslim, poor and aspiring, sporting a skull cap and a beard, fearful of being stopped at police barricades, or picked up and implicated in terrorism cases., which of the two images is more accurate can be gleaned from the report of justice (retd) rajindar sachar, who chaired the high-level committee on the social, economic and education status of the muslim community. the sachar committee report notes, “they (muslims) carry a double burden of being labelled as ‘antinational’ and as being ‘appeased’. while muslims need to prove on a daily basis that they are not ‘antinational’ and ‘terrorists’, it is not recognized that the alleged ‘appeasement’ has not resulted in the desired level of socio-economic development of the community.”, electing a muslim as vice-president is an easier task than ameliorating the deplorable condition of his community. if asked, he would rather prefer the fate of the schedules castes. constituting 16.2 per cent of india’s population, they have had just one president, but enjoy tremendous state support for their socio-economic uplift. it is nobody’s case that the structural backwardness of muslims is as severe as that of dalits. yet the relative absence of muslims in central government jobs makes them perceive their over-representation in ineffectual but prestigious high state offices as an example of tokenism. analysing the data of 88 lakh government employees, the sachar committee found only 5 per cent were muslim. the committee also reported that in 2006 that muslims were only 3 per cent of the indian administrative service, 1.8 per cent of the indian foreign service, and 4 per cent of the indian police service., in its defence, the upa could cite the decision to carve out 4.5 per cent for minorities within the 27 per cent obc reservation for central government jobs and admission to educational institutes. yet, as critics point out, this reservation extends to obc castes of all minorities, not only those of muslims. what hope of success can they have against better-educated sikhs and christians? even the implementation of this policy has been stayed by the andhra pradesh high court. this was because the government neither provided evidence of having carried out surveys to justify treating minorities as a separate category within the obc quota nor did it refer the issue, as it should have, to the national commission for backward classes. political expediency best explains the government’s poor preparatory work to introduce reservation for muslims. announced a few weeks before the uttar pradesh assembly election, the congress hoped to use the carrot of reservation to garner the votes of muslims and simultaneously ensure there wasn’t much time for its rivals to consolidate the hindus against the measure., this fear of a hindu backlash can be discerned in the government’s multi-sectoral development programme (msdp), which identified 90 districts in which minorities constitute 20-25 per cent of the population for special intervention. yet there have been vociferous complaints against choosing district as the unit for intervention, for, it is alleged, funds often get spent in those areas where muslims are not present in substantial numbers. advocating the initiation of highly visible, specific muslim-targeted projects, civil society activist harsh mander, in his foreword to the centre for equity studies’ survey report of the msdp, notes candidly, “i recognise that it is not easy for the country’s leadership to muster the political courage for this. i speculate that political managers of the ruling combine possibly caution against providing grist to the opposition’s charges of ‘minority appeasement’.”",0.10203295530760316,glass ceiling hard ground realities,"hamid ansari sworn-in vice president second consecutive term rashtrapati bhavan new delhi. file photo , hamid ansari honourable

2013-01-02,"needed, urgent electoral reforms","when the election commission of india turned 60 on january 25, 2010, the hindu opened its lead editorial of january 29 with the words, “after overseeing 15 general elections to the lok sabha, the eci, in its diamond jubilee year, can with justifiable pride claim to have nursed and strengthened the electoral processes of a nascent democracy. the successes have not been consistent or uniform, but over the last six decades the eci managed to make the world’s largest democratic processes freeer and fairer.”, largest management exercise, as the chief election commissioner of india, i had the satisfaction of stewarding the general election of 2009, arguably the largest management exercise in the world, with integrity and transparency on display in each of the country’s 543 parliamentary constituencies. it is however important to remember that this globally admired institution was built brick by brick from the days of sukumar sen, who faced innumerable odds when he conducted india’s first general election in 1951-52, when literacy was a dismal 16 per cent and where an enormous structure had to be created in even then, the world’s largest democracy., over the years the commission kept pace with changing needs, aspirations and technology. in 1988 prime minister rajiv gandhi’s government amended the constitution to reduce the voting age from 21 to 18, thereby enfranchising a whole new generation of voters. in 1982, electronic voting machines made a quiet trial entry in the by-election to the parur assembly constituency of kerala. later, they were tried in a few states until 2004, when chief election commissioner t.s. krishnamurthy took the plunge and conducted the entire general election using almost a million machines., for paucity of space, the reforms and good practices that developed over the years can at best be briefly recounted. these included the creation of a fully computerised database of electors, followed in 2009 by a comprehensive photo electoral roll; election cards reached 514 million voters in time for the general election and de-duplication technologies helped further eliminate bogus and duplicate entries. a booth level officer was created to become the custodian of the electoral roll at each polling station, leading to constant door-to-door verification of electors. myriad forms of voter assistance were built in on and prior to the election day. general and expenditure observers were supplemented by micro-observers to keep the poll day processes transparent. video cameras began to record the polling and counting procedures. through the strategy of “vulnerability mapping,” first tried on any scale in the uttar pradesh election of 2007, localities that for reasons of deliberate exclusion, accident or design did not turn up to vote, were identified and enabled to vote. the commission developed a system of online communication (comet) that made it possible to monitor every polling booth on the day of election. in the recent himachal pradesh election, there was real-time monitoring of polling at all 7,553 booths using gps and a web-enabled facility through the google search engine. above all, a vital instrument of the election commission of india’s impartiality, the model code of conduct, designed to neutralise the ‘lal batti’ culture and level the playing field between candidates of the ruling party and those in opposition, earned even the grudging respect of political players in the fray! throughout these years of innovation and development, the supreme court of india has stood like a rock behind the commission, ensuring it a clear field once elections are announced and until they cease. this respect and support have earned the admiration of many polities in our neighbourhood and beyond., on the flip side, however, the hindu editorial also pointed out the challenges of criminalisation of politics and the misuse of money power. “the dominant role of money in elections, which is taking more and more outrageous forms, is deeply worrying. instances of politicians paying for news coverage and bribing voters were widespread in the 2009-2010 elections”., i do agree that these are major problems which have already assumed such proportions that i fear that the electoral process in the future may well stand compromised at the altar of ‘winnability.’ the process is also reflective of a growing disconnect between the governed and several of those who are elected by means of financial clout and covert muscle power, to dangerously fill the vacuum that stands created. the subject of criminality in politics as well as the dangers of huge overspending, are part of the reforms package that successive election commissions have addressed to successive governments. the response over two decades has been tepid, but now there are glimmers of hope that change may come., let me take electoral finance first. although statutory limits were increased in 2011 to broadly rs. 40 lakhs for a parliamentary seat and rs. 16 lakhs for an assembly election, levels of actual spending exceed these limits. the eci does its best by posting as many as 2000 senior officers as observers during a parliamentary election, but in spite of such a large machinery, the candidates and parties use stealth to their advantage. clearly, raising the monetary ceiling from time to time will not be the answer, while doing away with the ceiling altogether will lead to the creation of oligarchies with little trace of true representation. according to one estimate, in the recent elections in himachal pradesh, the declared income of the 10 richest candidates is cumulatively over rs. 394 crores! in the recent gujarat election, the 20 richest candidates all won, among whom the richest declared assets of a whopping rs. 268 crores!, as early as 1972, the joint parliamentary committee on amendments to election laws suggested that the state assume the burden of legitimate election expenses of candidates and political parties. in 1978, the tarkunde committee echoed the need for some electoral expenses being taken up by the government. the dinesh goswami committee (1990) suggested state funding in kind. the law commission report of 1999 pointed to partial state funding. in 2004, the president in his address to the joint session of parliament announced the new government’s intent for state funding, itself an item on the national common minimum programme of the upa. however, when the eci convened an all-party meeting in february 2006 to discuss the centre’s proposal on state funding and invited the six recognised national and 44 recognised state-level political parties, on the proposal of funding not in cash but in terms of facilities, the majority view was that this would only add to the advantages of bigger parties., it is true that in many well set democracies the proportion of state funding has been increasing vis-à-vis private financing, but if the 2006 dialogue was anything to go by, it would necessitate the strong will of the national parties to deliberate different models where state funding can be supplemented by proportional air time in the electronic media, which the eci can administer on the basis of an agreed formula. the eci must also be empowered to de-register non-serious political parties and the representation of people act 1950 amended to more harshly punish electoral violations.",0.09208777333777332,"needed , urgent electoral reforms","election commission india turned 60 january 25 , 2010 , hindu opened lead editorial january 29 words , “after overseeing 15 general elections lok sabha , eci , diamond jubilee year , justifiable pride claim nursed strengthened electoral processes nascent democracy. successes consistent uniform , last six decades eci managed make world ’ largest democratic processes freeer fairer. ” , largest management exercise , chief election commissioner india , satisfaction stewarding general election 2009 , arguably largest management exercise world , integrity transparency display country ’ 543 parliamentary constituencies. however important remember globally admired institution built brick brick days sukumar sen , faced innumerable odds conducted india ’ first general election 1951-52 , literacy dismal 16 per cent enormous structure created even , world ’ largest democracy. , years commission kept pace changing needs , aspirations technology. 1988 prime minister rajiv gandhi ’ government amended constitution reduce voting age 21 18 , thereby enfranchising whole new generation voters. 1982 , electronic voting machines made quiet trial entry by-election parur assembly constituency kerala. later , tried states 2004 , chief election commissioner t.s. krishnamurthy took plunge conducted entire general election using almost million machines. , paucity space , reforms good practices developed years best briefly recounted. included creation fully computerised database electors , followed 2009 comprehensive photo electoral roll ; election cards reached 514 million voters time general election de-duplication technologies helped eliminate bogus duplicate entries. booth level officer created become custodian electoral roll polling station , leading constant door-to-door verification electors. myriad forms voter assistance built prior election day. general expenditure observers supplemented micro-observers keep poll day processes transparent. video cameras began record polling counting procedures. strategy “vulnerability mapping , ” first tried scale uttar pradesh election 2007 , localities reasons deliberate exclusion , accident design turn vote , identified enabled vote. commission developed system online communication ( comet ) made possible monitor every polling booth day election. recent himachal pradesh election , real-time monitoring polling 7,553 booths using gps web-enabled facility google search engine. , vital instrument election commission india ’ impartiality , model code conduct , designed neutralise ‘lal batti ’ culture level playing field candidates ruling party opposition , earned even grudging respect political players fray !

2014-04-26,"she, the people","illustration: deepak harichandan , there is a mocking bird at the heart of indian parliamentary democracy but its teasing call is lost amid the high-voltage electoral rhetoric with its distinct masculinist overtones. asks the mockingbird: how gender equal is a polity where articulations of women’s concerns are framed in the most misogynist and cynical ways? how democratic is a system that witnesses a rise in the number of voting women, even as the presence of female candidates declines?, as election 2014 unspools, phase by phase, many of the scenarios it throws up recall elections past. here again we have the same unequal distribution of seats to women; the same disgustingly sexualised treatment accorded by election crowds and party functionaries to women candidates; the same disproportionately large number of women making it to the candidates’ list because of their supposed “glamour quotient”; the same blasé fielding of male candidates with serious charges of crime, including that of rape., the one important difference in 2014 is that for the first time in india’s electoral history — possibly because of the electric charge of popular outrage following the delhi gang rape — women have become a major subject of electionspeak. but why is it that a development we have long waited for, and which should have enthused us, tastes like ashes?, there is opportunism in the manner the thread of violence has been teased out and spun. the amazing variations expressed on the theme of rape provide a clue to why india remains one of the most women-hostile societies. perhaps we should thank mulayam singh yadav for revealing the truth behind the impunity with which rapists have been allowed a free rein and which would explain the appallingly low level of convictions. his ‘boys will be boys’ theory has become the common sense of the times, internalised by every section of the criminal justice system from policemen to administrators to judges., those serious about addressing violence against women perceive it against a backdrop of structured inequalities. while they recognise that “women” as a category is not homogenous, they also see the commonalities that bind them. these include missed educational opportunities, seriously declining employment possibilities, oppressive family structures, economic growth patterns that reinforce hierarchies, urban development that create gender unequal public spaces, declining sex ratios and lack of voice and political representation. none of this has got much traction in current election debates. instead we have patriarchal promises of ‘protection’, pledges to dilute inconvenient laws and exhortations to avenge those who attack “our women”. the same mulayam singh yadav, who professes extraordinary sympathy for gang rapists, fought against the women’s reservation bill doggedly over the years. narendra modi has no qualms in projecting himself as a great champion of women despite presiding over a state with a steadily declining sex ratio and a steadily increasing number of rapes; and whose party does not support the decriminalisation of section 377 which is essentially about sexual autonomy., but why is modi, once content to peddle lines like ‘hum paanch, hamare pachees’, now urging us to “empower women”. rahul gandhi, on his part, is keen that women get 12 cylinders of cooking gas a year. why should cooking gas be seen as a bonanza for women rather than the entire family? stances of this kind testify to the emerging power of the women’s vote. once perceived as an undifferentiated mass of sari-draped/burqa-clad appendixes of the significant other, women are now being increasingly courted as a distinct constituency and offered a wide range of enticements, including ‘free’ mehendi sessions!, several reasons could be cited for this unprecedented acknowledgement of presence but i will confine myself to two. the first is that while the male voting segment has remained more or less stable, and despite a significant under-enumeration of female voters, there is evidence to suggest that the number of women among today’s voters is rising., this is a trend confirmed by eyewitness accounts. media persons who covered the 2012 uttar pradesh assembly elections recounted the carnivalesque mood among women voters who dressed up for their tryst with the pinging machine as if they were going to a local mela., what this indicates, possibly, is the demystification of the election process once seen as a male preserve that could only be negotiated under male guidance. one need only recall the emotional appeal of a sarojini naidu nearly 100 years ago to understand how many layers of patriarchal control had to be unpeeled to arrive at the present moment. speaking at the special session of the congress in 1918, naidu had pleaded: “we ask for the vote not that we might interfere with you in your official functions, your civic duties, your public place and power, but rather that we might lay the foundation of national character in the souls of the children we hold upon our laps, and instill into them the ideals of national life.”, rising literacy, the burgeoning of media presence and 20 years of panchayati raj — resulting in 2.5 lakh institutions of local government and 1.30 million women grassroots representatives — may have “let in daylight upon magic”. today, women are participating in electoral democracy, not just by the mere act of voting but by attending election meetings, participating in rallies, distributing party materials and door-to-door canvassing. praveen rai, using data compiled by the centre of the study of developing societies, estimated that such involvement increased from 13 per cent to 20 per cent from the 1999 to the 2004 general elections., political parties, while they encouraged such involvement and benefited from it, drew the line when it came to fielding women. sarojini naidu’s timorous assurances never to challenge male authority have proved prophetic with party establishments ruling that a woman’s place is in the polling booth, not on the podium. the number of female candidates in proportion to the total number actually came down over the last three elections., but the picture is not entirely monochromatic. when women members of the aam aadmi party came out firmly against party leaders’ nebulous stand on khap panchayats; when women’s groups recently petitioned that parties field at least 33 per cent women candidates in winnable seats; when a ‘womenifesto’ with a six-point agenda for change emerges; when songs burst out urging women to raise questions during these elections, they spell a new-sprung recognition of the unjustifiable asymmetries of power and the will to resist a masculinist, money-fuelled and criminalised electoral order., the writer is editor-in-chief, women’s feature service., rising vote, a study of the “sex ratio” of indian voters by commentators mudit kapoor and shamika ravi published in the economic and political weekly found that the number of female voters for every 1,000 male voters rose from 715 in 1960s to 883 in 2000s, even while the male voting participation remained the same., citing data from 20 state assembly elections from 2010 onwards, the election commission found that women voters outnumbered men in 16. the gap between male and female voters has been narrowing since 1962 but the most dramatic evidence of such tapering occurred between 2004 and 2009., in the 2012 uttar pradesh assembly elections, 60.29 per cent of women voters came to the polling booths, while the corresponding figure for men was 58.82 per cent., similar scenes are being enacted in general election 2014 too., number games",0.06559785864031145,", people","illustration : deepak harichandan , mocking bird heart indian parliamentary democracy teasing call lost amid high-voltage electoral rhetoric distinct masculinist overtones. asks mockingbird : gender equal polity articulations women ’ concerns framed misogynist cynical ways ?

2015-06-06,the membership mantra,"bharatiya janata party (bjp) president amit shah announced on april 30 that the bjp is now the largest political party in the world with more than 10 crore members, surpassing the communist party of china’s 8.3 crore members. the bjp’s membership drive via telephone calls began on november 1, 2014, when the party’s supporters had to give a simple ‘missed call’ to a designated number to get enrolled in the party. the membership drive has now entered the second phase, in which all personal details of the recruited members are being collected., but the increase in membership has not yielded the party any electoral benefits. the bjp had more members in new delhi during the 2015 assembly elections than it did in the 2014 lok sabha elections. yet, it polled a smaller share of votes in 2015 than it did in 2014. the hindu business line reported that the bjp polled approximately 29 lakh votes in the 2015 assembly elections even though it purportedly had more than 40 lakh party members living in the city. in west bengal, in the recently concluded local body polls, the party polled less votes than its membership total of 42 lakhs. this suggests that the bjp’s members are not voting for the party., however, this is not restricted to the bjp alone. during our fieldwork in the 2012 uttar pradesh assembly elections, congressmen in the state complained that the votes polled were fewer than the number of primary members of the party in their constituency., organisational benefits?, if its members are not all voting for the party, why is the bjp paying so much importance to its membership drive? will these members bring organisational benefits to the party? the congress’s history can help provide an answer. during the 1950s and 1960s, membership in the congress increased when the party held its organisational elections. in 1960, the congress had 47 lakh primary members. in 1961, a year before the elections were to be held, the number doubled to 95 lakh. but it dropped to 27 lakh in 1963. prime minister narendra modi and mr. shah are, therefore, probably aware that the membership drives led by ‘missed calls’ do not add anything substantial to the organisational core of a party. the individuals who are giving ‘missed calls’ to the party are not automatically becoming active members, that is, members who work for the party for at least seven days and induct at least another 100 people into the party., so why is there a thrust on this membership drive? in our view, it may be part of an effort to create a centralised voter database with the mobile numbers of potential voters, through which the party will be able to reach voters directly with campaign material and text messages. it will also be less dependent on ground-level functionaries to mobilise votes for it. this is a grand experiment., but will the strategy work? to win elections, a party needs initiative at the ground level. take the delhi elections, for instance. political commentators have attributed the bjp’s poor performance in delhi to several reasons: voters have voted differently in national and state elections; the aam aadmi party’s chief ministerial candidate was more popular than the bjp’s; too much power was concentrated in the hands of one party; the bjp was propagating rightwing politics., we believe that the bjp’s vote share in delhi declined between may 2014 and february 2015 because the party failed to match its own mobilisational efforts during the lok sabha elections. data show that the party managed to retain its core vote share in delhi, even while the congress and smaller parties collapsed. a large number of voters supporting these parties during the 2013 assembly elections voted for the bjp during the lok sabha elections, but shifted towards the aap in 2015., many people we spoke with said that the bjp made efforts to mobilise voters by contacting citizens individually during the lok sabha elections, but no such effort was made in the campaign to the assembly elections. the aap, on the other hand, not only managed to match the bjp’s voter mobilisation efforts, but also surpassed it in some senses. the lokniti-centre for the study of developing societies data clearly suggest that the aap reached out to more voters than the bjp through canvassers, recorded telephonic messages, and text messages., as the graphic shows, the aap had a clear advantage over the bjp among the respondents who did any kind of mobilisational work such as participating in rallies, canvassing, donating money, or distributing pamphlets. while the aap managed to attract 45 per cent of such individuals to participate in elections rallies and processions, the bjp managed to attract only 33 per cent. similarly, while the aap had 48 per cent of such respondents engaging in door-to-door canvassing and 51 per cent distributing pamphlets, the bjp had the support of only 36 per cent and 30 per cent of such respondents, respectively. there were also twice as many individuals donating money for the aap as for the bjp.",0.12309807678660135,membership mantra,"bharatiya janata party ( bjp ) president amit shah announced april 30 bjp largest political party world 10 crore members , surpassing communist party china ’ 8.3 crore members. bjp ’ membership drive via telephone calls began november 1 , 2014 , party ’ supporters give simple ‘missed call ’ designated number get enrolled party. membership drive entered second phase , personal details recruited members collected. , increase membership yielded party electoral benefits. bjp members new delhi 2015 assembly elections 2014 lok sabha elections. yet , polled smaller share votes 2015 2014. hindu business line reported bjp polled approximately 29 lakh votes 2015 assembly elections even though purportedly 40 lakh party members living city. west bengal , recently concluded local body polls , party polled less votes membership total 42 lakhs. suggests bjp ’ members voting party. , however , restricted bjp alone. fieldwork 2012 uttar pradesh assembly elections , congressmen state complained votes polled fewer number primary members party constituency. , organisational benefits?

2015-10-01,"scripting clean polls, via aadhaar","having photos printed on the electoral rolls was a step towards making identification easier at the polling station. photo: v. raju , the election commission (ec) starts its annual revision of electoral rolls throughout the country in september ever year. the exercise becomes more significant for the states going to the polls the following year. elections are due in assam, kerala, tamil nadu, west bengal and puducherry in the first half of the next year., except in the states where polls are scheduled, the political parties and the voters are generally apathetic to the roll-revision work. in the poll-bound states, however, the political parties can be hyperactive, as happened in tamil nadu prior to the> 2006 assembly elections when party leaders were given targets for registration of voters, leading to allegations of malpractices and, as a result, filing of cases by the ec against some party functionaries., multiple enrolments by voters the ec’s efforts to have a clean electoral roll with full enrolment often falters due to a variety of reasons. relentless urbanisation and inter-and intra-city movements pose a challenge to having an updated and accurate electoral roll in urban areas. a study carried out in bengaluru prior to the 2008 >assembly elections in karnataka revealed that the year-on-year change varied from 6 to 8 per cent., in the rural areas, though the booth level officer (blo) system works better in tracking changes, the problems there are of a different kind. the election law is clear that a person can be registered as a voter in a place where he is ordinarily resident. however, thanks to various ‘collateral’ issues, persons who are not ‘ordinarily resident’ at a place continue to be on the electoral rolls. for instance, come election time, there is an exodus from chennai to the southern districts of tamil nadu as people from these areas who have settled in chennai flock to their respective native places to exercise their franchise., the duplication due to their enrolment in electoral rolls of both their respective native places and chennai is an invitation to bogus voting., in the run up to the uttar pradesh assembly elections in 2007, an intensive checking of rolls revealed many cases of people who had migrated to mumbai decades earlier but continued to be on the electoral rolls in their native place as, for them, having their names on the electoral rolls was an additional proof for claims on family property., prior to the gujarat elections of 2008, a member of parliament from mumbai had brought to the ec’s notice names of voters found on the electoral rolls both in mumbai and in a constituency in north gujarat. the chief election officer (ceo) of gujarat issued a warning that being listed in more than one place was an offence and his vigilant efforts to prevent any large-scale duplication proved to be a sufficient disincentive, except for a dozen or so voters., seasonal migration of labour from bihar, eastern up, jharkhand and madhya pradesh is a well-known phenomenon; some may even stay back much longer as is the case in jalandhar where, after getting jobs in the textile industry there, migrant agricultural labourers from bihar have continued their stay. according to a recent report, in tamil nadu alone, there is a >labour force comprising nearly 10 lakh people hailing from northern states. they constitute a potential bogus voter pool in their native places., duplication of names on electoral rolls is prevalent in places like an urban area and its neighbouring villages as well as in villages on either side of state borders. recently, a voter proudly told me that he has two >voter identity cards, one with the address of his rural home near chennai and the other with his city address., prior to the 2006 assembly elections in kerala, the then ceo found an abnormal increase in the voter population in two constituencies, one in the palakkad district and the other in the kasargod district. he traced it to a duplication in registration — the voters had been on the rolls of both the districts and the adjoining areas of coimbatore and mangalore. in the manjeshwar constituency of the kasargod district, the names of nearly five thousand such bogus voters were struck down, which, incidentally, had been the margin of victory in the previous elections., for the 2008 assembly elections in rajasthan and madhya pradesh, the election commission, fearing a similar occurrence in the border villages, scheduled the polls on the same date in all adjoining constituencies ., aware of the large-scale migration of labour for surat’s diamond industry from districts in saurashtra, the ceo of gujarat did a name comparison of voters in the varachha constituency of surat district — largely inhabited by migrants from saurashtra — and a couple of constituencies in the districts of their origin, and found out 50,000 potential cases of duplication. an advertisement for voluntary declaration led to only 2,000 disclosures. appreciating the impossibility of physically verifying the rest of the 48,000 entries, the ec opted to schedule polls in surat and in the selected districts of saurashtra on the same day, though they were not contiguous areas., it was the redoubtable t.n. seshan, former cec, who conceived the idea of an electors photo identity card (epic) issued by the election commission to contain bogus voting. his diktat of ‘no id card, no polls’ was opposed by politicians in several poll-bound states, citing a lack of funds. ultimately peace was brokered under the supreme court’s directions and, ever since, photo id cards have come to be the mainstay in establishing a voter’s identity. however, from time to time, innovative excuses are proffered to prevent their use. in the run-up to the 2007 punjab assembly elections, the then chief minister sought exemption from production of photo ids by voters, alleging that the opposition party was purchasing cards to prevent voting by a section of the population., reference point to avoid duplicationhaving photos printed on the electoral rolls was a step towards making identification easier at the polling station. but even photo id card is no answer to the problem of duplicate registrations. the photo id card was designed to have a unique number but there was no way to prevent a second card from being issued to the same person if he/she did not voluntarily disclose information as there was no reliable reference point against which checking could be done. a matching of photos was the only option but it is enormously time-consuming and needs physical verification before coming to a final conclusion. it is here that aadhaar provides a clean and easy solution., since aadhaar has a reliable backing by way of fingerprint and iris scan for identification, the scope for duplication is next to nil. further, and more importantly, to verify for duplication, election officials will require >nothing more than an aadhaar number — not even the fingerprint or iris scan — and, where necessary, will have to query the unique identification authority of india (uidai) website for just a ‘yes’ or ‘no’ answer for the authenticity of the number., the question of a breach of privacy is a complete non-starter in this arrangement. as the role of aadhaar goes up, the system of an elector’s photo identity card (epic) can be phased out, saving cost. with aadhaar, it is possible to enrol a person in a polling station/constituency and simultaneously remove his name from a different polling station/constituency, thus avoiding duplication and also making voter enrolment simpler.",0.11124492432631963,"scripting clean polls , via aadhaar","photos

2016-06-07,nitish kumar’s prohibition card,"in his electoral meetings and rallies during the 2015 campaign for the bihar assembly elections, nitish kumar promised that if his grand alliance came to power, there would be a >complete ban on the sale of liquor in bihar. he got support not only from dalit and backward caste women but also from the upper caste women in the rural areas. indeed, upon winning another term, he delivered on the promise. in his previous two terms as chief minister, he had consolidated the women’s vote with free education and distribution of bicycles and uniforms. curbing the sale of alcohol was a logical next step., the uttar pradesh assembly elections are the next big electoral battlefield, and mr. kumar’s janata dal (united) is investing much political capital in a grand alliance kind of bid in the state. as a show of intent, he has already addressed a big meeting in the pindra vidhan sabha constituency that falls in varanasi, prime minister narendra modi’s lok sabha constituency. he declared that his alliance would go to the people with two main campaign planks: anti-communalism and prohibition. he asked the bharatiya janata party (bjp) to put forth its opinion on the anti-liquor movement. it was decided in pindra that the jd(u) would make every effort to ban liquor in every village of u.p. there is a very high possibility that this issue may gain traction in the u.p. assembly elections., a long historyprohibition is not a new political agenda in india. in his fight against colonialism, mahatma gandhi had addressed it both social and politically. he had a four-pronged strategy. his first aim was to spread social reform consciousness and make india a liquor-free nation by creating awareness. the second was to gain support for the nationalist cause among the bottommost rungs of society through issues that impacted their daily life. third, he tried to create a counter-culture against western ways. lastly, he challenged the british economic system and western food culture by his appeal against liquor consumption., the social reform movements which emerged during the british raj, like the adi hindu movement of swami achhutanand, popular among the arya samaj and the dalits, shivnarayani sect, ravidas sect, kabir sect and other similar popular sects considered liquor as the biggest evil in society and tried to liberate people from its clutches through their preachings. in this way, during the colonial period many questions of social reform and nationalist politics were somewhat intermingled with each other. keeping in mind this background, mahatma gandhi raised the ban of liquor as an important cultural and political question. after india attained independence, the government did not take any initiative in the anti-liquor campaign — instead, considering it to be good source of revenue for the state, it helped in its distribution., women whose menfolk spent their earnings on alcohol and inflicted domestic violence were the worst sufferers, and they raised the issue politically. support for prohibition also came from the poorer, marginalised sections of society, as expenditure on alcohol drained the meagre budgets of families. in a related change, due to the rise in migration of people from the villages towards cities, more money flowed to the villages, and one of the ways this manifested itself was in the popularity of the so-called indian-made foreign liquor, and not just country liquor, in rural areas., bsp’s challengeinterestingly, when kanshi ram started the bahujan movement in u.p. in the 1980s, his first programme to mobilise the dalits was on the issue of prohibition. the anti-liquor movement extended to places like bareilly, rampur, azamgarh, meerut, moradabad, etc. where dalit women participated actively. at present too women are a dominant support base of the bahujan movement in the state, which can also been seen in the number of women present

(right) with his uncle shivpal in lucknow. | photo credit: rajeev bhatt , in 2012, as he prepared for the uttar pradesh assembly elections, akhilesh yadav’s objective was to transform the battle-scarred samajwadi party (sp) into a tech-savvy, cosmopolitan, post-anna hazare organisation. he hoped this would help the sp regain the government and the lustre it had lost in 2007 thanks to the infusion of lathi-brandishing and trigger-happy partymen in its ranks., traversing the state on his kranti rath yatra, akhilesh yadav would say that he wanted the sp to shed its image of being an anti-english, anti-technology gathering of parochial muscle-men. but he was equally clear that he wanted the party to retain its socialist ideals., he said ram manohar lohia, the socialist icon, was his inspiration as well as the link to the party’s socialist origins. “lohiaji studied in english, but he understood the villages, the poor, and he spoke their language,” he said. “i am from the same tradition.”, it was a point that sp supremo mulayam singh yadav would make to senior congress leader s. jaipal reddy about his son when he first introduced the two of them to each other. “touch his feet,” he told the mysuru and sydney-educated akhilesh yadav. he added: “jaipalji, yeh hai to mera beta par aapke jaise angrezi bolta hai” (jaipalji, he is my son but he speaks english like you.) , the sp won a clear majority in the 2012 assembly election and akhilesh yadav, the face of the campaign, became the chief minister of u.p. but four and a half years later, he is nowhere near accomplishing what he had set out to do. worse, last week, much to the delight of the sp’s political rivals in this election season, the power struggle within the party, and the competing priorities of members of the yadav clan and their friends, spilled onto the streets. , the young chief minister, by sacking two tainted ministers, sought to send out an unequivocal message that he would not tolerate corruption. he also tried hard to show that he was the boss, if belatedly, when he responded to his removal as sp state president by divesting his uncle shivpal yadav of most of his ministerial portfolios., in large sections of the party, and in the bureaucracy, there was a sense that finally a transition to a more wholesome brand of politics and governance was around the corner. the days of “four and a half chief ministers” are over, an official told me, adding, “uttar pradesh has one chief minister and his name is akhilesh yadav. it’s good the rift has come to the surface. akhilesh ki image-making ho gayee hai (akhilesh’s image has been made). shivpal is finished.” this view was reflected on the streets of lucknow. , among the yadavs, the sp’s core supporters, the junior yadav is the new favourite. in gokulpur village in the neighbouring district of barabanki, rakesh kumar yadav said, “the mulayam singh yadav era is over. shivpal has no support. we’ll vote sp because of akhilesh. he should not have been removed as state president."", but by saturday evening, that euphoria subsided when mulayam singh yadav hit back. he ensured that shivpal yadav got back all his portfolios barring one — the public works department — and confirmed his appointment as state chief. besides this, gayatri prasad prajapati was inducted in the cabinet despite facing charges of corruption. mr. prajapati, said to be a mulayam singh yadav’s favourite, is an associate of his second son prateek yadav, born to his second wife sadhna gupta. , later in the day, the ageing party supremo read the riot act to sp workers who were noisily demonstrating on the streets in solidarity with akhilesh yadav. he told them that rajya sabha mp amar singh, who is seen by many in the party as a catalyst for the current crisis, had stood by him in bad times, and that his decision to make shivpal yadav state president was final. , as a sop, akhilesh yadav was made chairman of the state parliamentary board, a position that will give him a say in the selection of candidates for the 2017 assembly polls. , but as akhilesh yadav tries to reinvent the sp and give it a broader and more contemporary appeal, he is being thwarted at every turn by his own family. he has not only had to contend with a cohort of uncles, and his father and his favourites, for control over both the government and the party but also his step-brother prateek yadav’s business interests and the return to the party of amar singh, a man whom he had helped to oust from the sp a few years back. shivpal yadav, officials in lucknow say, would regularly get akhilesh yadav’s decisions changed without the latter’s knowledge, by getting the new decisions cleared by mulayam singh yadav. , shivpal yadav and his nephew don’t just represent two generations but two world views. the uncle, adept at backroom networking and keeping the yadav community happy, is also the quintessential organisation man, with a hold over party mlas and old-timers. he also has the ability to make friends with people who he thinks matter, including the controversial amar singh and sp national general secretary mohammad azam khan. and it is said that unlike akhilesh yadav, he never argues with mulayam singh yadav.

(right) with his uncle shivpal in lucknow. | photo credit: rajeev bhatt , in 2012, as he prepared for the uttar pradesh assembly elections, akhilesh yadav’s objective was to transform the

2016-10-18,back to the bsp’s roots,"leading voice: “ms. mayawati has not consistently championed the dalit cause in recent years. but when she speaks up, it changes the discourse.” file photo of the bsp leader before a press conference in lucknow. , “it is a matter of grave concern that the bjp government, driven by the agenda of the rss, is trying to abolish reservations and other rights given by our constitution because of the efforts of dr. ambedkar to those people who have remained neglected for centuries, especially dalits, adivasis, and backwards... and not only that, these sections are being oppressed and exploited in bjp-ruled states. the case of the dalit student, rohith vemula, the una incident in gujarat, and the dayashankar singh incident in uttar pradesh are some important examples., “the condition of these oppressed groups is not going to change with the bjp government's announcement of some memorials and museums honouring their messiah babasaheb dr. bhimrao ambedkar, or, like the congress party, occasionally sharing meals with dalits and backwards... faced with injustice, persecution and caste discrimination, these sections do not want words and pity from the bjp and narendra modi. they want those responsible to be held accountable by law. they want, along with self-respect, equality, reservations and other rights guaranteed to them by the constitution…”, this was ms. mayawati, speaking at an october 9 rally in lucknow on kanshi ram’s death anniversary, in a resounding return to the dalit-bahujan roots of the bahujan samaj party. the bsp was created as a champion of the “bahujan samaj”, which it defined as the majority constituted by a coalition of downtrodden minorities: dalits, adivasis, backwards and religious minorities, or, in its own words, everyone but the hindu upper castes. it had moved away from its founding ideology in the last two decades by courting the hindu upper castes, replacing its advocacy of the “bahujan samaj” with an umbrella appeal to “sarvsamaj”, all sections of society. now, on the eve of the 2017 uttar pradesh elections, all mentions of “sarvsamaj” have been scrubbed from mayawati’s speeches and her party’s website. instead, the bsp has returned to its old strategy of appealing to its core base of dalit voters, along with other bahujan groups — particularly muslims in this election — on a constituency-by-constituency basis., the bsp’s return to its roots, just like its earlier deviation from them, is driven by pragmatic considerations. it is trying to regain the ground it lost to the bjp in the 2014 parliamentary elections. highlighting the series of violent incidents targeting dalits that occurred under bjp rule in a span of just 12 months — the burning alive of two dalit children in faridabad in october 2015, the suicide of rohith vemula in the university of hyderabad in january, the public beating of dalit youths by cow-protecting vigilantes in una in gujarat in july, and the use of abusive language towards mayawati by the bjp’s then u.p. state vice-president dayashankar singh a few days later, which she successfully framed as an insult to all dalits and all women — hits the bjp where it is most vulnerable. these incidents had also created such anger among those in her own base that ms. mayawati could hardly afford to ignore them. instead, she has worked them into a broader appeal which, as the old bsp did, emphasises the common interests and the common predicament of diverse minorities. the persecution of both dalits and muslims in the name of cow protection has lent particular force to this appeal., ms. mayawati’s strong advocacy of the bahujan samaj may not last beyond the verdict. if the elections produce a hung assembly, the imperatives of coalition politics may well dilute the bsp’s position again. but even if pragmatic or short-lived, this advocacy is important., to see why, consider a basic fact: almost all directly elected dalit legislators in india, in both the lok sabha and the state assemblies, belong to parties that are dominated by some other group., in the current lok sabha, only three of the 85 dalit mps belong to a dalit-led party — the lok janshakti party, led by ram vilas paswan. (the bsp won no seats in the 2014 parliamentary election.) the overwhelming majority of dalit mps belong to parties with a leadership that is either forward caste or, less often, from the backward castes: 40 dalit mps belong to the bjp, another 7 dalit mps belong to the congress, one dalit mp belongs to the cpi(m), and the remaining 34 to regional parties., in the state assemblies, taken together, there are currently 612 dalit mlas. only 3 per cent belong to a dalit-led party, and most of these mlas belong to the bsp. the largest single group of dalit mlas also belongs to the bjp (25 per cent), with another 14 per cent belonging to the congress, and 4 per cent to the two communist parties. the remainder belong to regional parties with non-dalit leaders., the fact that dalit legislators in india almost always belong to parties in which some other group controls the reins means that their voices rarely shape the debate on how dalits are treated in india. the voices that have the greatest weight in defining the positions of their parties in this debate are the voices of the groups that lead them, most often hindu upper castes., in principle, everybody has a right to speak on questions of how subordinate groups in india are treated. discrimination against dalits or muslims or backward castes or women is not the problem of dalits or muslims or backward castes or women alone: it is everybody’s problem. in a democratic polity, this means that everybody should also have a voice in the debate over such discrimination. but the groups to which they belong inevitably shape the sensitivities of the speakers. and the fact that the debate among political parties over the conditions of dalits has been shaped to a very large extent by non-dalit voices has created some important silences., rohith vemula’s death is a case in point. his suicide produced a vigorous debate between political parties, on the streets and in parliament. but, although the bjp is the party which has the largest number of dalit mps and also the largest number of dalit mlas, its response contained little empathy and no effort to acknowledge or address the broader issues of caste discrimination in the context of which vemula killed himself. instead, the emphasis was on avoiding responsibility. opposition parties, meanwhile, used vemula’s death to attack the bjp for its role in his death. for both sides, the discourse around vemula’s suicide became more about the bjp and culpability than about dalits and discrimination.",0.04529936974789915,back bsp ’ roots,"leading voice :

2017-02-24,up elections: beneath the surface calm,"by any reckoning, the narendra modi-led bharatiya janata party (bjp) had been dealt the best set of cards for uttar pradesh 2017. its 2014 lok sabha performance — 71 of 80 seats won on a vote share of 42% — provided it with both an air of invincibility and a margin to withstand a large negative vote swing., yet today u.p. presents a confounding picture as the seven-phase election to the state assembly enters midpoint. there are keenly fought triangular — and in places quadrangular — contests where only some months ago an emphatic lead for the bjp was treated as a given., the uncertainty must explain why the bjp campaign, which started on a lofty note with a promise to stay above caste and religion, has begun to tread the familiar ground of hindu consolidation. the references to kabristan (graveyard) and shamshaan (cremation ground) in a speech by mr. modi, and amit shah’s coinage of the acronym ‘kasab’ (name of the pakistani terrorist caught and hanged by india for 26/11) for his opponents, leave no scope for misunderstanding which way the bjp campaign is being led., mr. modi and his party chief should rest easy. if they leave the pulpit for a few days and travel in western u.p., they might be stunned to discover that the model citizen of their imagination, who is one part proud hindu and one part aspirational, already exists. this citizen has rote learnt and can recite at will all that has been communicated to him ever since the bjp became a major player in u.p. politics. and this ideological grooming is independent of who he might vote for in an election., which is why a bjp victory or defeat is really only for the record. the language and thought processes of u.p.’s people have already been transformed and conditioned by the corrosive discourse that has split the state on hindu-muslim lines. analysts have welcomed the absence of communal violence and failed attempts at polarising voters along hindu-muslim blocks in this election as a sign of a state and its people returning to normality after four years of being held hostage to communal provocations. the muzaffarnagar riots of 2013 may have been physically located in western u.p. but the poison from it had travelled wide, thanks to hotheads such as yogi adityanath headquartered in eastern u.p. the lynching of mohammad akhlaq in dadri and the pernicious love jihad campaign were nothing if not muzaffarnagar by another name., on a recent tour of western u.p., i was astonished by how often a well-conducted, amicable conversation suddenly got diverted into hate talk and muslim-bashing. this happened at almost every stop i made and was a pattern that cut across castes., in one word, muzaffarnagar, and the communal divide it has come to represent, hasn’t gone anywhere. in the 2014 election, voters primarily connected with mr. modi on the aspirational promise. however, they knew exactly what cues to pick up when he spoke in the same breath of pakistan, the soldier dying on the border, and the “pink revolution” sweeping the country. the last mentioned was a euphemism for the rise in meat exports, with the further veiled suggestion that the meat in question was beef., also readmuslim vote split between sp and bsp in eastern u.p. , muslim vote split between sp and bsp in eastern u.p., the reason why voters in the 2014 election readily absorbed the subtext to mr. modi’s messages was because they had already been primed for it by muzaffarnagar. mr. modi’s instantly attractive ‘politics of transformation’ came wrapped in the tricolour: u.p. and its people could shine only if the nation could shine and the jawan was given his respect. that this could be understood as excluding muslims was perhaps intended., travelling in western u.p., i found a deceptive calm in the parts where the 2013 riots had raged. prima facie, it seemed that the wounds of the past had healed. there were examples of jats voting for muslim candidates in places such as purqazi, a jat-dominated reserved constituency in muzaffarnagar district, and thana bhawan in shamli district. jat villagers in kaji kheda in purqazi said they would vote for choti begum of the ajit singh-led rashtriya lok dal (rld) in preference to the bjp’s pramod utwal. choti begum is a dalit married into a muslim household and hence the begum suffix. jats have a history of hostility with dalits while jats and muslims, once the backbone of jat icon chaudhary charan singh’s peasant parties, have been turned into two inimical blocks by the muzaffarnagar violence. on both counts, jats would seem to have transcended their prejudices., also readmounting a late comeback , mounting a late comeback , in thana bhawan, the bjp’s candidate, suresh kumar, was pitted, among others, against the rld’s javed rao. mr. rana was an accused in the muzaffarnagar violence, which automatically placed him on the side of jats, who saw themselves as primary victims in the hindu-muslim conflict. but jats, or at least a section of them, seemed to have voted for javed rao., had i walked away after merely ascertaining the voting preferences of jats in both places, i should have truly been happy and convinced that jats and muslims had finally reconciled to living in harmony. but longer conversations revealed that hate and suspicion lingered deep in jat hearts. ms. begum and mr. rao were the preferred choices only because jats felt betrayed by the bjp which had reneged on promises made to them. there was anger over denial of a job quota to the community, but bafflingly, the litany of complaints included the modi government’s failure to abrogate article 370 of the constitution which gives jammu and kashmir its special status. to add to this, jats were seized by guilt that in the 2014 election they had preferred the bjp to mr. singh, a fellow jat and heir to the mantle of charan singh., also readjats in west u.p. drifting away from bjp , jats in west u.p. drifting away from bjp, but, as they argued, their vote was to the rld, not its muslim candidates. “we swallowed a bitter pill,” they said. further, in 2014, the bjp was their “only defence against the aggression of muslims.” a few days after my interaction with jats in kaji kheda, i received a call from deependra malik, who was among those i had spoken to. he said jats had set out to vote the rld’s choti begum, but on voting day a good number had switched to the bjp after hearing reports of a massive muslim consolidation in favour of the samajwadi party-congress alliance: “an sp-congress victory means return of muslim supremacy which we will not allow.”, in khanpur village, which falls in the siwalkhas assembly constituency of meerut district, the elder jats unanimously placed their faith in ajit singh, reciting the by now familiar complaints against the bjp. however, the mood changed dramatically when a boisterous group of young jats muscled into our conversation. they noisily proclaimed that mr. modi was and will remain their hero. a 16-year-old school boy, anirudh chhikara, was presented to me as the region’s ‘mini sangeet som’. the chief claim to fame of mr. som, the sitting mla and current candidate from sardhana, also in meerut district, is that he is an accused in the 2013 riots. on january 17, 2017, mr. som, nicknamed sangharshveer (brave warrior) for frontally fighting muslims, had a case booked against him for showing video clips of the 2013 riots. however, for ‘mini sangeet som’ and other young jats, this was only proof that he remained committed to protecting ‘us from them’., also readyogi adityanath unleashes hindutva blitz , yogi adityanath unleashes hindutva blitz , as in the case of jats, there were reports of

2017-03-13,2017 assembly elections: first among unequals,"five assembly elections in five different states cannot possibly have one running national theme. but when one of them is in uttar pradesh, with the largest electorate in the country by far, the debate inevitably moves to the possible pointers for the 2019 lok sabha election. even if the bharatiya janata party’s victory in uttar pradesh and uttarakhand was expected, the more than three-fourths majority was a surprise to supporters and detractors alike. nearly three years after the lok sabha election, nothing much seems to have changed on the electoral ground. the biggest takeaway is that prime minister narendra modi remains the pan-indian face of the bjp, and the combination of the promise of economic development and the propagation of a muscular nationalism is hard to beat. those who thought that mr. modi’s popularity had peaked in 2014 were probably right, but instead of a sharp decline from then on, his acceptance among voters seems to have reached a comfortable plateau., also reada birthday gift for amarinder , a birthday gift for amarinder, in both u.p. and uttarakhand, the bjp’s vote share dipped only marginally, from 43.6% (together with smaller allies) in 2014 to 41.4% in the former, and from 55.9% to 46.5% in uttarakhand. in the absence of a united opposition, as in bihar in 2015, the elections in both states were a stroll in the park. any gains the samajwadi party and the congress made through an alliance were lost because of the infighting in the sp, and owing to a slightly improved performance by the bahujan samaj party, which at 22.2% polled 2.4% more of the total votes in 2017 over 2014 despite finishing a poor third. the sp leader and outgoing chief minister of uttar pradesh, akhilesh yadav, did try to shed some of the anti-incumbency baggage by distancing himself from the old guard in the party, but in the process his party came across as a divided house. voters quite rightly refused to buy into the narrative that the failures on the law and order front and the shortcomings in governance were entirely on account of an earlier generation of leaders. if he was attempting to appeal to the youth, projecting himself and congress vice-president rahul gandhi as the face of the campaign, he did not quite succeed in it. a grand alliance of the kind that saw the bjp lose in bihar would have had to include the bsp, unthinkable though it is given the caste dynamics at play. but bsp supremo mayawati did herself no favours by continuing to be averse to a pre-poll tie-up, while displaying an unseemly readiness to align after the election without any ideological compunctions. the bsp, which has allied with the sp and the bjp at different points, needs to reconsider this strategy if it wants to expand beyond its core dalit constituency. the party may not have held much appeal for minorities, despite fielding muslims in about one-fourth of the total seats. in the present political climate, in the absence of a bihar-type grand alliance it would appear that the bjp’s rivals can do little but hope that prime minister modi squanders his goodwill over the next two years in a series of political missteps and administrative failures in delivering on promises., also readwe need to come out of hindu-muslim politics: amit shah , we need to come out of hindu-muslim politics: amit shah, if uttarakhand, as in the case of uttar pradesh, stuck to the 2014 script, punjab voted very differently. the bjp was only a junior partner in the alliance led by the shiromani akali dal. also, the alliance suffered greatly from the anti-incumbency factor, having completed two terms in office. actually, punjab was more important for the congress than it was for the bjp. a loss to the emerging aam aadmi party would have been disastrous, with long-term implications across the country. but the fact that the party held off the challenge from arvind kejriwal’s party is in no small measure thanks to captain amarinder singh, its chief ministerial candidate. in recent years, the congress and the bjp have reversed their roles. the congress, which once boasted of strong national leaders and little-known regional satraps, is now in a situation where it needs strong leaders at the state level to make up for rahul gandhi’s relative lack of charismatic appeal at the national level. the congress cannot afford to be in the hands of a small and insular coterie. if it is to replicate elsewhere its success in punjab, the party needs to learn from amarinder singh, who was much more alive to the threat from the aap than the national leadership was. as the bjp concentrates power in the hands of one person, a risky as well as undesirable approach to adopt for any party, the congress needs to do exactly the opposite. no matter what it believes of itself, the congress is no longer the natural party of government. it is the bjp that has emerged to occupy this space in the altered political environment. whether the party likes it or not, the congress will have to build a credible opposition to the bjp, little by little, state by state, instead of trying to pit mr. gandhi against the vastly more experienced mr. modi in what is clearly an unequal battle., also readup defeat hurts, need hard decisions: congress ",0.14324772449772455,2017 assembly elections

2017-08-09,the mood of the moment: the collective targeting of opposition,"“we said the person who leads the country should be secular, should have a vision of inclusive growth. this country was constituted under a constitution whose basic values, egalitarianism, pluralism and inclusiveness, together form what we call bharat ka darshan or the idea of india. the question before us is: will the constitutional vision triumph or will we surrender to the ideology of division and polarisation?, “if the other vision succeeds, the country will disintegrate and the idea of india will collapse. india cannot be destroyed; we will not allow it to be destroyed…”, — nitish kumar, june 20, 2013, when a political alliance re-emerges from the debris of an earlier break-up, the reunion unfailingly prompts a journalistic revisit to the past — to the time when the partners said the foulest things to each other and swore eternal hate and enmity. the ritual, meant to expose the hypocrisy on either side, was expectedly repeated when bihar chief minister nitish kumar walked out of his alliance with the lalu prasad-led rashtriya janata dal and walked into the eager arms of the narendra modi-amit shah-steered bharatiya janata party (bjp)., it had indeed been a bitter parting of ways between mr. kumar and the bjp in 2013. mr. kumar said he would disappear into the bowels of the earth but not engage with mr. modi. such was his contempt for the then gujarat chief minister that he felt it an affront even to take his name. in mr. kumar’s angry imagination, mr. modi occupied the same dark space as j.k. rowling’s lord voldemort, “he who must not be named.”, also readthe story behind the mahagathbandhan break-up , the story behind the mahagathbandhan break-up, yet there was a standout piece in the swirl of accusations. mr. kumar’s june 20, 2013 speech, made in the bihar assembly while seeking a fresh vote of confidence, rose above petty grievances to raise fundamental questions about india and its future. the speech, extracts of which are quoted above, summed up exactly what it was that mr. kumar rejected when he ended his 17-year-long partnership with the bjp., on one side, he said, was the plural and inclusivist constitutional vision, and on the other a destructive counter vision (obviously that of mr. modi) founded on the politics of division and polarisation. and he, nitish kumar, would not allow the latter to succeed: “let me promise you: we will never allow the politics of division to destroy this country.”, having treated his rupture with the bjp as a service to the country, as a personal sacrifice to prevent its ideological colonisation, worse its likely vivisection, mr. kumar today tells us that there is no issue more important to him than the corruption of mr. prasad and his young son and former deputy chief minister, tejashwi yadav. mr. kumar’s decision to preserve himself rather than the country he was once prepared to die for shows, of course, that his affected moral superiority notwithstanding, he is cut from the same cloth as the rest of the political crowd. but this is not all there is to this speedy journey from secular absolutism to sectarian iffiness. if today mr. kumar’s conscience allows him not only to name “he who must not be named” but also embrace him in full view of the world, it is because he has realised that prime minister modi is all there is to india’s politics. any political future there is is only with him, especially with the muslim vote, an earlier necessity, no longer a factor in ‘secular’ electoral calculations., also read where is the opposition in india? tabish khair , also read , , where is the opposition in india? , the fact that the bjp in power has pretty much followed the scary script mr. kumar envisioned in 2013 is obviously no longer a matter for concern. in the more than three years since mr. modi won a record majority, the bjp has moved closer and closer to the rashtriya swayamsewak sangh’s’s dream of a hindu rashtra — not in the sense of a formal theocracy but in the sense of a nation hindu in all respects, numerically, culturally and above all for being able to claim a 5,000-year-old civilisational legacy. this antiquity of culture and land demanded that all inhabitants acknowledge their common hindu ancestry and agree too that this ancestry overrode any subsequent conversion to islam or christianity., the hindu aggression implicit in this formulation was always a threat to minority citizens but perhaps never more so than now with the ruling regime seen to be unapologetically majoritarian both in its politics and policies. mob lynchings of mainly muslims may appear to be unconnected to state policy but these in fact stem from a state-promoted prioritisation of cows over human lives and the proscription of beef as a food choice. the assertion of hinduness is evident in all spheres, cultural, social and even individual, and in politics in the increasing and unconscionable marginalisation of muslims. the bjp’s candidate list for this year’s uttar pradesh assembly election did not have a single muslim, signalling the arrival of muslim-free electoral politics., this is the mirror opposite of the ideal mr. kumar held up in 2013. even on corruption he has turned out to be on slippery ground with the surfacing of scams in bjp-run states, earlier in madhya pradesh and more recently in maharashtra and chhattisgarh. it should be evident to anyone that the vyapam recruitment scandal with its startling cash-crime-multiple murder angle hasn’t been sufficiently investigated. the bjp seems able and willing to explore alliances with parties unknown for their financial probity, among them the all india anna dravida munnetra kazhagam and the nationalist congress party. remember mr. modi calling the latter the “naturally corrupt party?” the right to information act, which had thoroughly and ruinously exposed the united progressive alliance’s corruption, has been given a quiet burial., can it be mr. kumar’s case that opposition corruption is corruption but bjp’s corruption is so much hogwash? that is an absurd argument. but that is exactly what mr. kumar has willed himself to believe, and with him an ever growing constituency of mr. modi’s supporters. the private tv channels have morphed into vicious opposition-eating beasts. ideally they would like to beam mr. modi’s activities 24 into 7. but that would mean sparing the opposition, the decimation of which has to be a higher calling. the modi government’s dismal record on the economy, the devastating consequences of demonetisation, a failing farm sector and the deteriorating situation on the borders have paradoxically all added to the popularity of mr. modi and established that people will believe the wildest untruth if it is wrapped in “nationalist colours”. this narrow nationalism is co-opting an ever widening circle of people, with dissenters shamed as traitors and worse. an astonishing number of people today believe mr. modi can at once defeat pakistan and china.",-0.0034022556390977464,mood moment : collective targeting opposition,"“we said person leads country secular , vision inclusive growth. country constituted constitution whose basic values , egalitarianism , pluralism inclusiveness , together form call bharat ka darshan idea india. question us : constitutional vision triumph surrender ideology division polarisation?

2018-10-11,polls and polarisation politics,"the political discourse, as assembly elections approach, is slipping to new lows. addressing a rally in madhya pradesh recently, the president of the bharatiya janata party (bjp), amit shah, once again described infiltrators as “termites”. earlier, speaking at a rally in rajasthan, he said that he was confident that the bjp would win every election despite incidents of mob lynching, naming mohammed akhlaq. at the party’s national executive meeting last month, he had declared that if the bjp comes to power in 2019, it would stay put in office for another 50 years. , but what is the basis of this self-confidence in the face of the poor record in office and the unravelling of the party’s own carefully constructed social constituency? this self-assurance stems from the belief that a politics of polarisation will pay dividends. development and corruption were two major poll issues in 2014 when narendra modi projected himself as the harbinger of development. both these issues have lost their appeal as non-hindutva supporters who backed the bjp on the promise of development are disenchanted. the bjp appears to be refurbishing its strategy with greater prominence given to hindutva, reflected in the high-pitched communal rhetoric of the past few months. , that this strategy is driven from the top is evident from the manner in which the bjp president has been focussing on the national register of citizens (nrc) issue, which is ideally suited to create polarisation. mr. shah has set the pace for this. while raising the issue of the nrc in a rally in gangapur town in sawai madhopur, he said that ‘crores of illegal infiltrators’ have entered the country like ‘termites’ and should be ‘uprooted.’ he has been sticking to this theme in several speeches, warning for instance: “bjp sarkar ek-ek ghuspaithiye ko chun-chun kar matdata suchi se hatane ka kaam karegi (the bjp government will remove every infiltrator from the voters’ list).” , the ‘chun-chun ke nikalenge’ threat to the illegal bangladeshi immigrants becomes clearer when viewed together with the proposed citizenship (amendment) bill of 2016. this bill would permit hindus, sikhs, buddhists, jains, parsis and christians from afghanistan, pakistan and bangladesh to be eligible for indian citizenship, but not muslims, and if passed would violate article 14 guaranteeing equality before law. through this, the bjp is aiming to polarise indians to convince them that what is rightfully theirs is being snatched away by ‘outsiders’. hence, mr. shah is bringing up the issue in rally after rally to target minorities. at a public meeting in kolkata, on august 11, he asked: “are the bangladeshi infiltrators a security threat to this country or not?”, such acidic comments are echoed by other bjp leaders in their mobilisation campaigns. the sharpened focus on bangladeshi immigrants, the nrc, the 2106 surgical strikes on pakistan, to name a few such issues, are an indication of the tone and tenor of the bjp’s combative political strategy for 2019. the nrc issue is particularly important for its political agenda as it signals the shifting relationship between the indian state and its diverse citizens and communities on questions of citizenship, equality and democracy., several commentators point out that the bjp has begun to forefront a combative strategy because of the growing feeling that the ruling dispensation is unlikely to repeat the 2014 performance. at the same time, it’s important to remember that polarisation has been an indispensable part of its campaign strategy, and is embedded in its ideology. for the bjp, creating a hindu-muslim divide is at the heart of its quest for a hindu consolidation. many state elections after 2014 have witnessed aggressive pitching of divisive issues rather than development. this happened during the gujarat and uttar pradesh elections in 2017. same was the case in bihar in 2015 and karnataka in 2018. moreover, this type of campaign is always conducted at the grass-root level by the rss-bjp cadres even when on occasion the top leadership is speaking a less divisive language. whether the communal dimension should be highlighted by the leaders in their speeches depends on the assessment of the ground situation and its intensity varies from phase to phase of the election campaign., from independence, india’s politics had taken the form of a consensus pertaining to issues about nationhood and majority-minority relations. clearly, that consensus has broken down, with the bjp keen to break away from the traditional national discourse. in the past too, religion wasn’t divorced from politics since it is part of the political landscape, but it is certainly more strident now. one important reason for the democratic regression is the majoritarianism promoted by the bjp as the dominant ideology since it came to power. the second reason is growing incidents of mob lynchings, which have emerged as a critical element of the new political order. it is not conventional hindu-muslim violence but targeted violence that is no longer episodic but a continuum, with lynching of muslims on issues ranging from allegations of cow slaughter to love jihad to petty theft. most of these incidents are perpetrated by vigilante militias and are the direct result of the communal atmosphere that the hindu right has created, leaving little scope for recourse to justice against persons who commit these hate crimes.
