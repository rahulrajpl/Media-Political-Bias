pampa river basin,’’ says dr. thomas p. thomas, academic and environmentalist., talking to the hindu, dr. thomas who was also a member of the fact-finding team that had recently visited njunangar alleged that there was every reason to suspect the direct river treatment proposed by the kerala state pollution control board (pcb) a ploy to dump the chemical waste of an ernakulam-based private company in the serene sabarimala forests., in his statement published in the hindu dated december 21, mr. s.d. jeyaprasad, pcb chairman, said the direct river treatment was started in 2007 in order to reduce the coliform count in the njunagar stream. “however, he conveniently sidelines the fact that the river treatment using coagulants only helps in the settling of the suspended particles in the sewage and not effective in reducing the coliform count in the stream. the coliform count can be reduced only by disinfection process which is not practical in the njunangar stream as chlorine may react with organic compounds in the sewage to form substances which may be carcinogenic,’’ says dr. thomas., heavy metals, “pcb chairman has admitted that the ferrous chloride supplied by a private

2010-11-07,kodungalloramma - 1968,"epic story: left, p. kannamba as kannagi in the tamil versionof the epic. | photo credit: scan kochi , the malayalam film ‘kodungallooramma' was an adaptation of the legend of kannagi, a character from the tamil-jain epic and morality tale ‘chilappathikaram' written by ancient tamil poet ilango adigal during 1st century ad. the story is about the revenge of kannagi against the injustice inflicted to her husband kovalan by the ruler of the pandya kingdom. the legend of kannagi was staged as musical operas throughout south india., the first known musical opera based on the epic was ‘kovalan charitham' (1914) written by the tamil poet and dramatist k. v. udayara pillai the musical opera was staged successfully throughout south india. this was perhaps the earliest tamil musical opera to be staged in kerala. the popular playwrights of malayalam musical opera p. k. velu pillai and k. r. neelakanta pillai came up with malayalam versions of this legend in 1921 and 1924 respectively. both the stage plays were performed by prominent troupes very successfully., in 1928 guarantee film corporation produced a silent film ‘kovalan,' directed by r. s. prakash. this is probably the first film version of the ancient tamil epic. the very next year general pictures corporation came up with a silent version of the story titled ‘kovalan' or ‘the fatal anklet,' directed by a. narayanan. the tamil film produced by imperial film corporation in 1933 with leela and narasimha rao in the lead roles was the first sound film based on the epic story., the tamil film ‘kannagi' (1942) produced by jupiter pictures and directed by r. s. mani is considered as the best film adaptation of the epic. the performance of the singing star of early tamil and telugu cinema, pasupaleti kannamba as kannagi remains her best and perhaps one of the best in the history of tamil cinema. the character of kannagi is figured in popular legends in tamil nadu and sri lanka and was subjected to various mutations down the centuries in poetry and theatre. but as an icon, kannagi came to be identified with p. kannamba's image after the tremendous success of the 1942 film. even some of the statues of kannagi that adorn junctions and public places in tamil nadu seems to have been modelled on kannamba., in 1964 kannagi's story was remade in tamil as ‘poompuhar' with m. karunanidhi's script and dialogues. however, the performance of vijayakumari as kannagi did not impress. the film flopped. the impressive dialogues written by karunanidhi for the film is reflected in those written by jagathi n. k. achari for the malayalam film ‘kodungallooramma'. the film was directed by m. kunchacko., the story of the malayalam film deviates from the tamil epic ‘chilappathikaram' and the various film and stage versions in certain aspects. in some of the film versions kannagi is portrayed as the incarnation of goddess parvathi who was made to descend to the earth following a curse by lord shiva. there is no such mention in the malayalam film. further, the malayalam film co-relates the epic story with the history of the famous temple at kodungalloor where the presiding deity is bhagavathi. the special effects scenes in which the city of madurai is set to fire failed to impress. the music composed by k. raghavan (raghunath in the title cards) was the highpoint of the film., the film opens with a scene where devotees are seen worshipping the goddess at the famous kodungalloor bhagavathi temple. the story of kannagi follows as the flash back. kovalan (prem nazir), the son of a wealthy merchant (thikkurissi) of kaverippoompattanam in the chola kingdom marries kannagi (k. r.vijaya), a woman of legendary beauty. the young couple live happily until kovalan meets a dancer madhavi (jyothilakshmi) and falls in love with her. in his infatuation for the dancer kovalan forgets his wife and gradually spends all his wealth on madhavi., kovalan becomes penniless and is expelled from madhavi's house. kannagi, the loyal wife, receives her husband. they leave their hometown and reach the neighbouring pandya kingdom. the only asset left with them is kannagi's anklets filled with precious stones. kannagi offers to sell one of her anklets to help kovalan start his business., the anklet of the pandya queen is stolen. kannagi's anklet, which kovalan attempts to sell, is mistaken to be that of the queen's. kovalan is arrested and brought before the royal court. kovalan is beheaded by royal command. kannagi avenges herself by proving the king was mistaken. while the queen's anklet was filled with pearls kannagi's anklet was filled with rubies. the king and the queen die of remorse. kannagi in her anger sets the entire pandyan capital town of madurai to fire. she leaves the pandya kingdom and reaches the neighbouring chera kingdom. king chenkuttavan, of the chera kingdom, worships kannagi and builds a temple for her at kodungalloor. the film ends with a scene showing kannagi as the presiding deity in the temple., the kodungalloor episode in the legend of kannagi, as shown in the malayalam film, has no reference in the tamil epic or in any historical document. it remains just an ancient belief. there is no similar reference in any of the earlier stage or screen versions of the epic., k. r. vijaya's performance as kannagi was impressive, but of course, was no match to the classic performance of p. kannamba. the comedy scenes involving adoor bhasi, s. p. pillai, adoor pankajam etc. adversely affected the highly charged and sentimental theme

2010-12-19,managing the anticipated food crisis,"a street vendor selling vegetable near kochi on friday. heavy rain and consequent crop losses in certain parts of karnataka and tamil nadu coupled with an increasing demand in the south indian markets have pushed up vegetable prices to double, 40 to 60 per cent rise over the last few months in kerala market. market sources said that the price was not expected to come down until the second half of january as the winter and sabarimala season sees a peak in demand in most parts of the state,photo : k_k_mustafah.26/11/2010 | photo credit: k_k_mustafah , the food and agriculture organisation of the united nations (fao) has alerted developing countries about possible steep rises in food prices during 2011, if steps are not taken immediately to increase significantly the production of major food crops. according to fao, “with the pressure on world prices of most commodities not abating, the international community must remain vigilant against further supply shocks in 2011.” world cereal production is likely to contract by 2 per cent during 2010 and global cereal stocks may decline sharply. the price of sugar has reached a 30-year high while international prices of wheat increased by 12 per cent in the first week of december, 2010, as compared to their november average., the quantitative and qualitative dimensions of the under- and mal-nutrition prevailing in our country are well known. the steering committee of a high level panel of experts on food and nutrition set up under my chairmanship to advise the un committee on food security (cfs) recently concluded what we need urgently is a comprehensive coordinated approach, not piecemeal approaches, to tackling chronic, hidden and transitory hunger. this is also the lesson we can learn from countries which have been successful in combating hunger such as brazil which, under its “zero hunger” programme, has achieved convergence and synergy among numerous nutrition safety net programmes. to some extent, this is what is being attempted under the proposed national food security (or entitlements) act of the government of india., what should be our priority agenda for 2011 on the food front? at least six areas need urgent and concurrent attention. first, the national policy for farmers placed in parliament in november 2007, on the basis of a draft provided by the national commission on farmers (ncf), should not continue to remain a piece of paper, but should be implemented in letter and in spirit. this is essential to revive farmers' interest in farming. without the wholehearted involvement of farmers, particularly of young as well as women farmers, it will be impossible to implement a food entitlements act in an era of increasing price volatility in the international market. the major emphasis of the national policy for farmers is imparting an income orientation to agriculture through both higher productivity per units of land, water and nutrients, and assured and remunerative marketing opportunities. the green revolution of the 1960s was the product of interaction among technology, public policy and farmers' enthusiasm. farmers, particularly in north west india, converted a small government programme into a mass movement. the goal of food for all can be achieved only if there is similar enthusiastic participation by farm families., second, every state government should launch a “bridge the yield gap” movement, to take advantage of the vast untapped yield reservoir existing in most farming systems even with the technologies currently on the shelf. this will call for a careful study of the constraints — technological, economic, environmental and policy — responsible for this gap. the rs.25,000-crore rashtriya krishi vikas yojana of the government of india provides adequate funding for undertaking such work both in irrigated and rainfed areas. enhancing factor productivity leading to more income per unit of investment on inputs will be essential for reducing the cost of production and increasing the net income. scope for increasing the productivity of pulses and oilseed crops is particularly great. the programme for establishing 50,000 pulses and oilseed villages included in the union budget for 2010-11 is yet to be implemented properly. the cost of protein in the diet is going up and pulses villages will help to end protein hunger., there are outstanding varieties of chickpea, pigeon pea, moong, urad and other pulses available now. what is important is to multiply the good strains and cultivate them with the needed soil health and plant protection measures. the gap between demand and supply in the case of pulses is nearly 4 million tonnes. we should take advantage of the growing interest among farmers in the cultivation of pulses, both due to the prevailing high prices and due to these crops requiring less irrigation water. such high value, but low water requiring crops also fix nitrogen in the soil. before the advent of mineral fertilizers, cereal-legume rotation was widely adopted for soil fertility replenishment and build-up., third, the prevailing mismatch between production and post-harvest technologies should be ended. safe storage, marketing and value addition to primary products have to be attended to at the village level. home science colleges can be enabled to set up training food parks for building the capacity of self-help groups of women in food processing. a national grid of ultra-modern grain storage facilities must be created without further delay. in addition to over 250 million tonnes of food grains, we will soon be producing over 300 million tonnes of fruits and vegetables. unless processing and storage are improved, post-harvest losses and food safety concerns will continue to grow., we should also expand the scope of the public distribution system by including in the food basket a whole range of underutilised plants like millets and, where feasible, tubers. the ncf pointed out that eastern india is a sleeping giant in the field of food production. the sustainable management of the ganges water machine (this term was first used by professor roger revelle) will provide uncommon opportunities for an evergreen revolution in this area. fortunately chief minister nitish kumar is taking steps to make bihar the heartland of the evergreen revolution movement in this region. the ganges water machine is capable of helping us to increase food production considerably, provided we utilise ground water efficiently during rabi and replenish the aquifer during kharif., four, a nutrition dimension should be added to the national horticulture and food security missions. hidden hunger caused by the deficiency of micronutrients like iron, iodine, zinc, vitamin a and vitamin b12 can be overcome at the village level by taking advantage of horticultural remedies for nutritional maladies. popularisation of multiple fortified salt will also be valuable, since this is both effective and economical., five, a small farm management revolution which will confer on farmers operating one hectare or less the power and economy of scale is an urgent need. there are several ways of achieving this and these have been described in detail in the chapter titled, “farmers of the 21st century” in the ncf report. we need to foster the growth of a meaningful services sector in rural india, preferably operated by educated young farmers. the services provided should cover all aspects of production and post-harvest operations. group credit and group insurance will be needed. contract farming can be promoted if it is structured on the basis of a win-win situation both for the producer and the purchaser., finally, there is need for proactive action to minimise the adverse impact of unfavourable changes in climate and monsoon behaviour and to maximise the benefits of favourable weather conditions. for enabling farmers to develop a “we shall overcome” attitude in the emerging era of climate change, we need to set up in each of the 128 aqro-climatic zones identified by the indian council of agricultural research a climate risk management research and training centre. these centres should develop alternative cropping patterns to suit different weather probabilities. they should develop methods of checkmating potential adverse conditions. along with a climate literacy movement, a woman and a man from every panchayat and nagarpalika will have to be trained as climate risk managers. we will then have over half-a-million trained climate risk managers, well versed in the science and art of climate change adaptation and mitigation. such a trained cadre of grassroot climate risk managers will be the largest of its kind in the world., the present year is ending with damage to rice and other crops in andhra pradesh and tamil nadu due to excess of rain towards the end of the crop season. farming is the riskiest profession in the world since the fate of the crop is closely linked to the behaviour of the monsoon. even if there is assured irrigation source, natural calamities like cyclones, hail storms and very heavy showers take their toll. the national monsoon mission proposed to be taken up with the participation of u.s. expertise will certainly help to refine the prediction of weather as well as the status of crops and commodity prices. also, the mahatma gandhi national rural employment guarantee programme provides unique opportunities for strengthening our water security system through scientific rain water harvesting and watershed management. this valuable benefit can however be realised only by integrating technology with labour. once a national grid of climate risk management research and training centre comes into existence, it will be possible to build up seed banks of alternative crops, which can be grown if the first crop fails. drought and flood codes should specify the action possible at the end of such calamities. for example in the flood affected areas, soil moisture will be adequate to grow a short duration fodder crop or a vitamin a rich sweet potato.",0.09541747322235128,managing anticipated food crisis,"street vendor selling vegetable near kochi friday. heavy rain consequent crop losses certain parts

2011-01-14,over 55 die as tragedy strikes sabarimala pilgrims in idukki,"over 55 people were killed at pulmedu near vandiperiyar in kerala’s idukki district on friday night, the climactic day of the sabarimala pilgrimage season, in a series of tragic incidents. the bizarre sequence apparently began after at least one accident involving a bus or a jeep, and led to a panic reaction verging on a stampede among pilgrims in the forested and hilly area. about 90 people were believed to have been injured. some early accounts spoke of a much higher death toll., the tragedy occurred between 9 p.m. and 10 p.m. the pilgrims were returning after witnessing the “makarajyothi”. it was believed that a number of them are from tamil nadu., the weeks-long makaravilakku season was particularly crowded this time and major traffic hold-ups had been reported over the past few days., initial reports reaching the state capital suggested that a vehicle carrying pilgrims rammed another and overturned., this reportedly triggered a stampede. health minister p.k. sreemathy told the hindu that ambulances and doctors from five nearby districts have been rushed to the vandiperiyar government hospital. medical college hospitals in the state were put on alert, she said., district authorities have opened a control room in kumily. the telephone numbers are 04869-222049, 252244., our kottayam correspondent adds:, idukki district authorities said most of the victims were from karnataka, tamil nadu and andhra pradesh. according to them the death toll may go up., while authorities had taken all security measures in major centres like sannidhanam, pamba and other areas, uppupara and pulmedu areas, nearly 35 km from the sannidhanam, had remained unsecured., these areas had witnessed unprecedented arrival of pilgrims during the past few days and thousands had set up temporary camps to witness the makarajyoti. with the absence of power and other infrastructure, the commotion that followed the accident snowballed into one of the worst stampedes in the history of the state., the accident site lies about 25 km from vandiperiyar town on the kottayam-kumily road and the last few kilometers are connected by a dirt road inside the forest. though the accident had occurred around 8.15 p.m., the first information trickled in only by 10 p.m., the remoteness of the mishap site hampered rescue operations and it took more than three hours to take the victims to the nearby hospitals as the vehicles carrying them were caught in the traffic jam on account of the heavy outflow following the conclusion of the makara vilakku celebrations., when three of the seriously injured pilgrims arrived at the kottayam government medical college hospital, it was past 2.15 a.m. on saturday. a few others have been moved to the government medical college in theni, tamil nadu., pti adds:, “fifty five bodies have so far been recovered from the site”, which is a remote area on the border with tamil nadu, kerala education minister m.a. baby said., pathanamthitta district superintendent of police sanjay kumar said up to 100 people were killed. at least 100 people were also injured, many of them seriously, in the incident., mr. baby said most of the people died in the stampede which broke out after the accident at 8.15 p.m. “we are not in a position to specify at this stage how many were killed by the jeep and how many perished in the stampede,” mr. baby added., the minister said the jeep went out of control and crashed into the crowd of pilgrims, resulting in a stampede., video footages of the accident site in a heavily forested hilly terrain in the periyar tiger reserve on the western ghats showed panic-stricken people shifting the dead and the injured., mr. baby said most of the pilgrims involved in the tragedy were from tamil nadu and other states who were returning to their homes to celebrate pongal after having a darshan of the deity at the hill shrine., there were also a few malayalees among the dead, he said adding chief minister v.s. achuthanandan has directed the idukki district administration to provide speedy relief to the injured., fifty five bodies were taken to vandiperiyar hospital in idukki district while some of the injured were rushed to the kottayam medical college (kerala) and the theni medical college in tamil nadu, officials said., sabarimala special commissioner rajendra nair said a jeep had ploughed through the pilgrims, who were returning from ""makara samkrama pooja"", using a narrow trekking path at a place

2011-01-17,sabarimala tragedy,"as an ardent pilgrim who has been visiting the sabarimala shrine for 25 years, i can say that a stampede of the sort that occurred on january 14 — claiming 102 lives — can take place at any point of time anywhere on the hill. the main reason is that the authorities cannot judge the crowd pouring in on a particular day. moreover, pulmedu — where the tragedy struck — is a forest route which very few know of and which has very poor infrastructure., the devaswom board, with the help of local ayyappa seva sangams, can introduce a registration procedure for the pilgrims. the group leader or “guruswamy” can take the responsibility of registering his team. the date on which the group will reach the shrine and through what route can thus be tracked. through better planning and organisation, stampedes can be prevented in future., k.l. gangadharan, chennai, each sabarimala pilgrimage season brings crores of rupees to the kerala government. the least a pilgrim would expect are basic amenities and safety arrangements. that only four policemen were present at pulmedu where the stampede occurred is unbelievable., shambhu soman, kollam, that there is a phenomenal growth in the number of devotees visiting sabarimala during the makarajyothi every year is well known. the kerala government has the foremost responsibility of anticipating the numbers and making arrangements to meet any eventuality. no doubt, the hill terrain is difficult for crowd management. but precautionary measures would have surely prevented the major accident on friday., on their part, devotees should be patient in mass assembling centres. it appears that immediately after the darshan of the celestial light at ponnabalamedu, thousands of devotees hurried down the hill and passed through the congested pathway. the haste with which they moved might have caused the tragedy, with the geographical constraints adding to it., sasidharan uppath, palakkad, governments do not seem adequately prepared to deal with the consequences of massive crowding. clearly, a good deal of mismanagement must have been involved in the latest tragedy at sabarimala. given the sheer number of devotees every year, the kerala government should have illuminated the forest path through the idukki district which is usually taken by pilgrims returning from the shrine., k.s. jayatheertha, bangalore, this is not the first time that a stampede has taken place in sabarimala. similar tragedies have taken place in the past, including in 1999. unfortunately, we are none the wiser. the authorities seem to have reached a dead end in finding a lasting solution., i attribute the failure to the acts of omission on the part of the government. caution is thrown to the winds and accidents continue unabated. while it is true there is no armour against fate, disasters can be avoided if prevention is made a top priority., k.g. koru kuttan nair, malaysia, media reports clearly show that we have not learnt any lessons from the past. it was not merely the dense forest or the lack of illumination that led to the tragedy, though it might have played a part. the basic reason is the reluctance on the part of the police to tackle the huge task in all earnestness. the fact that four constables were posted to look after thousands of devotees on their return journey is an indication of the casual attitude of those in charge of security. had there been a minister among the pilgrims, hundreds of policemen would have been in attendance to ensure his safety., i say this on the basis of my own experience with the police in andhra pradesh. i retired as a depot manager in apsrtc after 33 years of service. wherever a big jathra operation was conducted, we had to beg the police to post adequate police but very few personnel were allotted for the task. the police are unwilling to work on queue. they prefer to get posted near the temple entry point or near the commercial stalls erected for the jathra. those tasked with managing the crowd are reluctant. it is not hi-fi technology or huge manpower that is needed to avoid such tragedies. the will to work and

2011-01-21,"makarajyothi is man-made, aver leaders","the sabarimala temple complex (circled) surrounded by forests, as seen from ponnambalamedu, a hill-top east of the sannidhanam. it is here that the makarajyothi is traditionally sighted on makaravilakku day. the square cement platform here, used to light fire, was built by the travancore devaswam board in the 1990s, it has now been stated. this picture was taken in 2006 after an arduous climb through the shoal forest along with certain officials, with due permission. but since then it has become a highly restricted spot. photo: radhakrishnan kuttoor | photo credit: handout_e_mail , is the makarajyothi man-made, the kerala high court asked on thursday, about the phenomenon long associated with the climactic moment of the annual makaravilakku pilgrim season at the sabarimala shrine in kerala. the hindu on friday posed the question before a number of prominent persons closely associated with, or seek to represent the interests of, the revered and ancient forest-shrine. the answer: it is indeed man-made., the president of the travancore devaswom board (tdb) that administers the temple, a senior member of the pandalam palace that is traditionally associated with the ayyappa temple, and the chief priest (tantri) at the ayyappa temple, have clarified their stand on the ‘makarajyothi darshan' seen at ponnambalamedu, a remote hilltop situated some 8 km (as the crow flies) from the sabarimala sannidhanam, on makaravilakku day every year., tdb president m. rajagopalan nair said the light sighted at ponnambalamedu was man-made, but added that the board itself had no role in creating it. according to him, it is believed that in the olden days, forest-dwellers in and around ponnambalamedu used to celebrate the makaravilakku festival at the hilltop. the lighting of a lamp at ponnambalamedu on makaravilakku day has become an annual affair even after the forest-dwellers vacating the place in later years, he added. however, mr. nair restrained his comments, saying that the tdb would be submitting its report on the issue before the kerala high court soon, as required by it on thursday., the pandalam palace managing committee president, p. ramavarma raja (whose letter to the editor sent in on january 20 is published in the letters column elsewhere in this issue), and the senior tantri of the temple, kandararu maheswararu, also clarified that the light sighted at ponnambalamedu was man-made., according to the tantri, the bright star ‘makara' that appears on the horizon above the holy hillock of the sabarimala sannidhanam on ‘makaravilakku' day is the ‘makarajyothi,' and not the light lit at ponnambalamedu as has been “publicised by certain quarters.”, both mr. raja and the tantri were of the opinion that the lighting of the lamp at ponnamabalamedu was a continuation of a practice followed earlier by the tribal families who lived near the hill-top. however, the ppmc president was of the view that the term makaravilakku has no association at all either with the celestial star or the lamp lighted at ponnamabalamedu. “the pandalam palace does not give any importance to the makarajyothi, which was the creation of certain vested interests with a hidden agenda to downplay the most important event of deeparadhana offered to the deity decorated with the sacred thiruvabharanam sacred ornaments brought from the pandalam palace, on makaravilakku day,” mr. raja added., according to him, vilakku is an old malayalam usage for a temple festival, and makaravilakku is referred to the temple festival at sabarimala on the day of makara-sankramom., ayyappa seva sanghom national vice-president d. vijayakumar said it was a fact that the lamp lighted at ponnamabalmedu is “man-made and a matter of faith.” if the tdb is lighting the lamp atop ponnambalamedu, the tdb and the government that had constituted the temple administrative body are bound to ensure the safety of the multitude that throng the sacred grove of lord ayyappa for ‘jyothi' worship, mr vijayakumar said. according to him, interference by the judiciary and the government in a matter relating to religious faith was not a healthy trend., kummanam rajashekharan, hindu aikayvedi general secretary, said makarajyothi, whether it is man-made or not, has found adivine religious niche in the minds of every ayyappa devotee. “makarajyothi, and ponnambalamedu which is considered as the original base of sabarimala temple, are realities and part of a strong religious belief. it was the tdb that had constructed a cement platform at ponnambalamedu, where the ancient ayyappa shrine of the forest-dwellers stood, a few years ago on the basis of the prescriptions at an astrological consultation (devaprasnom) held at sabarimala, earlier,'' he added. mr. rajashekharan said that the tdb, with the knowledge of the kerala high court, had constructed the platform to conduct ceremonial offerings there on the makaravilakku day, immediately after the deeparadhana at the sabarimala ayyappa temple. he alleged that certain quarters were trying to divert public attention from the pulmedu stampede tragedy by creating a controversy over makarajyothi., nair service society secretary g. sukumaran nair said that the lighting of the makarajyothi at ponnambalamedu is believed to have been part of a religious ceremony of the forest-dwellers in the olden days. the tribal people in the area were forced to resettle on the forest fringes later. ponnambalamedu is the original base (moolasthanom) of the sabarimala ayyappa temple and hence performing deeparadhana there should not be made a controversy,” he said., sree narayana dharma paripalana yogam general secretary vellappally natesan alleged that certain vested interests were trying to make makarajyothi a centre of controversy with a hidden agenda to divert attention from the failure of the government and the tdb in ensuring the safety of pilgrims at pulmedu. “devotees have little interest to know who is lighting the makarajyothi at ponnambalamedu. their minimum requirement is adequate basic facilities at sabarimala and pulmedu for

2011-01-21,on makarajyothi,"following the pulmedu incident in which 102 sabarimala pilgrims died on january 14, the controversy over makarajyothi and makaravilakku has been naturally rekindled., some describe a star that appears on the eastern horizon, roughly coinciding with the arrival of the thiruvabharanam from pandalam palace to adorn the ayyappa deity at sabarimala and the subsequent deeparadhana, as makarajyothi. some others consider a light, far away within the eastern forests around the same time and appearing three times, makarajyothi. for still others, makarajyothi is the sum total of the star and the light., while the star in consideration can be called makarajyothi by reason of the care being bestowed on it on the 1st of makaram at the sannidhanam, it shall be specially noted that the term makarajyothi is in use only for less than about 40 years in the 1000-year history and legends of the sabarimala temple. this, by itself, may be one reason for the controversy., greater opposition to this lies in the act of misleading the devotees by pouring extra divinity of a heavenly lamp into the flickering light while the government, the travancore devaswom board and other vested interests keep mum, without openly declaring and publicising that the lamp is man-made. this is exploiting the belief of the devotees, that the devas perform deeparadhana at ponnambalamedu to coincide with the deeparadhana of lord ayyappa, adorning the holy ornaments., whether a light appeared or not, the pilgrims present at the sannidhanam paid their obeisance, turning to that direction. until the present set-up came into place, there was no regularity of any sort in the appearance of the lamp and, on most occasions, there used to be no light at all. this light appearing some times was a sort of deeparadhana, conducted by some group of forest dwellers. upon the belief of a deeparadhana and/or upon the sight of a light, if the devotees chant the names of ayyappa, i do not find anything wrong. the controversy is in the matter of misleading people. now that the tribals have been thrown out of their dwellings and the exhibition of the light has been taken over by vested authorities who ensure its quality, number of appearances and tv transmission, the sanctity of the show is lost., the pandalam palace does not give importance to makarajyothi, coined recently to serve vested interests. for his own reasons, the tantri refers to the star as makarajyothi. there can even be a hidden agenda to decrease the importance and sanctity of the deeparadhana of lord ayyappa, with the holy ornaments brought from pandalam., the term makaravilakku is ancient. but it does not carry its original meaning now. it is unfortunate that even the tantri has not cared to find out the truth in the controversy. actually, by makaravilakku is meant the festival on the day of makarasamkramam including the procession from malikappuram to pathinettampadi, with caparisoned elephant and other paraphernalia. note that in many temples in kerala, the festival days are known as vilakku. the festival in sabarimala used to begin after makarasamkramam with flag-hoisting, and end on the sixth with guruthi. all the paraphernalia for the ceremony are brought from pandalam. in olden days, devotees invariably stayed back to witness at least a day's festival. an unwanted turn in the sabarimala festival is that the tdb is changing the days of the festival to its will and convenience in the name of devaprasnam or without it. while facts stand thus, regularising, strengthening and publicising the once-in-many-years visible light and elevating the same as makaravilakku, ignoring the original makaravilakku, can be part of the hidden agenda. under the pressure of the controversies, if any changes are suggested, they shall not worsen the present position and shall avoid all chances of hidden agenda and misleading of the people. the history of tdb proves its incapacity to deal with the situation., p.r.v. raja, president, pandalam palace managing committee, pandalam, kerala, while makarajyothi is a shining star, makaravilakku is a bright light seen on the makaravilakku day at ponnambalamedu. now, people believe that both are the same. ensuring makaravilakku is not the job of the authorities. if they are really concerned about the welfare of the devotees, they should build pilgrim shelters across the state, providing basic amenities at nominal charges., t.k. harinarayanan, kozhikode, it is absolutely important to make a distinction between makarajyothi and makaravilakku. it is time the facts were brought out as the number of pilgrims to sabarimala is increasing year after year., r.k. kutty, bhopal, that the kerala high court has asked the tdb to clarify whether or not the makarajyothi is a man-made phenomenon is surprising. the celestial light is based on faith and is being honoured by ayyappa devotees for ages. the light has nothing to do with legal issues. no one moved the court on the origin of the jyothi. the deaths caused due to the stampede had nothing to do with the origin of the jyothi. it was

2011-01-24,on makarajyothi,"p. ramavarma raja, pandalam palace managing committee president, has clearly told us about the makarajyothi appearing on the sabarimala from the eastern forests, and his word should be treated as final on the topic. a very senior civil servant and a guruswamy who took me with him to sabarimala in 1962 gave me the same version but i did not believe him then. mr. raja has given a clear answer to the query raised by the kerala high court — whether the makarajyothi is man-made — and the government can now concentrate on crowd management., what mr. raja has disclosed will not, in any way, diminish the sanctity of the sabarimala shrine or the importance of the star that appears on the horizon on makarasankranthi., c.p. chandra das,, germantown, maryland, all organisers are well aware that the jyothi is man-made. they have not publicised the information all these years. the photo of the cement platform used to light the fire is an excellent contribution by the hindu to its readers. one hopes the crowd will decrease next year and the tdb will be able to manage it. let us appreciate the fact that it is humanly impossible to manage a crowd of about three crores in five days and nobody can be blamed for any unforeseen tragedy. ayyappa devotees should understand that the entire month (december-january) is auspicious., k.r.k. prabhakara murty,, vijayawada, i wish to congratulate the hindu on publishing the photograph of the ponnambalamedu. the media should take the initiative to educate pilgrims on the makarajyothi. it is obvious that many who assembled on january 14 at pulmedu did so for a glimpse of the jyothi. the television channels in kerala which vie with one another in bringing exclusive reports of the jyothi are silent., k. narayanan,, udupi, the hindu deserves praise for publishing the report on the makarajyothi, which has been a cause of various debates spanning over a decade. the sensitive matter has been hanging fire for too long. i hope the reports will put an end to all myths and rumours. there is absolutely no room for any further controversy., i also hope the political parties in kerala will not blow the matter out of proportion and play with the common man's sentiments., sumesh balachandran,, kochi, i thank mr. raja for his clarifications. the media and politicians should stop drawing mileage from the makarajyothi issue. all religions and places of worship have some mythological stories associated with them. it is the faith of the masses which draw them to these places. it would do a world of good if the debate on the makarajyothi ended. instead of playing the blame game and passing the buck, the kerala government and the tdb should work to ensure that the january 14-type tragedies do not recur., kala kalyanram,, coimbatore, the controversy is out of context and ought to have been avoided. every religion has its sets of beliefs and it will do no good to seek proof for them., as far as i can remember, the dewaswom board, the temple authorities and the families of tantris have, at no point of time, claimed or even stated that the makaravilakku seen atop ponnambalamedu is divine. it is a belief cultivated by people over time. however, this is not the belief of all devotees — many are aware that the light is man-made. lighting a lamp on top of the ponnambalamedu is just a part of the overall makaravilakku celebrations., a. venkateswaran,, chennai, true bhakti is not based on miracles. everybody knows that the tiruvannamalai deepam is lit by people. does that make it any less holy? lord ayyappa is the lord of satya and dharma in kaliyuga. i regularly undertake a pilgrimage to the sabarimala not to see any miracle, but to observe the viradam (regimen) associated with it to the best of my ability and surrender myself to the swamy unconditionally. and may i add that he has made me witness many a miracle in my personal life!, g. manogar,, chennai, the debate on the makarajyothi is diverting people's attention from the main issue of stampede. why stir up a hornet's nest? let people believe what they have believed in for ages. how does it matter to the government?, p.r. sruthi,, malappuram, the hindu has done well to publish opinions from relevant authorities on the makarajyothi, supporting them with a photograph. the makarasankranthi is auspicious and it is logical that people worship the deity on that day. agni is considered a purifying god. almost all hindu temples have fire-related rituals. they make the gatherings emotional. the purpose is to enable the devotees to concentrate on god. the fire lit in ponnambalamedu serves a similar objective., this aspect should be given adequate publicity to avoid mishaps at sabarimala in future. at the same time, the worship of ayyappa is extraordinarily pristine with or without the lighting of a fire at ponnambalamedu.",0.14918367346938774,makarajyothi,"p. ramavarma raja , pandalam palace managing committee president , clearly told us makarajyothi appearing sabarimala eastern forests , word treated final topic. senior civil servant guruswamy took sabarimala 1962 gave version believe then. mr. raja given clear answer query raised kerala high court — whether makarajyothi man-made — government concentrate crowd management. , mr. raja disclosed , way , diminish sanctity sabarimala shrine importance star appears horizon makarasankranthi. , c.p. chandra das ,, germantown , maryland , organisers well aware jyothi man-made. publicised information years. photo cement platform used light fire excellent contribution hindu readers. one hopes crowd decrease next year tdb able manage it. let us appreciate fact humanly impossible manage crowd three crores five days nobody blamed unforeseen tragedy. ayyappa devotees understand entire month ( december-january ) auspicious. , k.r.k. prabhakara murty ,, vijayawada , wish congratulate hindu publishing photograph ponnambalamedu. media take initiative educate pilgrims makarajyothi. obvious many assembled january 14 pulmedu glimpse jyothi. television channels kerala vie one another bringing exclusive reports jyothi silent. , k. narayanan ,, udupi , hindu deserves praise publishing report makarajyothi , cause various debates spanning decade. sensitive matter hanging fire long. hope reports put end myths rumours. absolutely room controversy. , also hope political parties kerala blow matter proportion play common man ' sentiments. , sumesh balachandran ,, kochi , thank mr. raja clarifications. media politicians stop drawing mileage makarajyothi issue. religions places worship mythological stories associated them. faith masses draw places. would world good debate makarajyothi ended. instead playing blame game passing buck , kerala government tdb work ensure january 14-type tragedies recur. , kala kalyanram ,, coimbatore , controversy context ought avoided. every religion sets beliefs good seek proof them. , far remember , dewaswom board , temple authorities families tantris , point time , claimed even stated makaravilakku seen atop ponnambalamedu divine. belief cultivated people time. however , belief devotees — many aware light man-made. lighting lamp top ponnambalamedu part overall makaravilakku celebrations. , a. venkateswaran ,, chennai , true bhakti based miracles. everybody knows tiruvannamalai deepam lit people. make less holy ?

2011-01-30,sabarimala: the tragedy and the remedy,"vast concourse: the facilities in sabarimala are not enough to meet the needs of the crores of devotees who visit the shrine every pilgrim season. file photo , the tragedy that struck sabarimala pilgrims on makarasankranti claiming 102 innocent lives, is horrendous in magnitude. the pilgrims returning after a fulfilling darshan of the jyoti could never have thought that death was awaiting them on the hillslopes. but any perceptive observer who visits sabarimala during the festival season beginning in mid-november and concluding on the day of sankranti, would be able to say that this was a tragedy waiting to happen., no official or unofficial records are available to show when pilgrimage to sabarimala started. it always remains a mystery how a temple came to be built in this most difficult terrain infested with wild animals. there is no human habitation anywhere near it. in the 1950s and earlier, a pilgrim had to walk barefoot 65 km through dense forest and trek seven steep hills to reach sabarimala. he was always in danger of being attacked by wild animals. so, the pilgrims moved in large groups and in the night they would camp in the midst of a dense forest and build huge fires, fire crackers and beat drums to scare away animals., trekking through a thorny and stony forest track and climbing steep hills involving physical suffering is associated with the sabarimala pilgrimage. the pilgrims chant, “thorns and sharp stones are like pads on our feet.” the mystic and rarefied experience of sabarimala cannot be understood by an observer unless he goes through it. the collective chants, “swamiye saranamayyappa,” coming from millions of pilgrims, send powerful vibrations all around the hills which are called the “magnetic hills.” interestingly, the deity is called “kantamala jyoti,” meaning the sacred light of the magnetic hills. no wonder, sabarimala, which is said to be a powerful energy field, attracts tens of millions of devotees. no other religious centre in the country is visited by such a large number of pilgrims during one season lasting for just over two months., the unprecedented surge in the number of devotees year after year has created enormous problems in regard to infrastructure, crowd management, provision of basic facilities, maintaining hygiene, traffic movement and related issues., it is universally accepted that the travancore devaswom board, which manages the temple, is not able to fully meet the ever-growing needs of the pilgrimage. non-availability of enough land is only one problem. land is not made available for expanding the infrastructure because sabarimala's ecology is fragile and large-scale construction activities will irreparably damage it. moreover, it is part of the periyar tiger sanctuary and therefore there are serious constraints on development activities near the shrine., years ago, this writer took a daring step by taking the public accounts committee of parliament headed by sardar buta singh to sabarimala, that too on the day of makarasankranti, when the crowd is at its peak. after surveying the scene, where millions of devotees were sleeping on the open ground next to one another in the night, mr. singh said he had never seen anything of this nature in his life. he said he couldn't imagine that people could endure hardships with such peace and sense of fulfilment. he promised to do everything possible to bring about minimum development in sabarimala. incidentally, this was the first time a parliamentary committee ever visited the shrine., sabarimala, visited by crores of pilgrims, lacks basic amenities. devotees standing in the queue for 15-20 hours for darshan do not have facilities for even answering the call of nature. it is humanly impossible for people to keep standing for such a long time without food or water and a place to sit or stretch their weary limbs. pilgrims include old men and women and children. certain minimum arrangements can be made to help them., temporary hutments with thatched roof can be put up along the route to provide them clean drinking water and eatables. chairs or benches can be provided in these hutments for them to rest a while after hours of standing. makeshift lavatories can be installed behind these hutments. once the season is over, these hutments can be dismantled easily. these arrangements will not disturb the forest or ecology, but will be of immense help to the pilgrims., different routes, a major problem is controlling the flow of devotees who take different traditional and non-traditional routes. the tragedy took place at pulmedu, which is one such route. the media have reported that there were just three or four policemen and the number of pilgrims who converged at this place when the tragedy struck was over two lakh. the surge cannot be stopped, but regulation of the inflow and movement should be possible. reports about the absence of any kind of facility to save human lives in an emergency like this are in a way not surprising, given the general attitude towards the sabarimala pilgrimage. since suffering is thought to be part of the pilgrimage, it suits us to ignore the basic requirements of a pilgrim centre., the pac under buta singh recommended that a master plan be prepared for scientific development of sabarimala without in any way damaging ecology. in pursuance of that idea, an expert body was set up to study the problems and suggest short-term and long-term remedies. the pac visit generated some momentum which, however, does not seem to have been sustained., the travancore devaswom board is doing whatever it can. but it is set in its traditional ways and, because of its structure and outlook and the peculiar politics of kerala, it seems unable to internalise the urgency and the need to manage problems using modern and scientific methods., what is required is urgent implementation of the master plan. individual initiatives have been taken from time to time to improve things. for example, mr. jayakumar, additional chief secretary of kerala and well-meaning and competent officer, took steps to make the trek a little less painful and risky and maintain hygiene in and around the temple. in fact, after the visit of the pac, a number of meetings with officials of the central and state governments were held and an expert committee was set up. but no one knows what happened thereafter. the unseemly sight of pilgrims being roughly and mercilessly pushed in front of the sanctum sanctorum by policemen preventing them from catching even a fleeting glimpse of the deity encapsulates the problems of sabarimala. the devotees of lord ayyappa never protest; they endure all kinds of hardships. this is the assumption on which sabarimala has been managed always., (the writer is a former secretary-general of the lok sabha)",0.051617826617826615,sabarimala : tragedy remedy,"vast concourse :

festival, ‘kerala coir 2011', at the ems stadium here on friday, mr. sudhakaran said the government had decided to enhance the minimum wages with support from the income support scheme for coir workers that was announced in the previous state budget. this would ensure that coir workers got minimum wages irrespective of the fluctuations in the market, he said., stating that the government was moving ahead with its modernisation plans for coir sector, mr. sudhakaran said efforts were on to open about 1,000 de-fibering mills to deal with the shortage of coir fibre. he added that the efforts to do away with the depot system had proved successful with coir cooperative societies now being able to interact directly with exporters and obtain justified prices for their coir products. the price stabilisation scheme too was paying dividends, he said, adding that what remained an eyesore was the neglect by the public works department officials towards coir geo-textiles., for durable roads, coir geo-textiles had proved to be effective in giving roads an extended lifespan, the minister said, citing the roads to sabarimala. however, the inexplicable neglect by the pwd and the reluctance of certain groups in the department to use coir geo-textiles was nothing less than “cruelty” to the coir sector and were preventing the sector from gaining advantage of a proven technology, he said., earlier, inaugurating the festival, state planning board vice-chairman prabhat patnaik said both technological and organisational changes were essential in the coir sector to ensure minimum wages for coir workers, without the unpredictable market fluctuations troubling them., a committee to decide the price at which yarn should be purchased and sold by a government agency would soon be set up, while the government should also think about a single agency for purchase and sale of yarn, so as to ensure justified and reasonable prices and minimum wages., stating that the future of the coir

2012-11-11,aranmula hopes for a smooth take-off,"the project site of kgs aranmula international airport. photo: t.e. raja simhan , this is one project that is generating considerable attention even before it could take off. coming up in the serene settings of ‘god’s own country’, the kgs aranmula international airport is attracting as much attention for being the first such private facility as for weathering a storm in the face of opposition from a section of the locals., the opposition is about use of wet lands, levelling of paddy fields for the runway, and threat to environment., project promoter, kgs group, however, does not seem to be unduly worried. “the opposition to the project is very minimal. the protests haven’t slowed us,” declares gigi george, managing director, kgs aranmula international airport ltd., 700-acre project, stating that government projects also face heat, he says that the project, coming up on 700 acres at aranmula in pathanamthitta district of kerala, has acquired all required clearances. they include approvals from the union ministries of civil aviation, environment and forests, defence and home affairs besides those from the kerala government., on the viability of the airport project, located between the international airports of kochi and thiruvananthapuram, mr. george says the idea is not to thrive on diverted traffic. one of the conditions on which an airport project is approved is that two-thirds of the traffic has to be generated on its own. this is possible, he adds, due to the proximity of aranmula airport to sabarimala, the second largest pilgrim centre in india that attracted 60 million pilgrims in 2011, and tourist destinations such as kumarakom and the backwaters of alappuzha., a majority of nri (non-resident indian) passengers and nrk (non-resident keralites) passengers of the two existing airports nearby originate within 50 km radius of the upcoming facility. moreover, it would be serving the four districts of pathanamthitta, kottayam, idukki and alappuzha, which together account for 40 per cent of kerala’s air traffic., initial investment, it will be a privately-owned and managed airport, mr. george says. the terminal building will be designed to handle 1,000 passengers simultaneously, he adds. the project, which has an initial investment of rs.2,000 crore, will also comprise shopping malls, star hotels and a multi-speciality hospital., the state government is likely to pick up a stake in the airport project. “we had discussions recently, and there is a possibility of the state government taking a 10-15 per cent stake,” he says. getting various government approvals isn’t easy, he argues., the company also intends to promote the airport as a regional hub to one of the airlines based in the middle east. “now, there is no hub for them in india as there is no private airport, and the airports authority of india could not give permission to one and deny it to another. we have spoken to some of them and everybody is keen,” he replies to a query on the role for emirates airlines in the project. air arabia, he adds, is one of the airlines looking at a hub in india. kgs aranmula international airport ltd. is also confident of malaysia airports, the technical and strategic partner for the project, to help in marketing the facility., the return on investment is expected to be around 18-20 per cent, mr. george says. unlike some other private airports, this will not see unnecessary spending, he adds. “we will spend only what is required. we do not want to get into a situation where we spend more and overcharge the customer,” he explains. operations at the aranmula airport are expected to begin by the end of 2014. on the opposition, particularly to the levelling

2013-01-17,don’t like this temple? choose another,"do we want to create a world in which everyone thinks alike? a world in which there is no space for divergence of views or foolish people? i write this after witnessing poor rahul easwar, one of the young hereditary priests of sabarimala, being flagellated on television for the nth time on january 7, 2013, for allowing the presiding deity of his temple to shun the company of female devotees., the media’s job is first and foremost to inform and not browbeat people to “reform.” tv news programmes in particular have come to resemble inquisitions or kangaroo courts with anchors and their hand-picked panellists flagellating those with politically incorrect views, issuing diktats on everything from political views to religious practices and rituals, and even the conduct of gods and goddesses., intolerant, just as our colonial rulers with their faith in the superiority of their monotheistic faith, despised hindu religious practices, with their millions of gods and goddesses, our modern day missionaries can’t stand the temperamental nuances of our diverse deities. they have no problem in accepting that women are barred inside friaries meant to house catholic priests who have taken a vow of celibacy. but they can’t stomach the idea of a male deity who has likewise vowed eternal celibacy avoiding the company of women. they take it upon themselves to cure this kink because in their moral universe with its borrowed vocabulary, this amounts to misogyny and gender discrimination!, rahul easwar has asked each television anchor who has grilled him over the years how would they deal with all those temples which only allow female devotees, where the presiding goddess forbids men’s entry. would they likewise force “women only” temples to open their doors to men? not one has ever condescended to answer this simple question; nor did any of the anchors tone down their aggression or hostility towards rahul’s intelligent defence of his faith and his ishta dev., following in the footsteps of our british rulers, who despite their disdain for our gods and goddesses, took away shiploads of priceless ancient idols to display as art objects in their museums and living rooms, so also our westernised elites have taken to displaying paintings, bronze and stone carved idols of diverse gods and goddesses as decoration pieces in their homes as proof of their aesthetic lifestyle. but their disdain for those who treat them as objects of worship remains as ferocious as that of our colonial rulers., respect for differences, if that were not the case, they would have no difficulty in appreciating that hindu divinities are not unknowable, distant entities. they have distinct personalities, character traits, likes, dislikes. even in matters of food, floral offerings, puja ritual, each deity has his or her preferences. if you don’t respect their unique temperaments, you are free not to worship them and choose the devata or devi that suits your taste., even the most illiberal among indians do not insist on uniformity of rituals or modes of worship. they let each faith group, each sect decide for itself how to define their relationship to their chosen deity, what foods to offer her, what modes of worship they think appropriate to express their devotion and how they interpret her likes or dislikes. this spontaneous, mutual respect for differences in ways of being, ways of worship, singing, dancing, clothing, cooking and so on, is what enabled the rich diversity of india to survive through millennia., but our self-proclaimed modern liberals can’t deal with these lived forms of diversity. they can only relish in museumised versions such as folk dances on republic day or as consumer goods. for example, possessing a collection of kanjeevaram, ikat, chanderi or patola saris, madhubani and worli paintings, moradabad brassware, wood carvings from kashmir, tanjore paintings, rajasthani miniatures, etc. is a fashion statement. but the moral universe of those who create these diverse art objects is unacceptable. it is assumed that they all need a dose of reform to cleanse them of antiquated beliefs and values., for engagement, i won’t be surprised if tomorrow someone decided to reform the food habits of our gods and goddesses saying, for example, that modak and laddoo are both high cholesterol, high calorie food items. they encourage devotees to have pot bellies. therefore, they should be banned in favour of sugar-free diet chocolates!, it is time the imperious missionaries of “liberalism” understand that our temples are not meant to be tourist centres — where entry must be free for all. most of our traditional temples are run by specific sects for the devotees of that particular deity. if you don’t like the values of that sect, if the preferences of that particular deity are offensive to you, just avoid going to that temple. there are lakhs of others to choose from., if i walked into the homes of our self-appointed reformers and insisted that they change their lifestyles and food habits, i’d be shown the door and asked to mind my own business. what gives these non-believers the right to dictate to lord sabarimala how he should live and act in his own abode or dictate terms to harmless little sects among hindus who prefer to indulge in the whims and wishes of their chosen deities?",0.16814331360249726,’ like temple ?

2013-01-31,just a matter of belief?,"a response to madhu kishwar’s article “don’t like this temple? choose another” in the hindu, 17 january 2013), dr. madu kishwar’s approach to the question of the entry of female devotees into the sabarimala temple merits attention, as it is representative of a popular viewpoint. while our disagreements with kishwar are not new in terms of evidence or argument, as illustrated by a large body of scholarly work, it is worth reiteration nevertheless. this is particularly in the light of the fact that every time a new issue on the question of religion in public life comes up, we need not start from the basics., kishwar argues that hindu deities have temperamental nuances, which believers are obliged to satisfy. non- believers have no right to interfere in these practices, because their ‘liberal’ ideas are ‘imported from the west’. for instance, misogyny and gender discrimination for her are part of a borrowed vocabulary of the ‘imperious missionaries of liberalism’ , the ‘westernised elite’ who treat idols as art objects, and who want temples to be turned into tourist centres free for all. she insists that hinduism is uniquely accommodative of diversity, and people are free to choose any deity with any ritual/temperamental preferences. further, if the preferences of any particular deity are offensive to anybody, the matter can be settled by just avoiding visits to that temple., our disagreements to such an understanding can be summed up in the form of a few basic questions. first, are believers a homogenous community? is such a community not marked by persistent structures of power and exploitation? second, what is kishwar’s understanding of religious reform? who are the agents in such a process? third, are all believers illiberal or are all liberals non-believers? fourth, where are the temperamental nuances of deities derived from? fifth, is choice in religion as porous and passive as the author makes it to be?, it is important to problematize the uncritical characterisation of a ‘community of believers’ vis-a-vis ‘non- believers’, which is based on the assumption that faith contributes to the creation of a homogenous group. there have been instances of prolonged violence between various sects belonging to the ‘hindu fold’ across the country, not divorced from political and economic considerations of dominant groups, from time to time. besides, the emergence of bhakti and other religious movements of dissent has been a response to the ritualistic, rigid and exclusionary practices of vedic brahminism. they have been expressions of democratisation in the arena of religion. scholars who studied the institutionalisation of such movements have pointed out the continuing persistence of caste and gender divisions even within them, forcing us to question the idea that a community of believers is impervious to social structures or history. if the boundaries of choice in hinduism were as porous as the author makes it out to be, it is worthwhile to ask why thousands of dalits under the leadership of babasaheb ambedkar left the hindu fold and embraced buddhism. why have marginalised groups historically converted out of hinduism with the hope of transcending its discriminatory strictures?, even a cursory glance at the history of religious reform in india reveals a contested terrain. for instance, the temple entry agitation in kerala was not just a mobilisation in favour of the right of temple entry, but also a call to end civil disabilities of lower castes in general. the movement saw the participation of religious reformers, political leaders and huge sections of peasant and working class populations. in short, the agitation was not an internal affair of the ‘community of believers’, but part of the larger movement to end caste based oppression., kishwar’s argument presumes that the hindu tradition is essentially one of a basic unity within diversity, while eminent historians have amply proved that the case is otherwise. it is important to understand that the staunchest advocates of a unification of hindu belief and practice, the apologists for a hindu book, a hindu god and a hindu ritual system are the hindu right (note for instance, the insistence on cow protection despite significant sections being consumers of beef). it has, in addition, tried to impose such a unificatory ideal through the use of violence, coercion and also the portrayal of the ‘other’ as the enemy., the article indulges in a number of collapses, like that of non-believers and liberals, and of western and liberal. the process of reform has not been one of a mechanical response to ‘external stimuli’. streams of indian philosophy have articulated varied traditions of materialism and scepticism, and even atheism. the basis for the argument of the inherently western nature of concepts like rationality is then flawed. is the willingness to blindly accept dominant diktats on religious practice a prerequisite for being considered ‘non-western sons and daughters of the soil’?

2013-12-15,"fish, fish and some more fish","the day's catch: the busy chambakkara fish market during the wee hours of the morning. photo: thulasi kakkat , daybreak is a hint in the sky. the morning is an angry grey and proximity to chambakkara fish market a strong smell in the air. it is a little after 5.30, and except for the sunday mass on at st. james church, opposite the market in poonithura, there is no sign of activity. in the darkness the backwaters are just a suggestion; the dark outline of a chinese fishing net in the sky seems to form a logo for the market., the market at that time of the day is a visual experience. the amount of fish and the sheer variety defies imagination and expectation. fish, fish and then some more fish, some familiar and most complete strangers. anchovy (kozhuva), sardine (mathi), mackerel (ayela), threadfin bream (kilimeen), tilapia (thilopia), barracuda (sheelavu), tuna (chura)–wax white, silver, pink, brown, white, black, spotted, long, tiny, fat–there is every kind of fish. they eerily gleam in the half light of bulbs and cfl lamps., chambakkara market is today a major hub in the city’s fish trade but in the distant past, it is said, it was a trading hub with coir as the primary commodity. traders and buyers from adjacent areas participated in the trading. today it is mainly fish., fish are neatly arranged on blue plastic sheets, the smaller fish in mounds, the big fish laid out and the bigger fish chopped into half. the business takes place in the open, outside shops. the makeshift stalls have blue plastic sheet, again, more a covering than a roof. on either side of the path are fish for sale., in another corner of the market, fish is being unloaded, thermocol boxes with fish are being cut open and the rhythmic chant of auctioning of fish ‘boxes’ (the kind fish mongers carry on their bikes) provides the background score., most of these, “cent per cent” says a trader, come from outside. he shines a torch light on a box of pearl spot, “look at the karimeen. where do you think they are from?” he asks. the improbability of it rules out china, so andhra pradesh it is. maharashtra, goa, orissa and tamil nadu are the other places that put fish on our plates., ‘naadan’ fish (locally caught) is sold on one side of the market. but there is very little of it. “fish such as neimeen and moda come from places such as munambam and chavakkad,” says martin m.v., one of the main agents in the market. there are around six to eight agents, who procure fish, like him in the market, he says., the market, wholesale and retail, opens at 5 a.m. the fish reach the market at night and the ‘wares’ are ready for sale. some reach after 24-hour train journeys and others by truck. “the fish are packed immediately after being caught and are shipped. for example, from mumbai fish reaches here by road in 36-38 hours,” martin says. the fish are dropped off on the way to the markets in places such as ettumanoor and muvattupuzha, which have night markets (wholesale)., as buyers (fish mongers) haggle for a bargain, men with black pouches slung across their shoulders jot down the dues in small diaries–buyer’s name, quantity of fish and the money due–every transaction is duly recorded. these are representatives of the agents. some partially-open shops serve as agents’ offices., surprisingly, for a place with so much fish, there is no stench inside the market. apart from fish the other presence is water from the melting ice. hence folded mundus and rolled up pants. by the time it is 6.30 a.m., the retail buyers start trickling in. mondays are busy days because on sundays fish wholesale markets in other places are closed., pramila, a fish monger from kanjiramattom, buys fish daily from radha who has a business in the market. a discussion on the price and margin of profit elicits a defensive “i have to live don’t i?” she assures she doesn’t double the price., this time of the year business is dull, says shamsuddin, a trader. there are very few buyers that day, “the fasting seasons of sabarimala and christmas” he says., a stall which sells dressed fish and is the ‘face’ of the market, isn’t open. a few shops selling bags, knives, ropes, magazines and other things are open. cheera (spinach) sellers arrange bouquets of green and maroon, there are lemons and green chillies too.",0.03782241428368187,"fish , fish fish","day ' catch : busy chambakkara fish market wee hours morning. photo : thulasi kakkat , daybreak hint sky. morning angry grey proximity chambakkara fish market strong smell air. little 5.30 , except sunday mass st. james church , opposite market poonithura , sign activity. darkness backwaters suggestion ;

in adapting carnatic music to the puppetry idiom. sankaranathan, 89, who no longer tours with the troupe, learned the art from his foster father mani iyer, and was trained formally in music by ‘violin’ rajamanickam pillai., tough competition, the rich heritage notwithstanding, murugan says it is getting harder for his troupe to compete for the attention of audiences more used to electronic entertainment. “in the olden days, we used to do plays based on harishchandra. then it moved on to valli thirumanam and plays of sankaradas swamigal. now, my father and i have prepared some 10-15 stories more suited to our times. epic characters arunagiri nathar, sabarimalai ayyapan, siruthondan nayanmar and bhakta prahalada are all featured, but sometimes we have to listen to the audience too. in a village, for example, when they ask for cinema songs, you have to oblige, whether you approve of it or not,” he says., so, along with puppets (mostly 3-feet high and weighing around 10-15 kilos) togged out in traditional costumes, the troupe has also got characters in more updated wardrobes., vanishing patronage has truncated several other traditions as well., “performances are no longer three to four hours’ long. we are down to a little under two hours these days. we’ve had to trim the orchestra too – i take care of the dialogue and keyboard (that has replaced the harmonium) while we have one person to play the mridangam,” says murugan. “as you condense for the sake of the budget, you also end up overloading one artiste with the work of many,” he rues., works of art, bommalattam puppets are among the largest and most ornate dolls of their kind in india, and it wouldn’t be wrong to call them works of art in their own right. “a bommalattam artiste has to know not just about dramatics, music and puppetry, but also be a good carpenter,” says murugan, whose younger brother ravi is in charge of producing the dolls used in the theatre. another brother gopi assists him with the show production, while son karthikeyan is learning the ropes as he balances his college studies with the family occupation., the head, body and limbs of the puppet are made separately out of the lightweight ‘kalyana murungai’ (indian coral tree) wood, and then reinforced with moulding paste and paint before they are connected with the help of wires. the embellishments add to the weight of the dolls. the strings for manipulation are tied to an iron ring which the puppeteer wears like a crown on his head., some of the more ‘modern’ puppets are manipulated with the help of two sets of strings, one for each hand of the puppeteer., as gopi unpacks a male puppet from a canvas kit bag, and demonstrates a simple namaskaram, eyes light up in the circle of onlookers., “your shoulders start paining within 10 minutes in a show, because of the weight of the puppets,” says gopi. “we keep changing the artistes behind the curtain, to give them enough time and energy to keep the show going without a break.”, still in the field, it may look rudimentary, but bommalattam has managed to incorporate elements of variety hall entertainment and slapstick comedy to keep audiences engaged., sri murugan sangeetha bommalatta sabha has been performing for the erstwhile ramnathapuram royal family for 70 years without a break, and it is a regular invitee to the sri subramanya swami devasthanam in kumara vayalur village for the past 38 years., its puppets have starred in films like indian, avarampoo, sigappu malargal and manthira punnagai., the troupe is now working on a new play on ramanujam, for which 60 puppets will be required. “we will be making 10 new puppets, and will add the 50 we already have to the ‘cast’,” says murugan., a new puppet takes up to two months to make, and the most basic doll costs around rs. 30,000. repairing broken dolls can be costly too, at rs. 10,000 a pop., often overlooked in official folk art forums, murugan likens bommalattam to “a lamp within a pot whose light cannot be seen.” proof of its antiquity may be found in its mention in the thirukkural, as also in anecdotal legend of how thiyagaraja swamigal gave up writing songs in ananda bhairavi raga after it was sung exquisitely by bommallatam exponent atmaraman., “both man and doll are prone to damage and have a limited life span. till then, we must do the best we can as human beings,” concludes murugan., brief biography, a flair for the arts",0.1463519578350087,puppets perform,"bommalattam exponent t. s. murugan ( dark green shirt ) troupe ahead show tiruchi recently.photo

2016-01-15,the case against customary exclusion,"on january 18, the supreme court will hear final arguments on the question of whether women can be barred entry to the sabarimala shrine in kerala. during the hearing on january 11, justice dipak misra indicated that he was broadly sympathetic to women’s claims to entering and worshipping at the shrine. he is reported to have said , “unless you i.e. the governing board of the shrine have a constitutional right to prohibit women entry, you cannot prevent them from worshipping at the shrine.”, these remarks have caused quite a stir. in particular, justice misra’s reference to the constitution, and his suggestion that its non-discrimination clauses might be applicable to this dispute, raise some complex questions about the relationship between freedom of religion, equality, individual rights, and the extent to which the court can interfere in the management of religious institutions., room for state intervention, the history of the framing of the constitution is a history of conflicting and clashing philosophies. the constitution's fundamental rights chapter grants rights to individuals against the state, to individuals against other individuals, to groups and communities against the state, and as a final layer, allows the state to restrict these rights for various reasons of social and public interest. tension between these various provisions is inevitable, and is perhaps reflected most starkly in the religious freedom clauses: articles 25 and 26. article 25(1) guarantees to all persons the right to freely profess, practise, and propagate their religion. mirroring this, article 26(b) grants to religious denominations the right to manage their own affairs in the matter of religion. overriding both these provisions, article 25(2) allows state intervention in religious practice, if it is for the purpose of “social welfare or reform or the throwing open of hindu religious institutions of a public character to all classes and sections of hindus”. during the debates in the constituent assembly, b.r. ambedkar — supported, among others, by rajkumari amrit kaur, who expressed specific concerns about the plight of women under religious law — endorsed giving wide, interventionist powers to the state on the ground of the deep and pervasive role that religion played in the lives of indians. “the religious conceptions in this country are so vast that they cover every aspect of life, from birth to death,” he observed, “i do not think it is possible to accept a position of that sort. there is nothing extraordinary in saying that we ought to strive hereafter to limit the definition of religion in such a manner that we shall not extend beyond beliefs and such rituals as may be connected with ceremonials which are essentially religious.” over the years, the supreme court has itself restricted the scope of the religious protection clause to “essential practices of a religion”. while holding that the state cannot use the reform clause to “reform a religion out of existence”, it has nonetheless held that aspects beyond essential practices have no protection from state intervention. , why does this matter? it matters because the sabarimala governing board’s argument is that the prohibition of women is justified by “custom” . they rely upon the kerala hindu places of public worship (authorisation of entry) rules, 1965, which permit prohibiting women from accessing places of worship where “custom” or “usage” requires it. during the january 11 hearing, justice misra doubted the existence of any such custom. the court’s previous jurisprudence suggests that the burden upon the board will not merely be to establish the existence of a custom, but also that the custom is “essential” to the practice of the religion., what if the board fails? if it cannot show that prohibiting women from entry is an essential religious practice, then it can no longer claim absolute immunity under article 26(b). conversely, however, the women worshippers can argue that prohibiting them from access violates their right to worship under article 25(1). it has long been accepted by the supreme court that the right to worship, as well as modes of worship, are protected by article 25(1). while the court, admittedly, has held that the right to worship does not extent to worshipping in any and every place, it has also noted that access to places having a “particular significance for a particular religion” is constitutionally protected., if, therefore, the women worshippers can demonstrate that the sabarimala shrine has special and unique religious significance, their article 25(1) right to worship there stands established. the board’s prohibition upon their entry, consequently, impermissibly violates their constitutional right to freedom of religion., the state and the shrine, that does not, however, entirely resolve the issue. the right to freedom of religion under article 25(1) is enforceable against the state, and not against other individuals, or corporate bodies. the question that the court must answer therefore is whether the travancore devaswom board, which controls access to the shrine, can be equated to the “state”., in fact, in an earlier decision, the kerala high court already appears to have held that it can. previously, the supreme court has held that corporate bodies that are “functionally, financially and administratively” under the control of the state can be equated to the state for the purposes of fundamental rights. the travancore devaswom board is an autonomous body. while its members are appointed by the state legislature, it derives its main income from the administration of the temple. therefore, it might be difficult to argue that the board is functionally or financially under the control of the state. and if the board cannot be equated with the state, then the constitutional right under article 25(1) is not enforceable against it.",0.07243492063492063,case customary exclusion,"january 18 , supreme court hear final arguments question whether women barred entry sabarimala shrine kerala. hearing january 11 , justice dipak misra indicated broadly sympathetic women ’ claims entering worshipping shrine. reported said , “unless i.e. governing board shrine constitutional right prohibit women entry , cannot prevent worshipping shrine. ” , remarks caused quite stir. particular , justice misra ’ reference constitution , suggestion non-discrimination clauses might applicable dispute , raise complex questions relationship freedom religion , equality , individual rights , extent court interfere management religious institutions. , room state intervention , history framing constitution history conflicting clashing philosophies. constitution ' fundamental rights chapter grants rights individuals state , individuals individuals , groups communities state , final layer , allows state restrict rights various reasons social public interest. tension various provisions inevitable , perhaps reflected starkly religious freedom clauses : articles 25 26. article 25( 1 ) guarantees persons right freely profess , practise , propagate religion. mirroring , article 26( b ) grants religious denominations right manage affairs matter religion. overriding provisions , article 25( 2 ) allows state intervention religious practice , purpose “social welfare reform throwing open hindu religious institutions public character classes sections hindus ” . debates constituent assembly , b.r. ambedkar — supported , among others , rajkumari amrit kaur , expressed specific concerns plight women religious law — endorsed giving wide , interventionist powers state ground deep pervasive role religion played lives indians. “the religious conceptions country vast cover every aspect life , birth death , ” observed , “i think possible accept position sort. nothing extraordinary saying ought strive hereafter limit definition religion manner shall extend beyond beliefs rituals may connected ceremonials essentially religious. ” years , supreme court restricted scope religious protection clause “essential practices religion ” . holding state cannot use reform clause “reform religion existence ” , nonetheless held aspects beyond essential practices protection state intervention. , matter ?

2016-01-18,"reform, only left to the judiciary?","last week, the supreme court declared that it would hear a public interest litigation (pil) on whether women of menstrual age can be denied the right to enter the ayyappa temple in sabarimala, kerala. the bench, in its observation to the kerala government and the temple authorities, remarked that “unless >you have a constitutional right, you cannot prohibit entry to women.”, in 1993, the kerala high court had held that the travancore devaswom board, the authority that manages the sabarimala temple, could restrict access to women who were in the 10-50 age group. it had concluded that the “restriction imposed on women aged above 10 and below 50 from trekking the holy hills of sabarimala and offering worship at sabarimala shrine is in accordance with the usage prevalent from time immemorial,” and that “such restriction imposed by the devaswom board is not violative of articles 15, 25 and 26 of the constitution of india.” this is the position that the supreme court will revisit early next month in the context of arguments of gender equality and fundamental rights. in doing so, it will yet again wade into the paradoxical waters of a secular state making religious policies., no strict religion-state separationunlike any other secular state, the republic of india was conceived with a mandate for social revolution. this makes our situation unprecedented and unique. we do not have a “wall of separation” between religion and state that, for instance, exists in the united states. furthermore, the founders of the indian republic have enjoined the state to intervene in social customs and redress grievances arising out of them so that all citizens can equitably enjoy their constitutional rights and privileges. this is evident in the way article 25, which deals with >freedom of religion, is constructed. unlike other articles dealing with the fundamental rights, it begins with caveats (“subject to public order, morality and health and to the other provisions”) before stating the right (“all persons are equally entitled to freedom of conscience and the right freely to profess, practise and propagate religion”.) it goes on to empower the state to regulate and restrict non-religious activities associated with religion. it allows the state to make laws “providing for social welfare and reform or the throwing open of hindu religious institutions of a public character to all classes and sections of hindus”. interestingly, the term “hindus” here includes “persons professing the sikh, jaina or buddhist religion”. the rights of religious minorities are protected under subsequent articles. the asymmetries that arise from these articles are causes of grievances, disgruntlements and contestations that vitiate our politics to this day., why did the wise people who drafted a remarkably liberal, secular and modern constitution decide to give the state so much power over religion? the words of dr. b.r. ambedkar, chairman of the drafting committee, give us some insight. arguing for a minimalist definition of what constitutes religion — and hence needs to be kept outside the domain of the state — he held that “the religious conceptions in this country are so vast that they cover every aspect of life, from birth to death. there is nothing which is not religion and if personal law is to be saved, i am sure about it that in social matters we will come to a standstill.” in other words, a strict separation between religion and state would have prevented the constitution from carrying out social revolution., in the early decades of our republic, the supreme court evolved an “essential religious practices doctrine” that spelt out the outer limits of what could be called the sole domain of religion. unfortunately, over the years, this doctrine was interpreted in an elastic, and sometimes arbitrary manner. judges gave themselves the power to determine what constitutes essential religious practice not just for one religion, but for all of them., india might be the only republic where the judiciary can pronounce on matters not only relating to law, but also those concerning theology. thus, courts have ruled on topics like the >jain practice of santhara (voluntary fasting to death); and on who can and cannot become an archaka (priest). they have even pronounced on rather vexed questions like what should be the shape of the markings on the temple elephant’s head., the higher judiciary’s decisions are seen as legitimate among the public because of the relative credibility it enjoys. judicial activism and encroachment into legislative and executive domains add to its popularity. thus, we should not be surprised if the supreme court declares that the sabarimala temple must be thrown open to women of all ages., gender equality vs. judicial overreachif it does, it will be seen as another victory for the cause of gender equality, even if only a miniscule proportion of women are likely to ever exercise that right. even women who are in a position to visit the temple might choose not to do so out of a certain regard for norms and practices. and some may choose to visit and society, traditions and norms must change to accommodate them., yet, we should be wary of a judiciary that encroaches on more domains, even for causes we consider as desirable and good. “caesaropapism” is a term used to describe a state of complete subordination of religion to the secular state. india runs the risk of being in thrall of a variant of this, a condition that can be termed “judiciopapism”, where judges can completely overrule religious authority. with each judgment that shrinks the scope of what is considered an “essential religious practice”, the risk grows., why should we care?

2016-02-26,back to the roots,"utkarsh patel | photo credit: 27dmc utkarsh , from faith to fiction, indian mythology is in fashion like never before. heroes are being re-imagined, heroines are driving epics on television and writers are reinterpreting mythical tales from the point of view of villains. in between news channels are busy discussing entry of women in a shani temple and science congress is debating the understanding of plastic surgery in pre-historic times., in such a scenario we catch up with utkarsh patel, corporate-professional-turned-mythologist. author of “shakuntala – the woman wronged”, utkarsh is professor of comparative mythology at the mumbai university and writes a popular blog this is utkarsh speaking. he was in the city to give a talk on “tracking the epics”., edited excerpts:, is mythology meant for rational man?, to me mythology is not religion. it was the primeval man’s answer to questions. sometimes we explain mythology as early man’s science. a way to understand why it is that sky becomes dark in the evening. what is a thunder…the fear of death made him invent yama. some say these are stories which lay down a social norm like when a woman is going through her monthly periods she should be secluded. they were giving us a social construct and each story has to be weighed in its own milieu., that mythology became religion is a different subject and it is true only for india. for the greeks, egyptians and chinese it didn’t. what happened was through mythical characters we defined our religion which is polytheistic and we continued with it. all the mythical characters started becoming god. the whole concept of hinduism per se if you look at it is very open. every other religion has a very clear code of conduct. there is only one book. till the british didn’t come probably we didn’t have the answer to which is our religious book. it’s only when the british landed and asked how will you take oath that we said “gita”. otherwise, why not the vedas, why not the puranas. the moment you turn mythology into religion it becomes a touch-me-not subject. to me the hero of ramayan is ram and not lord ram. he is a mythical figure for me., there has been a debate on the entry of women in sabarimala and shani shignapur temple. as a mythologist how do you see it?, to say shani reflects rays that are harmful to women are scare techniques. there is no logic to it. also, shani is married. so there is no reason a woman can’t enter into the sanctum but whether a woman needs to go inside is a different story. you seldom get to hear a woman saying mere par shani bhari hai. we must remember that shani is one god whom we worship to request don’t look at me. please stay away from me. however, nowhere it is said that a woman should not worship shani., as for sabrimala, as far as i know, ayyappan hated women because the woman he thought to be his mother all this while tried to get him killed by saying go bring a tigress’s milk. he brings it but starts hating women. the other story says clearly that when he kills a demon, a beautiful a girl comes out of the body. she says she was under a curse and now that he has resurrected her he should marry her. he said he is fine with the idea but will come and marry her the day when no new devotee comes to him. it is said nearby there is a shrine of this lady who is supposedly still waiting. women in the olden times didn’t visit the temple in the honour of this girl waiting. this story is seldom told. it is part of my job to bring out all the stories but if i have a vested interest i will not tell you this story., how do you see the resurgence of mythology as a literary genre?, mythology is considered cool now. earlier if you go to watch “bhakth prahalad” or “jai santoshi maa” friends would say what’s wrong with you but today we are teaching them in the class. for many years mythology was being written in hindi, bengali, marathi and other regional languages but now that it is being written in english. mythological writing has become much more accessible today. you no longer need to read it in a language that many don’t understand., how do you look for sources?, i look for threads. there are many threads in rig veda which become complete stories in puranas. when i wrote my novel on shakuntala, i read from the original source, that is, vyas’ mahabharat. after making the original as the base if you tweak something, you know what you are doing. you should know which translation to read. for mahabharat, i referred to the translation by k.m ganguly, where there is not a word of interpretation. i want to do my own interpretation., television channels are hiring mythologists like you for serials., it is pure entertainment. there is a kernel of a story and they stretch it to make an entertaining series. it is called mythological genre, yes, but to me it is not mythology. i can give him a story which he has not even dreamt of. but then if you turn a five page story into five episodes then i can’t do anything., mythology is becoming popular even in management schools., it is about going back to the roots. the nris are looking into it. they read mythology blogs and tell their children. now they use mythological tales in corporate presentation. we have been teaching our students all the western thoughts – western theories interpolated for indian people. leadership stories are being drawn from ramayan and mahabharat. they are full of ethico-moral case studies. you just need to do the interpretation., you have reinvented shakuntala. there is a trend to look at stories from the point of view of female characters and villains., everything is being reinvented now. many people thought shankuntala is kalidas’ creation. actually, shankuntala is a creation of vyas. i have created two characters but it follows the same linear flow as vyas did. i added characters because the original story is not big enough to create a novel. i have debated these characters from my perspective. amish and others are openly saying they are fictional writers. why are we bothering them with responsibility? you might want to go back to tulsidas version but what’s the harm in knowing other versions. i am not saying which one is good and which one is bad but let’s try to understand the richness of the text., as for the trend, a new genre has opened. how far will it sustain, we don’t know. a whole generation got carried away by harry potter. now not many are reading it., are women more interested in mythology?, i teach hero mythology at my department where majority of students are girls. even during my lectures outside 80 per cent of the crowd comprise women. may be they want to know why they have been wronged so much. i tell them mythology was written by men for men. they needed dhishoom dhishoom and only male heroes could do it!, at the same time many people don’t know that mahabharat and ramayan are not the only epics we have. there is a huge epic in south india around goddess kannagi and my next book is about her., what hooked you to it?",0.10674346641013306,back roots,"utkarsh patel &#124; photo credit :

2016-08-02,let’s attract the tourists better,"in the third week of november 2015, our daughter reshmy and grandson vihaan went on a short vacation to hong kong. my wife sudha and i had not planned any outing during the deepavali vacation., i had not visited lonavala, in maharashtra, and my ‘awareness’ about that place was limited to just chikkis (for which the place is famous) and its waterfalls. not being very comfortable with online booking practices, i went and booked a two-day stay at a hotel there, through the nearest travel agent in bhandup, mumbai. also reserved two seats in a bus leaving chembur at 9 a.m. on november 17., we reached the hotel by 11.30 a.m. with just 50-odd double rooms, the hotel had a majestic, palace-like look. they served only gujju/rajastani/chinese vegetarian food., the package for two persons for two nights, included all meals, and for rs. 10,500, at the present level of prices, it looked inexpensive., day one, in the afternoon we hired a car and went around. covered almost the entire lonavala and some parts of khandala. chikki shops were everywhere. waterfalls were conspicuous by their absence! they say you should visit during rains to enjoy the waterfalls. did they mean rainfalls?, about tourist spots. we skipped the karla caves and bhaja caves, as the driver of the car we hired told us, “aap log senior citizens hai. udhar chadhna mushkil hoga”(you people are elderly. can’t climb up the steps there). the mtdc boating club, another tourist spot, was closed. skipped wax muzeum, as we had seen enough of celebrities in wax formations, some deformed due to heat, in other places., we visited a couple of dams, a lake, a temple (narayani dham), a couple of ‘view points’, sunset point and reywood park. a word about reywood park. several trees, a children’s park and a pathway in a vast area make it a nice spot where one would love to spend some evening time. but, it was shabbily maintained (i should say, there was no maintenance), waiting for someone to buy the area at a throwaway price and convert into a ‘resort of sorts’., that reminds me our wayanad tour of 2013. that district had been converted into a nice ‘tourist village’ in kerala, by developing half a dozen spots including pookode lake, edakkal caves and kuruva dweep with international-standard cleanliness and facilities. when we visited singapore ten years earlier, i had wondered why india, which has several resource-rich geographical areas with tourist attractions much better compared to what singapore packaged and served us, was not taking advantage of the rich tourism resources. what we saw in wayanad convinced me that just one district collector with government support can do wonders in the tourism sector., in india, i have had a glance of most of the state capitals in southern, central and northern india. from the tourism angle, i have visited parts of kerala, tamil nadu, karnataka, maharashtra, gujarat and rajasthan. outside india we have visited dubai, thailand, malaysia, singapore and hong kong., i believe india has not exploited even 10 per cent of its potential in the tourism industry. i am not against the private sector or public-private sector partnership in any area. but in the indian context, the nation has to have a vision about the kind of infrastructure that it needs, priorities about geographical areas that could be made attractive tourism spots, and the extent of support the government can give through guidance and policy support. conscious government involvement is necessary to protect the interests of the local population and the environment., unfortunately, like posh multi-specialty hospitals in india which care more for the comforts of patient-attendants, tourism is being marketed in india as posh stay arrangements and guided visits to certain spots developed with the inflow of tourists in mind, some ‘heritage tourism’, and lately several good and bad practices in the name of ‘health tourism’. there is no holistic approach., here also kerala stands out as a model, that can be further improved. though blessed with a long sea coast, several rivers and waterfalls, backwaters, pleasant weather round the year and a number of spots where tourists from outside the country and many from the other states of india would like to spend their days, the infrastructure available to provide stay and travel arrangements is not very impressive. guidance from the government as to the standard facilities to be provided in different categories of stay arrangements is conspicuous by its absence at the ground level., experience abroad, when we go as tourists to other countries, joining conducted tours or reaching there on our own and availing the help of guides, chances are that we will be going to places that have been developed to attract tourists and may not see the places which the host country is not proud of. in india we give the choice to tourists and many of them land in places that are not very attractive or are not maintained with visitors in view., in countries such as thailand, malaysia, singapore and dubai, tourism is not about staying in big hotels or resorts and swimming or playing games. though the countries offer good hotel facilities for stay, they ensure that visitors move out and enjoy whatever natural and ‘created’ tourist attractions they can provide. in some of these countries, dead butterflies to tamed elephants and dolphins, all sorts of birds and wild animals, and traditional dances of the respective geographies and large aquariums attract tourists much more than the large shopping malls and long beaches, which continue to be the main attraction in some other countries., countries that are dependent on or are aware of the revenue prospects of tourism, market the tourist spots by providing necessary travel linkages, stay arrangements and above all keeping them neat and tidy with all basic facilities around. they provide advance information to the tourists about the options they have to select the kind of places they may like to visit., the indian media are not very generous in telling you about the history and heritage of neighbouring nations. china is painted in red and described as a ‘communist’ country. but those who have visited china or at least hong kong and places in the vicinity of hong kong will tell you the respect the local people there have for churches, temples (many of them buddhist) and heritage spots., kerala model, i am an old-timer. naveen tandon, who did a project on ‘developing a branding approach to overcome the negative image perception of chhattisgarh’ last year, as part of his post graduate programme at iim ahmedabad (2016 batch), is all praise for the kerala model of tourism development: “when it comes to branding for tourism in india, the runaway success is kerala and we could learn a few things from the kerala story to have an idea about how states have rebranded themselves to occupy enviable spots on the tourists’ map. kerala went from being a budget travel destination to being the biggest tourism brand in the country. branding has played an important role in this transformation with the tagline ‘gods own country’ and a strong campaign focussed on targeting the affluent. the building of the brand preceded the building of necessary infrastructure. the building of the brand created the necessary demand for good hotels and other facilities for the tourists and other players.”, within kerala, there is a need to formally promote ‘festival tourism’. the onam celebrations at the district and state levels, the thrissur pooram, the aattukaal pongala, sabarimala pilgrimage, theyyams in the malabar area and several other hindu/muslim/christian festivals are examples. if transport and stay arrangements improve, tourists will make it a point to link festivals in their travel plan., kerala has some artificial water parks. but we do not have a theme park of international standards. a couple of parks/entertainment areas will be useful additions.",0.1120385420906254,let ’ attract tourists better,"third week

2016-09-08,the equality of entry,"when b.r. ambedkar was asked why he was so passionate about the issue of temple entry for dalits, he replied: “the issue is not entry, but equality.” it did not matter to ambedkar that he, himself, was indifferent towards religion, or that temple entry was hardly the solution to dalit oppression. what did matter to him, however, was that one of the most powerful tools by which an unequal society expressed and reinforced its hierarchies — through the denial of equal access to religious and sacred spaces — had to be smashed., more than 80 years later, august 26, 2016, the >bombay high court agreed with ambedkar when it held that the exclusion of women from the inner sanctum of the haji ali dargah by the dargah trust violated not only their fundamental right to religious freedom but also their right to equality and non-discrimination under the indian constitution. and in holding that women were entitled to police protection, if needed, to exercise their right to equal access, the court placed the state firmly on the spot for effectively guaranteeing and enforcing the constitutional rights of individuals, even against their own communities., an issue framed in legal termsthe bombay high court’s judgment, authored by justice revati mohite dere, is not the last that we’ve heard of this matter. the dargah trust will certainly appeal (the high court stayed the operation of its judgment for six weeks to allow it to do just that), and the battle will move to the supreme court. there, it will join the other contentious issue of religious access, which is already before the apex court: the right of women to enter the sabarimala shrine in kerala. but whatever happens in the supreme court, justice dere’s judgment is a landmark ruling. this is not only because of its unambiguously progressive outcome, coming down firmly on the side of equal access for women but also because of its dexterous handling of the fraught and tense stand-off between the claims of individual rights and gender equality on the one hand and tradition and religious values on the other., indeed, the issue was framed before the bombay high court in precisely these terms. the bharatiya muslim mahila andolan, the women’s organisation that initiated the public interest litigation against the dargah trust, invoked the protection of articles 14 and 15 (rights to equality and non-discrimination), and 25(1) (right to religious freedom) of the constitution. the trust responded by invoking article 25(1) itself, arguing that islam mandated the exclusion of women from the inner sanctum. it also (though faintly) invoked article 26(b), that granted religious denominations the right to manage their own affairs in matters of religion., court intervention in religionthis clash — and the use of the courts to resolve it — is not new. the supreme court has previously ruled on the legality of religious excommunication, the exclusion of dalits from temples, and the hereditary caste-based succession of temple priests. to mediate the competing claims of individuals, communities and the state, very early on in its history, the supreme court invented something that it called the “essential religious practices test”. under this test, ostensibly religious practices could gain constitutional sanction only if — in the view of the court — they were “essential” or “integral” to the religion in question. in the beginning, the court emphasised that essential religious practices would have to be determined by taking an internal point of view, and looking to the tenets and the doctrines of the religion itself. in later years, however, the court began to take an increasingly interventionist stance, using the essential religious practices test to make wide-ranging — often untethered — claims about religions, and even trying to mould religions into more rationalistic and homogenous monoliths, while marginalising dissident traditions. the high watermark of this approach came in 2004, when the court held that the public performance of the tandava dance was no essential part of the religion of the ananda marga sect, even though it had been specifically set down as such in their holy book., a question of civil rightsfaced with more than five decades of consistent supreme court jurisprudence, the bombay high court had no feasible choice other than deploying the (unsatisfactory) essential religious practices test to determine the validity of the dargah trust’s arguments. the manner in which it did so, however, was careful and circumspect. the court refrained from making grand, rhetorical claims about islam and gender equality (even though it was invited to do so) and, instead, limited itself to considering the material placed before it by the dargah trust. on a perusal of these passages from the koran and the hadith, the court found that none of this material supported the trust’s claim that islam mandated the exclusion of women from the inner sanctum of shrines. the trust’s claims were thrown further into doubt because right until 2012, women’s entry had, in fact, been allowed. the trust was unable to show what had changed so suddenly in 2012, even though it did attempt to argue that it had been interpreting the requirements of the sharia wrongly for all these years., likewise, the court’s rejection of the trust’s article 26 claims was sober and measured. surveying the history of the dargah trust, it found that it had been set up in pre-independence days by a government-imposed scheme. that scheme did not even authorise the trust to adjudicate religious claims. furthermore, the trust was a public charitable trust. consequently, the dargah was akin to a public space, and access to it could not be denied on discriminatory grounds. interestingly, the court’s reasoning mirrored the earliest temple-entry movements in colonial india. while agitating for the rights of dalits to enter hindu temples, ambedkar repeatedly argued that temples were public spaces, akin to roads, schools, or water tanks. in a society where religion and the public sphere have always been so intertwined, ambedkar’s fundamental insight was that religious exclusion had a public character, and that it was not just an issue of sacral traditions but one of civil rights and material and symbolic equality. in a society that has long treated women as second-class citizens, and emphasised and concretised that inequality through control over religious spaces, ambedkar’s arguments find clear resonance in

2016-10-17,sc extends stay on bombay high court’s haji ali order,"the trust moved the apex court challenging the bombay high court order lifting the ban on women from entering the sanctum sanctorum , the supreme court on monday extended the stay granted by bombay high court to facilitate an appeal against its decision to lift the ban on entry of women near the sanctum sanctorum of the famous haji ali dargah till october 24, when it will hear the matter., as the case did not reach the board for hearing, the counsel for the haji ali dargah trust urged the bench comprising chief justice t.s. thakur, justice a.m. khanwilkar and d.y. chandrachud to extend the stay until the next date of the hearing., the bench accepted the oral plea of senior advocate gopal subramaniam in this regard., the apex court had on october 7 expressed hope that the trust, which has challenged the high court judgement, “will take a stand which is progressive.” mr. subramaniam had also assured the bench that he was on a “progressive mission” and said all holy books and scriptures promoted equality and nothing which is regressive in character should be suggested., the bench had also remarked that “if you are not allowing both men and women to go beyond a point, there is no problem. but if you are allowing some to go beyond a point while others are not, it is a problem.”, the bench, which recorded that an identical issue has been raised and was pending before the supreme court relating to the sabarimala temple in kerala, said “the problem is not only among muslims, but among the hindus also.”, the counsel, appearing for a women’s group which has challenged the practice of the trust not to allow women near the sanctum sanctorum, had submitted that the position was different before 2011 than what it is today., the trust moved the apex court challenging the bombay high court order lifting the ban on women from entering the sanctum sanctorum of the renowned muslim shrine in south bombay., the high court on august 26 had held that the ban imposed by the trust on women from entering the sanctum sanctorum of the haji ali dargah, contravened articles 14, 15 and 25 of the constitution and said women should be permitted to enter the sanctum sanctorum like men., the high court had allowed a pil filed by two women, zakia soman and noorjehan niaz, from ngo bharatiya muslim mahila andolan, challenging the ban on women’s entry into the sanctum sanctorum of the dargah from 2012., it had granted a six-week stay on the order on a request by the dargah trust to enable it to appeal before the supreme court., the high court had held that the trust had no power to alter or modify the mode or manner of religious practices of any individual or any group., the high court in its 56-page judgement had also noted that the “right to manage the trust cannot override the right to practice religion itself.”, it had said the trust has not been able to justify the ban legally or otherwise. hence it cannot be said that the prohibition was an essential and integral part of islam and whether taking away that part of the practice would result in a fundamental change in the character of the religion or belief., it had also refused to accept the trust’s justification that the ban was imposed for safety and security of women, in particular, to prevent sexual harassment at places of worship., the trust had claimed that the ban was in keeping with an order of the supreme court wherein stringent directions have been issued to ensure that there is no sexual harassment to women at

as a group we have gone on quite a few treks and i know several women who breeze through full marathons without any problem!” says the techie. , incensed by the attempt to “protect women” by putting in place more curbs on women, aleyamma and other women activists decided to bring the ‘i will go out’ movement to the city. “instead of installing more cctv cameras and stopping women from travelling, the authorities must ensure that public spaces are safe for women and not confine them to certain spaces in the name of protecting them. it is a farce. there should be gender sensitisation programmes for men,” adds aleyamma. , young filmmaker nayana sooriyan also emphatically says that it is high time the government came up with gender training programmes for men. “their attitudes must change. public spaces and roads are for all and women must be able to use them at any time without having to face discrimination or molestation of any kind. in kerala, one has to deal with unsavoury situations even in broad daylight. it could be in the form of unwanted remarks, intimidatory gaze or touch. the man and not the woman must face the ire of society when an incident like the one in bengaluru takes place. victim shaming has to be stop,” she says. , however sradha sreejaya voices a note of caution. having been a spectator to the horrific incidents in bengaluru, sradha says one of the ways to tackle such hooligans is to file complaints and firs against perpetrators. “the excuse was that there were no complaints for the police to act upon. we have to speak up. men and women must come forward in droves to file mass petitions and get the government to act. i don’t know if just a walk alone will help. many such protests have been held before and it has not made our streets safer. we need buses 24x7, well-lit roads, clean rest rooms and a change in the mindset of men to ensure that women can use public spaces without endangering themselves.”, college student and keen biker athira s.s. rues that one never knows from where and when the hits come, only they just keep coming. “i’m so used to verbal abuse whenever i ride my bike that i no longer hear it. the city is not all that safe for a woman biker. recently, at shanghumughom beach, late one evening, i came back to find that someone had deliberately let the air out of the tyres! then, another time, in palayam, i found that someone had scratched the visor of my helmet.” , problems there are, in plenty, but the women say in one voice that gender sensitisation programmes can bring about a change in attitudes of men. , since she is travelling to pondicherry, sradha plans to participate in the campaign there. “i feel safer in pondicherry. women travel in buses even at late in the night. here, the city shuts down by 8.30 p.m. unless that changes, our roads will continue to be unsafe for women,” she says. , many of the women insist that ‘pink taxis’ and ‘pink buses’ will only aggravate the problem by creating exclusive zones when the need of the day is inclusive spaces. “we need to co-exist and not be confined to exclusive zones,” avers sradha. , as celebrated author ayn rand once said, “the question isn’t who’s going to let me; it’s who’s going to stop me!” , the right to safety , the event coincides with the ‘women’s march on washington’ in the united states, and across the world, on the same day. , the first ‘i will go out’ protest was in bengaluru on january 11. now, women from more cities have joined hands to bolster the movement for the safety of women. , in thiruvananthapuram, women from all walks of life are meeting at palayam, at 5.30 p.m.",0.07373282828282827,women move,"woman cycling early hours day photo : k.r. deepak &#124; photo credit : k.r. deepak , , anger streets. simmering homes , campuses workplaces. two weeks bengaluru ’ night shame , women india getting together reclaim streets event ‘i go ’ , nationwide campaign protest shackles attitudes restrict woman ’ movements. , kerala , particularly , increasing incidences misogyny , debates around opening sabarimala women ages banning women taking part agasthyakoodam trek , latest issues causing quite uproar. , “every time , incident like mass molestation took place bengaluru , government reacts imposing restrictions movement women snide remarks people , obviously ’ know better , way women supposed dress , live work , ” says aleyamma vijayan , gender consultant founder sakhi resource centre women. , sajna ali , techie keen traveller , leads city-based , women-only travel group appooppanthaadi , scoffs ‘official ’ reasons banning women agasthyakoodam trek , currently way. “they say trek risky difficult women difficult provide facility protection women that. well ’ load tosh , ever one !

2017-01-23,between trains wrong and right ,"twelve years ago, before i bought my first mobile phone, i was in the railway station in thrissur, kerala, waiting for the overnight alappuzha (formerly alleppey) express to travel to chennai. the train was expected at 6.30 p.m. i congratulated myself on having arrived on time, and found a porter who did not either say something cheeky or suggest i jump down from platform 1 and clamber up on to platform 2 on the opposite side of the rails in order to avoid going up and down the staircase to achieve the right spot. i bought a bottle of water and arranged myself and my luggage to await the announcement of the position of my bogie, the second-class air-conditioned sleeper, in which i was booked. i still remember the berth number: a-34. , to my pleasant surprise, about ten minutes before the scheduled time, the train, heart ablaze, pounded into the station. i looked around desperately for my porter but there was no sight of him. with a deep sense of grievance i dragged my luggage to the compartment and boarded. , i usually make friends with my fellow-passengers as soon as i settle my luggage, but this time i stood at the door looking for my porter. though he hadn’t quite completed his assignment, i wanted to pay him. the train moved and i returned to my seat, feeling guilty. , my fellow-passengers comprised a gentleman in the aisle seat who avoided eye-contact, and a mother and her two grown-up sons on the berth opposite me who were reading the bible. i got no chance to start a friendly conversation till i reached palakkad. suddenly, and probably because it was the ‘meals’ station, the mood in the compartment lightened. , “i have to make a phone call,” i said to no one in particular, and stepped out. as i made enquiries to locate a phone booth on the platform, a masterful looking ticket collector boomed at me: “please get back in, madam; there isn’t time for you to make a call and return before the train leaves.”, i rushed back to my seat and my companions suddenly looked up with friendly faces. but my conversation died on my lips as the man in the aisle seat said: “so, going to delhi?” , i jumped out of my skin. “delhi? no! i’m going to chennai”... whereupon the gentleman laughed and said, “well, you’re on the wrong train, and it happens quite often because there are just ten minutes between this nizamuddin express and the alappuzha express. anyway, don’t worry. get down at the next stop and the alappuzha will follow this train. if someone hasn’t occupied your berth you can catch the right train and get a night’s rest!” , to my consternation, the ticket collector who had ordered me on to the train arrived, and i blurted out that i had a very special problem, having boarded the wrong train by mistake. he took an instant dislike to me and said: “you saw me on the platform and didn’t say a word.” the prayerful trio broke their silence and argued in my favour: “she didn’t know till a moment ago.” and the gent in the aisle seat said, “you know this happens frequently. let her sit here till tirupur and get off and catch the alappuzha. she is all alone.” , “nothing doing,” said the ticket collector, applying the rules sternly. he turned to me, fully enjoying his sense of power. “get down now, go and sit in the unreserved compartment till tirupur and wait for the alappuzha there.”, with the united efforts of my co-passengers i was taken down and put into the unreserved compartment, with numerous sympathetic murmurs and veiled abuses directed against the inflexible employee of the southern railway. (“is he human?” “this is what i don’t like. why can’t he …”, and so on.), for two hours i sat with the wind roaring in my face, pushed as i was against the window by two women who casually crowded on to and across me and conducted their conversation at top volume. some people returning from sabarimala broke into a bhajan, and children ran about screaming joyfully or after bringing up their tea-time snacks. quite different from the air-conditioned compartment i had been ejected from, but… still entertaining!",0.0658662518037518,trains wrong right,"twelve years ago , bought first mobile phone , railway station thrissur , kerala , waiting overnight alappuzha ( formerly alleppey ) express travel chennai. train expected 6.30 p.m. congratulated arrived time , found porter either say something cheeky suggest jump platform 1 clamber platform 2 opposite side rails order avoid going staircase achieve right spot. bought bottle water arranged luggage await announcement position bogie , second-class air-conditioned sleeper , booked. still remember berth number : a-34. , pleasant surprise , ten minutes scheduled time , train , heart ablaze , pounded station. looked around desperately porter sight him. deep sense grievance dragged luggage compartment boarded. , usually make friends fellow-passengers soon settle luggage , time stood door looking porter. though ’ quite completed assignment , wanted pay him. train moved returned seat , feeling guilty. , fellow-passengers comprised gentleman aisle seat avoided eye-contact , mother two grown-up sons berth opposite reading bible. got chance start friendly conversation till reached palakkad. suddenly , probably ‘meals ’ station , mood compartment lightened. , “i make phone call , ” said one particular , stepped out. made enquiries locate phone booth platform , masterful looking ticket collector boomed : “please get back , madam ; ’ time make call return train leaves. ” , rushed back seat companions suddenly looked friendly faces. conversation died lips man aisle seat said : “so , going delhi ? ” , jumped skin. “delhi ? ! ’ going chennai ” ... whereupon gentleman laughed said , “well , ’ wrong train , happens quite often ten minutes nizamuddin express alappuzha express. anyway , ’ worry. get next stop alappuzha follow train. someone ’ occupied berth catch right train get night ’ rest ! ” , consternation , ticket collector ordered train arrived , blurted special problem , boarded wrong train mistake. took instant dislike said : “you saw platform ’ say word. ” prayerful trio broke silence argued favour : “she ’ know till moment ago. ” gent aisle seat said , “you know happens frequently. let sit till tirupur get catch alappuzha. alone. ” , “nothing , ” said ticket collector , applying rules sternly. turned , fully enjoying sense power. “get , go sit unreserved compartment till tirupur wait alappuzha there. ” , united efforts co-passengers taken put unreserved compartment , numerous sympathetic murmurs veiled abuses directed inflexible employee southern railway.

2017-02-25,the man who nabbed veerappan,"the 65-year-old former stf chief does push-ups on the marina in chennai. | photo credit: dinesh krishnan , this is not in his book but veerappan, india’s most notorious bandit, had k. vijay kumar, india’s most famous bandit-catcher, who had been on his trail for most of his uniformed life, in his sights on three occasions. not more than 500 yards away. all veerappan had to do was squeeze the trigger, and with even a standard issue .303, which can take a target down at 500 metres, vijay kumar may not have got to write a book about how he killed the bandit., veerappan was a good marksman, vijay kumar says at the police club in egmore, chennai, where he is hours away from launching his book, veerappan, chasing the brigand. at the back of the police club, where he stays in room 108 every time he visits the city, stretches a lawn that now has shamianas erected to serve, as he puts it, “high tea” to the 300 people he expects in the evening. many of them will be gun-toting buddies from his veerappan days. the dais is green like the backdrop, which has hills painted over it; in the foreground are male mannequins wearing camouflage combat fatigues and pith hats with leaves sticking out of them., as he walks me through the programme for the evening, i can’t help mentally picturing one heavily moustachioed policeman chasing another excessively moustachioed brigand—is this quaintly archaic term the right word for someone who killed 124 people?—through 1,200 square kilometres of forests in three states over several years, each taking turns to scope the other through the business end of a gun. the forensic specialist told vijay kumar that veerappan at 52 had the body of a 25-year-old. at 65, the cop looks just as fit., ultimately, when vijay kumar closed the file on veerappan, he did so without exchanging a single word with the bandit who died under the impression that the policeman who kept chasing him was related to mgr., also readveerappan: the story of a finished life , veerappan: the story of a finished life, vijay kumar was lucky he lived to tell the tale, unlike some other policemen. he is not superstitious, just lucky. his lucky charm is about as big as an old 25 paisa coin, maybe a little bigger, with the image of the hindu god, ayyappa, whose temple he has been visiting from the time he was in college studying shakespeare, milton and thomas hardy. he pulls it out of his black wallet and shows it to me. he has carried this charm around for as long as he can remember. he got this particular one after he lost a similar one 10 years ago. there have been times when the wallet had no money, but the charm would always be comfortingly there., roughly how many times has he visited sabarimala, i ask. “more than 35 times,” he says unhesitatingly, “maybe 40”. sometimes he goes twice a year. and does he follow all the procedures? ayyappa demands a stringent pre-visit regimen. “yes,” says kumar. “so you didn’t have a drink to celebrate the night you finally killed veerappan?” “no,” he says, “i am fairly abstemious. i had a drink much later, maybe two months later. at that time, i was going to sabarimala.” i consider his response and say, “that certainly qualifies you for sainthood.” he laughs uproariously and shoots it down, “no, hardly!”, ultimately, when vijay kumar closed the file on veerappan on monday, october 18, 2004, at 11.10 pm, he did so without exchanging a single word with the bandit who died under the impression that the policeman who kept chasing him was related to mgr’s nephew, a rumour then floating around., by the count of ballistics experts, in the encounter that began at 10.50 pm and lasted some 20 minutes, 24 policemen fired 338 bullets on the vehicle that carried veerappan and three members of his gang after they had been lured into the kill area, out of the forest and on to the road at padi, 12 km from dharmapuri. only three bullets found the bandit. of the three, one went clean through the left eye. veerappan’s moustache, which spread like a tarantula sitting on his face, remained untouched., i ask vijay kumar why so few bullets found the mark. he says that veerappan might have been hit early on in the ambush and fallen down even as the other bullets slammed all around him. he should have been killed instantly but he wasn’t. veerappan was still dying when the policemen yanked open the vehicle door. it was the only face-to-face moment between the two foes. no words were exchanged. no words could be. veerappan was on the verge of death, his remaining eye already losing focus., was there anything he would have told veerappan had he had the opportunity? it is not exactly superstition, but as long as veerappan was his target vijay kumar had always kept a picture of the bandit at hand to remind him of his mission. he now tells me that he would have told veerappan that it would be a relief to finally throw away the picture; over the years, it had weighed heavier and heavier, like an albatross., what was easier, i ask. killing veerappan? or writing a book about it? “both were equally formidable missions,” vijay kumar says, laughing. in fact, the joke in his “immediate circle” of friends is that he took almost as long writing about veerappan as he took to hunt him down. vijay kumar had a version of the book ready two years after the mission, but it then became a protracted struggle. maybe, he told himself, he was too busy for the book. he says, “you know that wordsworthian quote? the one about the parent hen? i guess in my case the egg took too long.”, my wordsworth is rusty, but the picture is vivid. as vivid as the frustration that comes through in the book when the reward on veerappan’s head touches rs. 5 crore and yet no one comes forward with information. picture this:, police officer: you will get five crore if you can help us catch veerappan., villager: five crore? how much is that in goats?, police officer: if one goat costs rs. 2,500, that would be 20,000 goats., villager: what would i do with so many goats? they will be unmanageable. it’s better to hold on to my life., i ask vijay kumar if there is anything he put into the book but took out later because he thought better of it. he thinks, then tells me how one night after eating poha, his stomach started rumbling at one in the morning. when he could bear it no longer, he rushed over and shook his buddy awake and both set out. in the jungle, they always followed the buddy system: each had to look out for the other. the buddy kept watch while vijay kumar went to answer the call of nature. after he’d squatted, he realised that the spot he’d picked had elephant dung everywhere. it was too late to go elsewhere and he hoped it would be okay. but almost immediately he heard his buddy hissing insistently, “aiyaaa! aiyaa! yaanai! yaanai!” (sir, elephant!) he knew if it was a single elephant, he would be done for, but then, barely a few feet ahead, out of the inky black night, several elephant forms began to emerge like dark mountains on the move.",0.06432945526695526,man nabbed veerappan,"65-year-old former stf chief push-ups marina chennai. &#124; photo credit : dinesh krishnan , book veerappan , india ’ notorious bandit , k. vijay kumar , india ’ famous bandit-catcher , trail uniformed life , sights three occasions. 500 yards away. veerappan squeeze trigger , even standard issue .303 , take target 500 metres , vijay kumar may got write book killed bandit. , veerappan good marksman , vijay kumar says police club egmore , chennai , hours away launching book , veerappan , chasing brigand. back police club , stays room 108 every time visits city , stretches lawn shamianas erected serve , puts , “high tea ” 300 people expects evening. many gun-toting buddies veerappan days. dais green like backdrop , hills painted ; foreground male mannequins wearing camouflage combat fatigues pith hats leaves sticking them. , walks programme evening , ’ help mentally picturing one heavily moustachioed policeman chasing another excessively moustachioed brigand — quaintly archaic term right word someone killed 124 people?

2017-05-26,"1,400 years of wrong don’t make a right","as the triple talaq debate raged in court last week, justice kurian joseph asked senior advocate kapil sibal if the practice wasn’t theologically sinful. sibal’s response? “lots of sinful things are happening in society, protected by customs.” , in its turn, the all indian muslim personal law board (aimplb) had this to say: yes, indeed, triple talaq was immoral and a sin against god, but it’s been practised for 1,400 years, so it should go on. , notice that neither the aimlb nor mr sibal disagree that triple talaq is a sin or against the koran. but they still don’t want it abolished. and why not? because, hey, don’t you know there’s other bad stuff happening, so why bother about one more. and why stop something that’s been around 1,400 years. , i find these lines of argument fascinating. we heard it during the jallikattu protests, we heard it during the sabarimala issue, we hear it when a khap panchayat wants to lynch youngsters for daring to marry outside their caste, and we hear it when hypocrites point to hinduism’s flaws as a reason to accept islam’s. , words like justice, equal rights, dignity or humanity go conspicuously missing, replaced by “years of tradition”. , yes, religion is an emotional affair. yes, you can’t counter faith with logic. yes, nobody should insult religious customs. but as human beings evolve, one fondly imagines they try to become more sophisticated members of the animal kingdom, given they are the only ones with the powers of cognisance and articulation. that they aim for the noble work that tennyson speaks of — “not unbecoming men that strove with gods”., does this sound foolishly idealistic? well, it’s the same foolishness that urged raja ram mohan roy, vidyasagar and other early reformers to fight for widow remarriage, to abolish sati, child marriage and purdah. these were intrinsic to hinduism, but one realised they had to go if we were to be true to being humans first, hindus after. it’s hard to understand, therefore, why a muslim’s religious rights are to be placed above basic human rights. why should a barbaric custom, unheard of in other islamic nations, be allowed to survive in india? , there is an idea of utopia we look to, never to be achieved possibly, but whose contours at least must constantly be drawn and redrawn. and i strongly believe that all of us must be involved in that exercise, regardless of narrower identities of gender, race, religion, or personal stakes. , that’s why debates that trivialise the core issue are infuriating. mullahs argue that divorce in civil courts is a long-drawn, painful affair, so a brisk triple talaq is really a boon for women. that divorce rates are higher in hindu marriages, so that puts triple talaq above the pale of criticism. or, for instance, when pundits argue that women who demand entry into sabarimala are not religious and might never visit the temple, so it is not their fight at all. are we to conclude then that ram mohan roy was a widowed woman, married at age 12 in a purdah? is that what “legitimised” his fight? , kapil sibal said in court that triple talaq “may be sinful, but women accept it”. in response, the women in court chorused loudly, “no… no… no”.",0.045503875968992254,"1,400 years wrong ’ make right","triple talaq debate raged court last week , justice kurian joseph asked senior advocate kapil sibal practice ’ theologically sinful. sibal ’ response ?

2017-07-06,stamp of erudition ,"methil devika’s mohiniyattam performance in connection with the diamond jubilee celebrations of the kerala sangeetha nataka akademi | photo credit: k.k. najeeb , , the diamond jubilee celebrations of kerala sangeetha nataka akademi showcased several performances for 11 days in succession in thrissur. , two performances of koodiyattam was staged consecutively at the natyagriham of the akademi. kailasodharanam and parvathiviraham, a solo performance by sivan namboodiri, was an eloquent testimony of the actor’s histrionic dexterity. parvathiviraham is a continuation of the former in which ravana recalls the circumstances that led to the destruction of lanka by hanuman., ravana humbled , kalamandalam sivan namboothri in a scene from parvathiviraham | photo credit: c.b. pradeep kumar , the first one narrates the sequence of events that follow after ravana defeats vaisravana and takes possession of his pushpaka vimanam. as his return journey is obstructed by kailas, an arrogant ravana lifts the mountain and tosses it in the air. although an annoyed siva humbles ravana for disturbing the lord’s abode, ravana’s uprooting of the mountain resolves a tiff between siva and parvati when the two were locked in an argument over the presence of ganga tucked away in siva’s matted hair. pleased with his devotee, siva presents him with the sword chandrahasam. but, ravana scorns the couple who in turn curse him. the curse materialised in the form of hanuman’s vandalisation of lanka. , while the initial part of the presentation is totally narrative through gestural abhinaya, the second part is a vivid expression of sathwika abhinaya for which the face of the actor is fully utilised. the actor’s abhinaya vividly portrayed parvati’s responses to siva’s explanations about the presence of ganga. his transformation from siva to parvati highlighted pakarnattam in koodiyattam. a scene that shows parvathi trembling with fear is usually presented with the actor seated on a stool. the stool was missing in this recital and, perhaps, that was the only notable omission. , surpanakhangam, excerpted from acharyachoodamani, depicts the advances made by the demoness towards lord rama while he was in panchavadi with sita and lakshmana. disguised as lalitha, she tries to woo rama in vain. when she fails, she reveals her original form of the ogress and attempts to kill them. lakshmana mutilates her and drenched in blood, she leaves the scene. this portion is called ‘ninam’. the entry of surpanakha is noteworthy for the varied charis behind the curtain and her shrieks called heenaswara. kanakakumar came good in both. his ‘ninam’ evoked all the right reactions in the audience. krishnakumar’s rama, rasmi’s lalitha and manjunath’s lakshmana were commendable. percussion accompaniment for both the plays helped in creating the right mood for the plays., a scene of the ninam from surpanakhangam | photo credit: special arrangement , balanced delineation , methil devika’s thematic mohiniyattam recital was anchored on ‘oneness in dualism’. after the cholkettu in anandabhairavi, she elaborated the sloka from soundarya lahari, ‘siva skthya yukto bhavath saketh prabhantham’, which emphasies the essential oneness of siva and sakthi (devi). this she delineated through nritta and nrithya that were well balanced. arunachalakavi’s yaro ivar yaro in bhairavi was well choreographed. , charana shrunga rahitha nataraja stostram, the dance of siva to the stotra composed impromptu by patanjali in chidambara, was mostly nritta-oriented., harihara putram sastaram sada bhaje ham, a dikshitar composition in vasantha, is an invocation to sastha, the son of hari (vishnu) and hara (siva). devika interpreted the lines as a transition of the self to selflessness while a bhaktha climbs the 18 steps leading to the temple at sabarimala. although the relatively long piece was enriched with anecdotes, it failed to communicate fully., gate gate stotra, the last piece, from prajnaparamite scripture of mahayana buddhism, came about as a result of her interaction with buddhist monks during a tour of south east asia. , sreelakshmi govardhanan’s kuchipudi performance in connection with the diamond jubilee celebrations of the kerala sangeetha nataka akademi | photo credit: k.k. najeeb , known for her adherence to the traditional style of kuchipudi, sreelakshmi govardhanan presented a scintillating performance.",0.15453667953667952,stamp erudition,"methil devika ’ mohiniyattam performance connection diamond jubilee celebrations kerala sangeetha nataka akademi &#124;

2017-10-20,restrictions on women at sabarimala: it is complicated,"(a shorter version of this article appeared as part of a left-right-centre debate that can be read here), taking the sabarimala temple to court for restricting the entry of women of a certain age group is akin to meat-eaters suing vegetarian restaurants for discriminating against non-vegetarians by refusing to serve meat. common sense response would be to say—‘go find a non-veg restaurant, of which there are plenty’. tomorrow, self-styled, ill-informed reformers might demand that durga-kali worship be stopped because it legitimizes violence or declare the worship of shiv lingam as “obscene.” this is not farfetched because politically motivated groups have been decrying durga as a whore and krishna as womanizer. therefore, they declare these deities are not worthy of reverence., in any civilized society, gender equality is to be treated as one of the core values. however, with apologies to faiz ahmed faiz, aur bhi gham hein zamane mein gender equality ke siwa”. there are many more important values a democracy must uphold while standing up for gender equality—certainly not make a fetish of women’s rights., other core values of our democracy & india civilization are respect for diversity among the enormous range of communities co-habiting in india with substantial differences (as well as commonalities) in matters of faith, cultural practices, value systems, family structure, dress codes, food habits & ways of relating to the world as well as the divine. while the leftist-feminist reformers have no difficulty in respecting the rights of ‘religious minorities”—namely muslims and christians—to live by their own cherished cultural and faith traditions, when it comes to diverse hindu groups, they consider it their divine right to dictate terms., the unique grandeur of the hindu faith lies in the fact that each group, each sect and each individual is free to envisage the divine in whatever form, shape, and temperament that devotees like. that's how we have millions of devis and devatas with new ones taking avatar as and when the situation so demands or their devotees so desire. practically every village in india has its own gram devi or devata. our devis and devatas are not distant, unfathomable entities forever sitting in some distant god-land or heaven. they take avatar on earth to offer succour & comfort to those in need. in the process each one acquires distinct personality traits as well as preferences with regard to mode of worship., take the contrasting tastes of ma kali and vaishnodevi, both of whom are manifestations of the same shakti. while vaishnodevi demands strict vegetarianism, animals are routinely sacrificed as offerings to ma kali. lord ganesh likes modak as prasad while hanuman ji prefers boondi and lord shiva devotees offer milk and even bhang. devotees of various deities do not begrudge the practices of others. this freedom has kept alive vibrant diversity in our faith traditions because they allow individuals and groups to define their relationship to the divine according to their preferences., it is the same freedom which allowed manushi to invoke ten armed ma swachhnarayani, as our isht devi.she wields ten different non-traditional weapons that include a broom as symbol of cleansing society of corruption, weighing balance to symbolise social justice, a calculator that demands honest accounts of government, and a video camera that points to the need for an accurate grasp of ground realtity for those engaged in social reform. no hindu has ever questioned or protested against the powers we attribute to our isht devi or our mode of worship that includes jhadu puja., the hindu faith has thus remained amongst the most liberal in the world, with different groups and individuals exercising the right to relate to the divine in whatever way they wish, without insisting that others must follow their chosen path., even the most conservative among hindus don’t insist on uniformity of beliefs and practices. this spontaneous, mutual respect for differences in ways of being, ways of worship, singing, dancing, clothing, cooking and so on, is what enabled the rich diversity of india to survive through millennia. but in the name of equality rabid feminists can’t stomach such freedom and liberalism., traditional hindu temples are run by different sects with each choosing a particular deity in a particular form as their isht dev or devi. they’re not meant as tourist spots for all to come & go as they please. if you don’t respect the unique temperament of that deity or find beliefs of a particular sect offensive, you are free to opt for the devata or devi that suits your taste. there are lakhs of others to choose from., just as our colonial rulers with their faith in the superiority of their monotheistic faith, despised hindu religious practices, with their millions of gods and goddesses, our modern day missionaries can’t stand the temperamental nuances of our diverse deities. they have no problem in accepting that women are barred inside friaries meant to house catholic priests who have taken a vow of celibacy. but they can’t stomach the idea of a hindu deity who has vowed eternal celibacy which involves avoiding the company of young women. they take it upon themselves to cure this kink because their feminist indoctrination interprets it as misogny and gender discrimination! they choose to ignore that it is only one or two temples in all of india where women of certain age groups are denied entry whereas there are several ‘women-only’ temples where males are denied entry., as far as the issue of gender justice is concerned, the hindu faith can hardly be considered anti-women, considering it is the only faith that worships the feminine as shakti--the mighty force that moves the universe. male deities are powerless without feminine shakti from whom various devatas derive their strength., when i find the case against sabarimala frivolous, it is not to suggest that hindu faith traditions are writ in stone and unchanging. devotees reserve the right to change their dharmic practices as well as demand improved behavior by their chosen deities as per the requirements of changing times. that is how we have countless re-writings of ramayanas in different ages with each one interpreting ram in their own way and many even improving upon valmiki's depiction of ram’s conduct in various ways, especially his abandoning ma sita even after she had gone through an uncalled for agni pariksha or the deceit involved in the killing of baliraja. but it doesn’t behove non-believers or hostile attackers of hindu faith to impose their fads and sensibilities on groups who don’t share their worldview, especially if their practices don’t impact, leave alone harm the non-devotees. a genuine devotee has the right to demand change but not politically motivated hateful critics., ironically, the flag bearers of women’s equality don’t seem to have any problem with special compartments reserved for women in trains. most of them insist on our parliament enacting a law to reserve 33% constituencies for women whereby males are barred from contesting from those seats. they’re not satisfied with laws that promise equality. they insist on legislation that is unjustly loaded in favor of women. you can’t have it both ways – fetishize equality when it suits you and insist on special concessions and previliges as per your dictates.",0.1589676146638172,restrictions women sabarimala : complicated,"( shorter version article appeared part left-right-centre debate read ) , taking sabarimala temple court restricting entry

2017-11-19, the shapes of the worlds within,"last week, i visited my ancestral village and found myself listening to family stories told by my aunts who are well into their 70s. these were stories i had heard before. nevertheless, like always, they were repeated at family gatherings, attesting to the axiomatic truth of all collective storytelling since vyasa in the mahabharata: repetition endows potency. in my head, i often divide these family stories into two categories: stories of the times and stories of people. the former are tales of perilous years when hunger was common and scarcity the rule. these aren’t moral tales but merely their recounting — a survivor’s sigh of relief — of how far we have all come from the india of the 1950s to this day. the latter stories about people are invariably morality plays — tales filled with ethical breaches, betrayals, and comeuppance., this time, i heard a real-life story about a man who was a shrewd and feared feudal presence in their village — the kind who had managed to be both a functionary of the young communist party and also relentlessly acquire land and wealth. now in his 80s, after being felled by a stroke, he lay in coma, while, as my aunts described not without some schadenfreude, his children squabbled over his ill-gotten properties even as they refused to shoulder any responsibility towards his care. it all seemed a bit squalid, but none too uncommon, familial tragedy in play. what struck me vividly, however, was a statement by one of my more religious aunts: “it is inevitable given the bad karma he accrued by unconscionably fleecing illiterate mapillahs muslims of malabar off their lands.”, everyday secularism, irrespective of the truth of her statement about his purported actions, what struck me was the ease with which a religious hindu woman could imagine that a hindu man could “pay” for his actions towards muslims. the doctrine of karma, as she understood it, supplemented her intuitions about justice towards a fellow citizen, irrespective of her fellow citizen’s faith in the very same doctrine. it is this generosity of her theological interpretations, made on her own — without the sanction or permission of a clergy, without the approval from a book — that allowed her to be secular in practice without any supervised tutelage of the state regarding secularism. in many ways, she is not unique for a practising hindu across india. but hers is the kind of everyday secularism borne from the generosity of her religious piety that is often mistaken by hindutva ideologues for weakness and is often ignored by left liberals who have little use for religion, far less religiously inspired ethical commitments., the inner lives of devout hindus gains all the more salience this week as kerala begins to celebrate the next three months as a period earmarked for expressions of bhakti. public and private forms of religiosity will soon decorate the streets. millions of men from all of south india, dressed in black, heady with vows of brief asceticism, will trek to the temples at sabarimala. innumerable festivals at large and obscure temples, performances of various temple arts, concerts and processions, readings and discourses that run for days, if not weeks — it is all quite extraordinary. all of these are public reiterations of a way of living that has evolved over decades, if not centuries — a way of bookmarking human existence as seasons change and time flows.",0.06878881987577641,shapes worlds within,"last week , visited ancestral village found listening family stories told

2018-02-08, ‘i am for universal brotherhood’ ,"daivathinte pusthakam by k. p. ramanunni | photo credit: special arrangement , , one may not say controversy is his middle name, but it has been writer k.p. ramanunni’s constant companion. hear him for a while on culture, religion, sexuality and literature, and you can see a fiercely independent thinker under that calm exterior. shorn of that veneer of genteel calmness, in a free-wheeling interview, the author, whose seminal novel daivathinte pusthakam has won the kendra sahitya akademi award for 2017, spells out his views: , in baliyaani, men in flesh and blood, people who walk this earth, become characters in a story. was this brilliant move, perhaps a first, designed to grab the reader’s attention?, baliyaani is not a rejoinder, but a sequel, to the short story biriyani by santhosh echikkanam for which he was hauled over the coals. santhosh had scoffed at the profligacy and the extravagance of the affluent kalanthan haji in the midst of poverty, but a section of the readers mistook it for his derision for the community. in my story, i do not, for a moment, blame santhosh. i have delineated a contrite santhosh, feeling remorseful that his story caused discord between two communities. to place the story in the natural premises, it was necessary to pull in literary and other figures belonging to the area. , in stark contrast, in daivathinte pusthakam, we see mythological and historical figures as characters with nasa, the black hole, time machine and the like as adjuncts. comments?, it reflects my angst about the deterioration that is fast overtaking the world, humans and environment, the need to set in motion a corrective action. , a close look will reveal that all the characters are in a self-correcting mode. it is essentially self-criticism by mankind and articulates my wishful thinking that a new world order will emerge, with universality of love and the eternal truth prevailing. , no renovation is complete unless it starts from the past. and this is where the black hole and the time machine come in. this novel is set in a vast time-space continuum: dwaaparayuga to the sixth century to the current times, the small world that we live in to the galactic black hole., does one detect an autobiographical streak in jeevithathinte pusthakam?, well, yes and no. a writer draws copiously from the world around him, including himself. some of one’s experiences do sneak in when one writes, but so do those of others, but that is only half the story; imagination is the other half., milan kundera put it so succinctly when he said, “our dreams prove that to imagine – to dream about things that have not happened – is among mankind’s deepest needs.” it is those unrealised dreams that become characters, episodes and stories. amnesia is a metaphor in the novel – a ruse to get away from the modern, mechanised, loveless, artificial world. i go back to kundera again, “the struggle of man against power is the struggle of memory against forgetting.” , the common thread that runs through many of your works is concord and understanding among religions. nevertheless, does not performance of the rituals for a pilgrimage to sabarimala in a muslim household, though desirable, look contrived?, when i was in school, my classmate khayyoom spoke to me about muhammad nabi. i asked my mother who nabi was. her response was that he is the counterpart of sreekrishna. a woman who had not studied beyond class viii, she had imbibed that precept from her forbears and passed it on to the next generation. that spirit of inclusiveness sums up the essence of hinduism. it is not about religious tolerance, but about love for the ‘other’ religion. it is not for nothing that kerala is called god’s on country. far from being a tagline for the tourism industry, it is an uncontestable truism. in sacred kerala by dominique-sila khan, she refers to the culture of shared spaces between religions. , viewed in this context, there is nothing contrived in setting off for sabarimala from a muslim household or ashraf undertaking the pilgrimage to a place of hindu worship, observing rituals consistent with his faith and belief systems., towards the end of your debut novel sufi paranja katha, a chasm too wide to bridge develops between kaarthi and maamutty. does not this pessimistic note give lie to the hope for the hallowed tradition of religious harmony?, you can see that hope is embedded in the tragedy in the story. it highlights the fact that though the religions may be different, the culture is the same, as much as beevi and bhagavathi are. religion is not about rituals, it is about spirituality. maamutty builds a kaali temple for kaarthi and after embracing the sea, she returns to the beach as a beevi. eternal hope springs. , despite advocating tolerance and understanding, the past seems to repeat itself in the present. are not recent developments in the case of some books, authors and films not logical but unfortunate extensions of the same mindset?, hindu is not the opposite of muslim. religion is self-renewal. when sree narayana guru’s advice was sought on conversion from one religion to another, he brushed it aside, for, if you cannot be good, no religion is good enough. hinduism does not consider obeisance as the only form of worship. , the kauravas attained salvation because lord krishna was on their mind all the time, albeit as an enemy. take shankaracharya’s soundaryalahari or the kodungallooor bharani where it is the femininity and the sexuality that is worshipped. , despite being unbiased, even sympathetic to the minority and describing nabi as the embodiment of love, some people seem to have arraigned themselves against you. in a world where religion wields power and influence more than ever in the past, is obscurantism being bred and nurtured by fanatic religiosity?, there are no hindu fundamentalists or muslim fundamentalists; they are both criminals. it is not merely the fanatics that have turned against me; the secularists and the rationalists too have an issue. i am for universal brotherhood and plurality, not compartmentalisation or regimentalisation. , would it be right to conclude that in daivathinte pusthakam, you assert that religion is, to use a mathematical term, a ‘function’ of the economy, history, culture and geography in which it sprouts and lives?, it indeed is, as it moves out of its original location, it acquires the local flavour which is why the islam in indonesia or india is different from that in arabia. it is not anti-islamic. recall that imam malik adopted the african attire. vested interests pull religion back to its roots, thus preventing it from renewing itself while re-reading of the scriptures is the need of the hour. , m.t. vasudevan nair has observed that traditional notions about semantics are redefined in the style of writing you adopt. it is almost like unshackling the words and setting them free or assigning them new connotations, he says. how do you achieve that?, it just happens. the way you express your love is not premeditated: it is spontaneous, natural, evolving as the process progresses. you act as the situation demands. likewise, as one writes, words flow; they take on new connotations. at times, one invents new words or assigns new meanings., a charge often levelled against you is that your writings are suffused with large doses of sex, often not essential in or relevant to the narrative. your response?",0.07258256724548863,‘i universal brotherhood ’,"daivathinte pusthakam k. p. ramanunni &#124;

2018-07-26,the sabarimala singularity,"the supreme court is currently hearing oral arguments in indian young lawyers association v. state of kerala, in which rules that bar the entry of women aged between 10 and 50 years into the sabarimala temple in kerala have been called into question. at a purely unreflecting level the case might well appear to us to be an easy one to resolve. to prohibit women from entering a public space, from worshipping in a shrine of their choice, one would think, ought to be anathema to the tenets of a constitutional democracy. but, as a study of the rival contentions made before the five-judge bench that heard arguments shows us, the religious freedom clauses in the constitution are possessed of a special complexity, which the court’s own past jurisprudence has turned into a quagmire of contradictions., generally, the right to freedom of religion of both individuals and groups is recognised as an intrinsic facet of a liberal democracy. the constitution memorialises these guarantees in articles 25 and 26. the former recognises a right to freedom of conscience and a right to freely profess, practise, and propagate religion, subject to common community exceptions of public order, morality, and health, and also, crucially, to the guarantee of other fundamental rights. article 25(2)(b) creates a further exception to the right. it accords to the state a power to make legislation, in the interests of social welfare and reform, throwing open hindu religious institutions of public character to all classes and sections of hindus. article 26, on the other hand, which is also subject to limitations imposed on grounds of public order, morality, and health, accords to every religious denomination the right, among other things, to establish and maintain institutions for religious purposes and to manage their own affairs in matters of religion., until now, most cases involving a bar of entry into temples have involved a testing of laws made in furtherance of article 25(2)(b). for example, in sri venkataramana devaru v. state of mysore (1958), the supreme court examined the validity of the madras temple entry authorisation act of 1947, which was introduced with a view to removing “the disabilities imposed by custom or usage on certain classes of hindus against entry into a hindu temple.” the court upheld the law on the ground that statutes made under clause 2(b) to article 25 served as broad exceptions to the freedom of religion guaranteed by both articles 25 and 26., but here, in indian young lawyers association, the attack is to the converse; it is to rule 3(b) of the kerala hindu places of public worship (authorisation of entry) rules, 1965, which states, “women who are not by custom and usage allowed to enter a place of public worship shall not be entitled to enter or offer worship in any place of public worship.”, it is by placing reliance on these rules that the sabarimala temple prohibits women aged between 10 and 50 years from entering the shrine. it claims, through the travancore devaswom board, that its deity, lord ayyappa, is a “naisthik brahmachari,” and that allowing young women to enter the temple would affect the idol’s “celibacy” and “austerity”. at play, therefore, in the case is a clash between a series of apparently conflicting claims: among others involving the temple’s right to decide for itself how its religious affairs ought to be managed, the rights of a community of devotees who believe that a bar on women’s entry is an essential religious practice, and the rights of those women seeking to assert not only their freedom to unreservedly enter and pray at the shrine, but also their rights to be recognised as equals under the constitution., traditionally, to resolve tensions of this kind, the supreme court has relied on a very particular jurisprudence that it has carved for itself to determine what manners of rituals and beliefs deserve special constitutional protection. this doctrine requires the court to define what constitutes, in its own words, an “essential religious practice”. judging by its reaction to arguments made in indian young lawyers association, it appears that the bench sees this canon as integral to how the case ought to now be decided. indeed, the petitioners have argued that the ban enforced on menstruating women from entering the sabarimala shrine does not constitute a core foundation of the assumed religious denomination. on the other hand, the devaswom board contends that established customs deserve respect, that this particular lord ayyappa in sabarimala is a celibate, and that women of menstruating age are, therefore, forbidden from entering the temple.",0.09813622170179546,sabarimala singularity,"supreme court currently hearing oral arguments indian young lawyers association v. state kerala , rules bar entry women aged 10 50 years sabarimala temple kerala called question. purely unreflecting level case might well appear us easy one resolve. prohibit women entering public space , worshipping shrine choice , one would think , ought anathema tenets constitutional democracy. , study rival contentions made five-judge bench heard arguments shows us , religious freedom clauses constitution possessed special complexity , court ’ past jurisprudence turned quagmire contradictions. , generally , right freedom religion individuals groups recognised intrinsic facet liberal democracy. constitution memorialises guarantees articles 25 26. former recognises right freedom conscience right freely profess , practise , propagate religion , subject common community exceptions public order , morality , health , also , crucially , guarantee fundamental rights. article 25( 2 ) ( b ) creates exception right. accords state power make legislation , interests social welfare reform , throwing open hindu religious institutions public character classes sections hindus. article 26 , hand , also subject limitations imposed grounds public order , morality , health , accords every religious denomination right , among things , establish maintain institutions religious purposes manage affairs matters religion. , , cases involving bar entry temples involved testing laws made furtherance article 25( 2 ) ( b ) . example , sri venkataramana devaru v. state mysore ( 1958 ) , supreme court examined validity madras temple entry authorisation act 1947 , introduced view removing “the disabilities imposed custom usage certain classes hindus entry hindu temple. ” court upheld law ground statutes made clause 2( b ) article 25 served broad exceptions freedom religion guaranteed articles 25 26. , , indian young lawyers association , attack converse ;

2018-07-30, god cannot be privatised,"a recent observation by the chief justice of india (cji), dipak misra, while hearing the case relating to the ban on women aged 10 to 50 from entering the sabarimala temple in kerala, comes at an appropriate time, soon after the release of the contentious list of institutions of eminence by the government. interestingly, many issues relating to access to temples are also relevant to a debate on the excessive privatisation of education. it will be useful to understand the implications of the claim that temples cannot be private places., the cji observed that the temple draws funds from the consolidated fund, is a “public place of worship” and that there is “no concept of private mandirs”. justice d.y. chandrachud said that the “right to freely profess, practise and propagate religion” is a constitutional right. although the final judgment has not yet been delivered, these observations are extremely important for a public discourse on this contentious topic., in what sense is a temple not a private space? the argument that the temple takes public funds should be understood more broadly. there are many public institutions, including major scientific institutions and government buildings such as the legislatures, which subsist on public funds but do not allow everybody the right of entry into their premises. moreover, there are temples (and other religious places of worship) which do not take government money. can they claim that they are private?, i do not think so, for two reasons. one, they are allowed to collect money from the public; and two, more importantly, they collect money in the name of various gods. unlike a business transaction, which can be protected as private, this privilege cannot be extended to a place of worship primarily because the divine is not a commodity which can be transacted in any exclusive manner. any demand for the right to privacy in a place of worship will ultimately imply the privatisation of god., the observations above link the right to worship to the right to enter a physical space. why should this be the case for prayer but not for other public institutions? in the case of the sabarimala temple, it is not just the link between the right to pray and the right to enter the temple space because the restriction is only applicable to menstruating women. thus, the right is primarily the right of (possibly) menstruating women to enter the temple. this is not the same as the right to worship or even the right to enter a temple. it is more about not differentiating between menstruating and non-menstruating women in a public space and for a public activity., however, the interesting observation here is that temples are not private spaces. just this remark alone is not enough since there are many public spaces which have restrictions on who can enter. so, what really is the implication of the claim that a temple is not a private space?, this claim decouples the accepted norms of private land ownership from the use of that land. let’s suppose that an individual buys a plot of land as a private property and then builds a temple within that property which is open to the public. how do the private rights of that individual get erased the moment a temple is built there? what is the conflicting relationship between the presence of a temple and the doctrines of private ownership?, the clue to this conflict lies in a particular notion of god which is needed to understand the full implications of this relationship between god and privacy. this notion is that god is a public entity, the most public entity. god is the best example of the idea of ‘public’ since god is, by definition, accessible to all. praying to god does not require entry permits or a license from anybody. this is only because god is, in principle, available to all on equal terms. god may be ‘housed’ in a temple (or any other place of worship) but cannot be imprisoned and restricted to that private space alone. it is the omnipresence of, and egalitarian access to, god that this observation rests upon, even if it is not declared in such a manner., a temple or any place of worship cannot claim a right to the deity who is being worshipped in that place, since the deity by definition is present to all at all other places. god is not an entity who can be privatised and put under the control of certain individuals or communities or some dominant males. equivalently, god really has no privacy, nor can any human claim ‘copyright’ over their gods. even rituals cannot be privatised and copyrighted since they are also done for god, a public being. in the case of the god of sabarimala, he is worshipped in countless temples outside sabarimala where women of the proscribed age group can enter. he is also worshipped by women of this age in their houses. thus, all the arguments about celibacy invoked in this context are attempts to impose concepts of the private on a public being.",0.13640873015873015,god cannot privatised,"recent observation chief justice india ( cji ) , dipak misra , hearing case relating ban women aged 10 50 entering sabarimala temple kerala , comes appropriate time , soon release contentious list institutions eminence government. interestingly , many issues relating access temples also relevant debate excessive privatisation education. useful understand implications claim temples cannot private places. , cji observed temple draws funds consolidated fund , “public place worship ” “no concept private mandirs ” . justice d.y. chandrachud said “right freely profess , practise propagate religion ” constitutional right. although final judgment yet delivered , observations extremely important public discourse contentious topic. , sense temple private space ?

2018-07-31,the narrow and the transformative,"upon reopening in july after its annual summer break, the supreme court has immediately found itself back in the spotlight. if the first half of the year (occupied entirely by the aadhaar hearings) raised critical questions about the relationship between the individual and the state, then the second half — involving the (concluded) challenge to section 377 of the indian penal code, the (ongoing) sabarimala case, and the (scheduled) constitutional challenge to adultery — has placed the court at the heart of the culture wars. while the aadhaar challenge was argued on the relatively straightforward basis of when and to what extent the state can exercise its coercive power over individuals, the 377 and sabarimala hearings have seen clashes between the invocation of personal rights and the claims of cultural and religious groups. this is set to continue with the forthcoming adultery hearings, where the state’s objection to the decriminalisation of adultery is premised on the argument that it would destroy the institution of marriage., when a constitutional challenge pits individuals against the state, the court’s task is clear: if it finds that there has been a breach by the state, it must strike down the offending law (or rules), and vindicate the rights at issue. when, however, the court is called upon to settle a battle in the culture wars, the task is fraught with greater complexity. this is because these conflicts often represent deep, long-standing and irreconcilable divisions in society, touching issues of personal belief and conviction. constitutional documents often consciously refrain from directly addressing them: for example, the framers of the constitution deliberately placed the provision for a uniform civil code in the unenforceable “directive principles” chapter, thinking that it was too divisive to be made a fundamental right., this strategy of containment creates a situation where, for the most part, these conflicts remain submerged. the fear of permanent defeat prompts all parties to maintain a tense equilibrium. at times, however, the equilibrium is shattered when someone finally decides to break the stalemate, and raise the stakes towards a clear resolution. one method of resolution is through the courts. but ironically, it is the battles of the culture wars that are particularly ill-suited for resolution through the zero-sum game of courtroom litigation. unlike in political or economic disputes, a decisive loss in a matter involving personal belief risks creating deeply embittered and alienated communities, and risks an erosion of faith in the neutrality and impartiality of state institutions., for this reason, there is a popular school of thought that asks the court to tread with particular caution when questions of culture are at stake. as far as possible — or so this school of thought holds — the court should avoid hearing and deciding such questions altogether. however, if it must decide, then it should do so on the narrowest grounds possible. ideally, its reasoning should be limited to technical points of law, avoid constitutional questions, decide only the case before it, consciously eschew establishing precedent, and, above all, refrain from expressing any opinion on the validity of any personal belief or conviction. the role of the court, in short, is to do everything it can to lower the stakes, and take a pragmatic, problem-solving approach to the conflict rather than an ideal-oriented, expansive one., this narrow approach has been in play in both the cases that the court has heard so far, this july. in the section 377 hearings, the government stated that it would not oppose the “reading down” of section 377 as long as it was confined to same-sex relations between consenting adults in private. during oral arguments, every time the petitioners pressed for something more, government counsel urged the court to limit itself to simple decriminalisation, and nothing more. similarly, in the sabarimala hearings, what is at issue is the validity of a piece of subordinate legislation (specifically, a rule), on the basis of which women of a certain age are denied access to sabarimala. while arguments before the court have, of course, been pitched upon the touchstone of religious freedom and non-discrimination, it is equally open to the court (if it so desires) to simply hold that the rule exceeds the scope of the parent law, and is therefore invalid on purely statutory grounds. this would enable the court to avoid reaching any determination on whether sabarimala is entitled to invoke the authority of religion (in this case, lord ayyappa’s vow of celibacy) in order to deny girls/women between the ages of 10 and 50 the right to worship at the shrine. indeed, this is precisely what the narrow approach would advocate., there is, however, a rival philosophy of constitutional adjudication. this philosophy holds that the constitution is a transformative document, whose goal is to erase and remedy long-standing legacies of injustice. a particular feature of these injustices is their deep-rooted, social and institutional character. in the indian context, the most obvious example is that of caste. the pervasive and corrosive influence of caste-discrimination in our society not only prompted the inclusion of a specific article in the constitution abolishing untouchability (article 17), but over and above that, gave rise to a constitutional vision of equality that specifically included affirmative action.",0.09248787477954144,narrow transformative,"upon reopening july annual summer break , supreme court immediately found back spotlight. first half year ( occupied entirely aadhaar

2018-08-24,who wants white papers when videos will do?,"in a new video, former film and tv star pallavi joshi sips a cup of tea, looking resplendent in a magenta silk kurta, and proceeds to explain the rafale deal. she uses the analogy of a building society buying high-end door locks to clarify the fighter aircraft deal for all of us idiot citizens. this is indeed magnanimous of her, and one is grateful for the crumbs of wisdom she has thrown in the town square., only, who is pallavi joshi?, she is not a minister or civil servant or aide or defence expert or rafale representative. she is an actress. if the government needs to use sitcom actors rather than ministers,and fables rather than facts, to explain billion-dollar defence deals to voters, one wonders why., , this attempt to simplify everything to the point of infantilism is a peculiar disease of our times, and comes hand in hand with the deep suspicion of intellect and learning that we now see everywhere. where ‘books’ are a bad word, and ‘intellectuals’ the target of derision or, worse, gunshots. it is disguised as a revolt against obscure and sterile ivory-tower intellectualism, but is actually a rejection of reason in favour of emotion., the electronic age made acquiring and dispensing information really easy: books, reports, maps, data and facts are just a keyboard click away. knowledge has been democratised to an unprecedented degree; we no longer need teachers doling out arcane factoids to chosen ones., this democratisation is welcome, of course it is. who doesn’t want everyone to have information, literally, at their fingertips? what’s less welcome but inevitable is that, after a point, it is no longer democracy but mobocracy., data and facts, once so carefully mined, evaluated and presented by experts, can now come, unchecked, from anyone. and since mobocracy demands that the mob be placed above all else, there is simultaneously a debunking of traditional sources of information — institutions, scholars, journalists, media houses., so, if the message is simple enough and packaged in some sort of mock-serious fashion — such as this video — and comes not from any recognised source of authentic research or study, but purportedly from the ‘people’, then it automatically becomes the ‘truth’. as you can see from this response to joshi’s video:, “who’s worried... we public happy with explanation… according to me indian media is irrelevant… we are getting info faster honestly directly from govt…”, this is why mr modi doesn’t address press conferences. he tweets instead. and the mob imagines he is conveying the ‘truth’ directly to them. the mob, with its not-so-distant social memory of mai-baap rulers sequestered in palaces, feels privileged and empowered to be addressed so intimately by the ruling class. every person on twitter feels he or she has been singled out for a confidential sharing of top-secret info and laps it up eagerly and, more importantly, unquestioningly. that in-between filter — the scholar or data-cruncher or journalist — would have asked questions, the mob won’t. all it wants is a story. which the government is happy to provide. why bother with white papers when filmy videos will do?, the yen for simplification stems also from wanting to go back to a ‘perfect’ past, when men were strong and women stayed indoors and the young obeyed the old. dissent, feminism, rationalism, secularism — all these are seen as serpents in eden., science, once prized, is now regularly rejected in favour of puerile superstition. so, as the kerala flood raged, you have mr s gurumurthy, chartered accountant and part-time director of the rbi, commenting that it could be a fallout of the sabarimala controversy. this clearly amounts to spreading disinformation to create public panic, but it’s the sort of simplistic moral lesson that’s all the rage today.",0.12138830162085976,wants white papers videos ?,"new video , former film tv star pallavi joshi sips cup tea , looking resplendent magenta silk kurta , proceeds explain rafale deal. uses analogy building society buying high-end door locks clarify fighter aircraft deal us idiot citizens. indeed magnanimous , one grateful crumbs wisdom thrown town square. , , pallavi joshi?

2018-08-29,the final frontier of populism?,"if a baker refuses to make a wedding cake for a same sex couple citing his religious beliefs, is that an exercise of religious liberty or a case of discrimination against homosexuals? the colorado civil rights commission in the u.s. ruled it was a case of discrimination. the baker moved the u.s. supreme court where he also argued that his refusal also involved a question of the freedom of expression. creating a wedding cake was an artistic expression and he would not do that in support of a homosexual wedding., the u.s. supreme court reversed the colorado commission’s order, in june, on the narrow grounds that its procedures were tainted by an animus towards the baker’s faith. the court, however, did not rule on the questions of religious liberty, the freedom of expression and discrimination raised by the case — which are sure to come up in the future. the indian supreme court is seized of the conflict between a religious belief and charges of discrimination in a case on sabarimala, the kerala temple where women of a particular age are not allowed entry., when questions such as these come up in the context of executive or legislative action or inaction, it becomes the task of the judiciary to test them against the constitution. there is a long-running debate in the u.s. on how the judiciary should interpret the constitution. one school of thought, the originalists, believe that the constitutional text ought to be given the original meaning or intent that it would have at the time it was written. the evolutionists believe that the constitution is a living document and the meaning of its text changes over time, as social attitudes change, and that the judges should interpret it accordingly., u.s. president donald trump’s two picks for the supreme court (in less than two years in office) come from the originalist school. justice neil m. gorsuch and brett m. kavanaugh, mr. trump’s second nominee who awaits senate confirmation as supreme court justice, came through the ranks of the federalist society, founded in 1982, by american conservatives and libertarians to promote originalism. behind the smokescreen of his twitter outbursts, mr. trump is building a legacy that could outlast his presidency by decades, through appointments to the higher judiciary. unlike in the case of his foreign and trade policy, the entire spectrum of the american right wing, and the republican party, is solidly behind the president’s attempts to reshape the country’s judiciary. the trump administration supported the baker’s argument in the supreme court., also readdonald trump picks brett kavanaugh for supreme court , donald trump picks brett kavanaugh for supreme court , as of july, mr. trump has successfully appointed 43 judges, which includes mr. gorsuch, 22 appeals court judges and 20 district judges. barack obama and george w. bush had each appointed only nine appeals court judges at this point in their presidencies. dozens of more trump nominees are awaiting senate confirmation. mr. trump inherited a huge number of judicial vacancies from the obama presidency, as the republican-majority senate had slowed down appointments. it even refused to consider a supreme court nomination made by mr. obama, and the vacancy was filled only with mr. gorsuch’s appointment., mr. trump’s nominees are not only almost entirely originalists but they are also far less diverse than the cohort of judges appointed by mr. obama. only 10% of mr. trump’s appointees are racial or ethnic minorities; he has nominated one hispanic and one black so far. bringing in the highest share of non-whites in the judiciary in the history of the country, mr. obama had appointed 58 blacks, 31 hispanics and 18 asians over eight years. out of the 324 judges he appointed, 116 were minorities. according to a pew analysis in march, the proportion of female judges appointed by mr. trump was half as many as appointed by mr. obama. and 60% of all sitting federal judges in america are white men., judges are not impervious to public opinion but they are not meant to be its slaves either. they do not need to win popular votes this one layer of insulation from instant public opinion enables the judiciary to be the guardian of the fundamental values of the society, which too change but over a longer period of time. the tensions between the legislative or executive branches and the judiciary are unavoidable, and to some extent desirable, in a democracy. varying degrees of judicial review provide a way to negotiate a balance between public opinion and values in democratic societies. in india, the judiciary can review even constitutional amendments., when a society is in the midst of conflict over its elemental values, such tensions become more fraught. the legislative and executive branches are quicker in responding to people’s will and often, shaping it. when franklin d. roosevelt was legislating new deal measures in the 1930s, the american judiciary threw a spanner in the works. the president sought authority from the u.s. congress to appoint six new justices on the supreme court. the supreme court began to relent, and scaled back its resistance to the new deal, and a populist takeover of the judiciary was averted.",0.08458476389510874,final frontier populism ?,"baker refuses make wedding cake sex couple citing religious beliefs , exercise religious liberty case discrimination homosexuals ? colorado civil rights commission u.s. ruled case discrimination. baker moved u.s. supreme court also argued refusal also involved question freedom expression. creating wedding cake artistic expression would support homosexual wedding. , u.s. supreme court reversed colorado commission ’ order , june , narrow grounds procedures tainted animus towards baker ’ faith. court , however , rule questions religious liberty , freedom expression discrimination raised case — sure come future. indian supreme court seized conflict religious belief charges discrimination case sabarimala , kerala temple women particular age allowed entry. , questions come context executive legislative action inaction , becomes task judiciary test constitution. long-running debate u.s. judiciary interpret constitution. one school thought , originalists , believe constitutional text ought given original meaning intent would time written. evolutionists believe constitution living document meaning text changes time , social attitudes change , judges interpret accordingly. , u.s. president donald trump ’ two picks supreme court ( less two years office ) come originalist school. justice neil m. gorsuch brett m. kavanaugh , mr. trump ’ second nominee awaits senate confirmation supreme court justice , came ranks federalist society , founded 1982 , american conservatives libertarians promote originalism. behind smokescreen twitter outbursts , mr. trump building legacy could outlast presidency decades , appointments higher judiciary. unlike case foreign trade policy , entire spectrum american right wing , republican party , solidly behind president ’ attempts reshape country ’ judiciary. trump administration supported baker ’ argument supreme court. , also readdonald trump picks brett kavanaugh supreme court , donald trump picks brett kavanaugh supreme court , july , mr. trump successfully appointed 43 judges , includes mr. gorsuch , 22 appeals court judges 20 district judges. barack obama george w. bush appointed nine appeals court judges point presidencies. dozens trump nominees awaiting senate confirmation. mr. trump inherited huge number judicial vacancies obama presidency , republican-majority senate slowed appointments. even refused consider supreme court nomination made mr. obama , vacancy filled mr. gorsuch ’ appointment. , mr. trump ’ nominees almost entirely originalists also far less diverse cohort judges appointed mr. obama. 10 % mr. trump ’ appointees racial ethnic minorities ;

2018-09-08, caught in a flood,"every year, kerala looks forward to the southwest monsoon. it brings with it hope of relief from the relentless heat of summer, rain that moistens the earth readying it for cultivation and thus ensuring a good harvest and also replenishing the water table. however, this year, the monsoon was more than liberal. excessive rain caused flooding, untold misery and loss. almost all 14 districts of the state were placed on high alert. the state has had a similar experience nearly a century ago., for the first time in the history of kerala, 35 of the 42 dams in the state were opened. for the first time in 26 years, all five overflow gates of the idukki dam were opened., given the situation, let’s take a look at the state and its connection to water. first is its position, lying as it does between the lakshadweep sea and the western ghats. despite its narrow width, the state can be divided into high mountains, lowlands and the coastal plains. the last is covered by a network of canals, lakes, estuaries and rivers. the largest lake is vembanad, which lies between alappuzha and kochi. the state has 44 rivers, of which 41 originate in the western ghats. these comprise around eight per cent of india’s waterways. among the well-known ones are the periyar, the bharathapuzha, the pamba, and the chalakudy., the periyar, the longest, with a length of 244 km, the river originates in the mountains of the western ghats and is significant both in terms of economy and ecology. kerala gets a large part of its electrical power from the idukki dam on the river. the river flows through important commercial and industrial centres and provides water for irrigation and drinking. not to forget fishing., apart from this, the river is well-known for the 350 sq km stretch of rainforests. on the upper reaches, these forests cannot be reached easily and are among the least disturbed areas in the western ghats. the periyar tiger reserve in the south is known to be an ecologically diverse hotspot, both in terms of vegetation and animal life. it is also home to 323 species of birds, 38 species of fish and 44 species of reptiles. the periyar plateau, which is part of the project elephant reserve 10, has the most intact elephant range in south india and houses around 2,000 pachyderms. the thattekad bird sanctuary, though very small in area at just 25 sq km, is one of the most important bird habitats in the country., in the lower reaches, the river is heavily polluted by industrial wastes, and illegal sand mining is another issue that threatens the river. the control of the mullaperiyar dam is a point of dispute between kerala and tamil nadu. the periyar has five major tributaries and five minor ones., the bharathapuzha, also known as the nila, the river originates in the anamalai hills and flows across the districts of palakkad, thrissur and malappuram. with a length of 209 km, it has many tributaries and the largest watershed area. however, the river is not navigable for much of its course. eleven reservoirs have been constructed across the bharathapuzha and its tributaries for irrigation purposes. the bharathapuzha has featured in songs and stories and is linked to the state’s culture as well. cheruthuruthy, the home of kerala kalamandalam is on the banks of the river. famous poets and writers like kunchan nambiar, mt vasudevan nair, ov vijayan and m sukumaran have written about the bharathapuzha. however, unchecked sand mining and the uncaring attitude of the people saw it reach the point of no return. the river bed, denuded of sand, is full of bushes and shrubs, which impede the flow of water and may cause the river to change its course., the pamba, also known as the pampa, this river is famous for the sabarimala temple on its banks. it is also known as dakshina bhagirathi. it is believed that lord ayyappa was found as a child by pandalam raja on the banks of this river. its source is in the pulachimalai hill in the peermade plateau in idukki district. the river flows through a distance of 176 km in the pattanamthitta, alappuzha and kuttanad areas. in kuttanad, the river water facilitates paddy cultivation. again, this river is also being threatened by pollution and developmental activities in its environs. the pilgrims to sabarimala also tend to throw litter into the river., the

2018-09-08, caught in a flood,"every year, kerala looks forward to the southwest monsoon. it brings with it hope of relief from the relentless heat of summer, rain that moistens the earth readying it for cultivation and thus ensuring a good harvest and also replenishing the water table. however, this year, the monsoon was more than liberal. excessive rain caused flooding, untold misery and loss. almost all 14 districts of the state were placed on high alert. the state has had a similar experience nearly a century ago., for the first time in the history of kerala, 35 of the 42 dams in the state were opened. for the first time in 26 years, all five overflow gates of the idukki dam were opened., given the situation, let’s take a look at the state and its connection to water. first is its position, lying as it does between the lakshadweep sea and the western ghats. despite its narrow width, the state can be divided into high mountains, lowlands and the coastal plains. the last is covered by a network of canals, lakes, estuaries and rivers. the largest lake is vembanad, which lies between alappuzha and kochi. the state has 44 rivers, of which 41 originate in the western ghats. these comprise around eight per cent of india’s waterways. among the well-known ones are the periyar, the bharathapuzha, the pamba, and the chalakudy., the periyar, the longest, with a length of 244 km, the river originates in the mountains of the western ghats and is significant both in terms of economy and ecology. kerala gets a large part of its electrical power from the idukki dam on the river. the river flows through important commercial and industrial centres and provides water for irrigation and drinking. not to forget fishing., apart from this, the river is well-known for the 350 sq km stretch of rainforests. on the upper reaches, these forests cannot be reached easily and are among the least disturbed areas in the western ghats. the periyar tiger reserve in the south is known to be an ecologically diverse hotspot, both in terms of vegetation and animal life. it is also home to 323 species of birds, 38 species of fish and 44 species of reptiles. the periyar plateau, which is part of the project elephant reserve 10, has the most intact elephant range in south india and houses around 2,000 pachyderms. the thattekad bird sanctuary, though very small in area at just 25 sq km, is one of the most important bird habitats in the country., in the lower reaches, the river is heavily polluted by industrial wastes, and illegal sand mining is another issue that threatens the river. the control of the mullaperiyar dam is a point of dispute between kerala and tamil nadu. the periyar has five major tributaries and five minor ones., the bharathapuzha, also known as the nila, the river originates in the anamalai hills and flows across the districts of palakkad, thrissur and malappuram. with a length of 209 km, it has many tributaries and the largest watershed area. however, the river is not navigable for much of its course. eleven reservoirs have been constructed across the bharathapuzha and its tributaries for irrigation purposes. the bharathapuzha has featured in songs and stories and is linked to the state’s culture as well. cheruthuruthy, the home of kerala kalamandalam is on the banks of the river. famous poets and writers like kunchan nambiar, mt vasudevan nair, ov vijayan and m sukumaran have written about the bharathapuzha. however, unchecked sand mining and the uncaring attitude of the people saw it reach the point of no return. the river bed, denuded of sand, is full of bushes and shrubs, which impede the flow of water and may cause the river to change its course., the pamba, also known as the pampa, this river is famous for the sabarimala temple on its banks. it is also known as dakshina bhagirathi. it is believed that lord ayyappa was found as a child by pandalam raja on the banks of this river. its source is in the pulachimalai hill in the peermade plateau in idukki district. the river flows through a distance of 176 km in the pattanamthitta, alappuzha and kuttanad areas. in kuttanad, the river water facilitates paddy cultivation. again, this river is also being threatened by pollution and developmental activities in its environs. the pilgrims to sabarimala also tend to throw litter into the river., the

2018-10-01,an ongoing quest for equality,"on september 28, the supreme court delivered a 4:1 verdict, in indian young lawyers association v. state of kerala, throwing open the doors of the sabarimala temple to women of all ages. at stake were several thorny questions. how deep must the judiciary’s inquiry go in deciding whether to intervene in matters of religion? should the court disturb ethical choices made by a community of believers? how must the integrity behind these practices be judged? are religious exercises susceptible to conventional constitutional standards of justice and equality?, as the four opinions delivered by the court show us, these questions are open to diverse interpretations. while the majority agreed that women of all ages should be allowed to freely access the sabarimala temple, each of the court’s judgments, including justice indu malhotra’s dissenting opinion, speaks to a different, and constitutionally plausible, vision., how the court chooses to take forward the ideas professed here will prove hugely telling. will judges continue to don ecclesiastical robes in testing what manners of religious practices deserve constitutional protection? or will the court steer itself towards a more radical, yet constitutionally consistent, path, by predicating its analysis on equal concern, by breaking, as justice d.y. chandrachud wrote in his concurring opinion, the “shackles of social hierarchies”?, the respondents in indian young lawyers association, including a clutch of intervenors, justified the ban on entry of women chiefly at two levels. first, the temple, they argued, enjoyed denominational status under article 26 of the constitution, which allowed it to determine for itself the manner in which it managed its religious affairs. second, prohibiting women of menstruating age from entering sabarimala, they contended, is supported by the temple’s long-honoured custom: since lord ayyappan is a “naishtika brahmachari”, allowing women aged between 10 and 50 years to enter the temple, it was claimed, would affect the deity’s “celibacy”. what’s more, this custom, the travancore devaswom board, which administers the temple, further asserted, was supported by rule 3(b) of the kerala hindu places of public worship (authorisation of entry) rules, 1965, which states, “women who are not by custom and usage allowed to enter a place of public worship shall not be entitled to enter or offer worship in any place of public worship.”, the first of these arguments was rejected outright by the court’s majority. chief justice of india (cji) dipak misra, in his opinion written for himself and justice a.m. khanwilkar, found no doctrinal or factual support for the temple’s claim for denominational status. justices r.f. nariman and chandrachud concurred. the devotees of the sabarimala temple, they found, were in no way distinct from the larger community of hindu believers. consequently, the court also repudiated the validity of rule 3(b), which, it said, was, at its core, discriminatory towards women., justice malhotra dissented. since no person actually offended by the rule had approached the court, the public interest petitions, she ruled, were not maintainable. her concerns are undeniably valid and must animate future cases. here, however, given that the challenges to the practice had been entertained as far back as in 2006, and given that specific questions of far-reaching importance were posed to the constitution bench by reference, the majority quite correctly chose to deliver a verdict on merits. in any event, justice malhotra also ruled that the sabarimala temple constitutes a separate religious denomination, and, therefore, the temple’s administrators were at liberty to make customary exceptions in matters of religious practice. this freedom, in her opinion, extended power to the temple to proscribe women from entering its precincts., yet, much as the differing views between the majority and the dissenting opinions on the maintainability of the petitions and the denominational status of the temple are stark, the real nub of the controversy is elsewhere. it lies in justice malhotra’s withering and principled critique of the essential practices doctrine, through which the court has virtually assumed theological prerogative., ordinarily, in determining whether a purportedly religious command is constitutionally protected, the courts have sought to test whether such a belief is essential to that religion. here, for instance, cji misra found that the practice of excluding women aged between 10 and 50 years from the sabarimala temple is dispensable, in that the “nature” of the hindu religion would not be “fundamentally altered” by allowing women to enter the temple. although an examination of this kind is strongly backed by precedent, justice malhotra was especially critical of the approach. in her belief, the power of judicial review ought not to accord to courts the authority to judge the rationality of a matter of faith. “the issue of what constitutes an essential religious practice,” she wrote, “is for the religious community to decide.”, in this, the value in her opinion can scarcely be doubted. after all, the essential practices doctrine has allowed the supreme court to arrogate to itself the powers of a religious pontiff. but, equally, as justice malhotra notes, there may well be practices that are so pernicious and oppressive which might well demand the court’s interference. these, in her words, would include a “social evil, like sati”. ultimately, therefore, the dissenting opinion begs a question. it leaves us wondering how far the right to freedom of religion can really extend. and to what extent a group’s collective liberty can trump an individual’s equal right to freedom of religion. would, for example, denial to women of the right to serve as priests, or to be ordained as bishops, be considered oppressive?, here, justice chandrachud’s judgment offers an appealing way forward. the assumption by the court of a religious mantle, he admitted, has led to a muddling in the court’s jurisprudence, and, as a result, significant constitutional concerns have been skirted. what needs answering, in his belief, is whether the constitution “ascribes to religion and to religious denominations the authority to enforce practices which exclude a group of citizens”. the court, therefore, he has suggested, must look beyond the essential practices doctrine and examine claims by applying a principle of “anti-exclusion”. or, in other words, “where a religious practice causes the exclusion of individuals in a manner which impairs their dignity or hampers their access to basic goods, the freedom of religion must give way to the over-arching values of a liberal constitution.”",0.07486772486772486,ongoing quest equality,"september 28 , supreme court delivered 4 : 1 verdict , indian young lawyers

2018-10-01,"letters to the editor — october 1, 2018","the supreme court’s verdict in the sabarimala case is welcome. now the challenge and task before the kerala government lies in dealing with the logistics of managing an even larger crowd of pilgrims. perhaps the temple should be kept open all through the year. thought has to be given to transportation facilities, sanitation, food and drinking water. proper arrangements have also to be put in place to ensure foolproof safety and security of women., balachandran nair,, konni, kerala,, the verdict is a reminder of how valued cultural and religious symbols and institutions can have their narrative changed with just the stroke of the judiciary’s pen. i recall my father’s preparations for his pilgrimage to the temple when he was about 20 (he would have been 103 had he been alive). he went through the extreme rigours of staying away from his home, taking shelter in a shrine nearby, cooking his own meal using raw rice, and subsisting on just one meal a day for 41 days before starting out. this was just to avoid contact with women, who included his mother, grandmother and other senior female members, who in turn felt respected by such action rather than insulted as one would today assume. of course such rigour is no longer observed. but such practices and memories are what make the sabarimala experience unique. things will no longer be the same again., s. jagathsimhan nair,, thiruvanathapuram, the lone dissenting judge, justice indu malhotra, has rightly said that the court cannot impose its morality or rationality with respect to the form of worship of a deity. ancient traditions and practices differ from temple to temple in this vast land of unity amidst diversity. stream-rolling of diverse traditions and cultures is something courts would do well to avoid., kangayam r. narasimhan,, chennai, i wonder whether judicial thought went into the far-reaching implications of the verdict. it is fine to be talking about equality when it comes to worship, but the sabarimala temple has its own set of unique issues. it is essentially a temple that shares valuable space with one of india’s premier biosphere reserves. with the number of pilgrims expected to increase manifold now, and safe and secure facilities having to be created for women pilgrims, it stands to reason that this would mean carving out more land from the adjacent and shrinking periyar tiger reserve, which is already facing numerous pressures and unaddressed environmental concerns. no heed has been paid to detailed reports of the impact of plastic waste on wildlife and the release of untreated human waste in the forest areas and surrounding water bodies, especially during the pilgrimage season. given this unique problem, the top court should have taken its time before pronouncing its verdict. the ecosystem around sabarimala should not be given short shrift., kaveri medappa,, bengaluru, , it is most shocking that four years after swachh bharat, there are still sections of society which can get their next meal only if engaged in manual scavenging (page 1, ‘sunday special’ –“four years after swachh: cleaning excreta for roti”, september 30). it is clear that data on rural areas being open defecation free appear to be bogus and need to be revisited as one is sure to find many more santa devis across india. how many more dark, dehumanising days are there to be in their lives?

2018-10-01,one size does not fit all,"last week, we heard a slew of important supreme court judgments that have a profound impact on our lives. the available space within newspapers cannot do justice to the findings of the learned judges, especially in the verdicts where there were dissenting voices. and these dissenting voices do not fall into neat categories like liberal-progressive versus conservative-conformist., let’s look at four verdicts and the dissenting judgments. the court lifted the centuries-old prohibition on women aged 10 to 50 from entering the sabarimala temple in kerala. chief justice dipak misra and justices a.m. khanwilkar, rohinton nariman and d.y. chandrachud felt that the ban was a smear on the individual dignity of women. however, justice indu malhotra, in her dissenting opinion, said that notions of rationality cannot be invoked in matters of religion by courts., earlier, in a majority opinion, the supreme court upheld aadhaar as a reasonable restriction on individual privacy that fulfils the government’s “legitimate aim” to provide dignity to a large, marginalised population living in poverty. justice chandrachud, who wrote the lone dissenting opinion declaring aadhaar unconstitutional, held that the unique identity scheme reduces a person to a 12-digit number., and in the writ petition filed by historian romila thapar and four others alleging that the arrests of poet varavara rao, lawyer sudha bharadwaj and activists arun ferreira, vernon gonsalves and gautam navlakha were made under questionable circumstances, the apex court, in a majority opinion, held that the arrests did not amount to an attempt to silence dissent. however, in his dissenting opinion, justice chandrachud contended that dissent is a liberty that cannot be sacrificed at the altar of conjectures., the apex court could also not come to a unanimous conclusion on the question of whether the “mosque as a place of prayer is an essential part of islam” in the ramjanmabhoomi-babri masjid appeals. while two judges said that there is no need to refer this to a seven-judge bench, one judge felt otherwise. as the legal correspondent of this newspaper pointed out, justice s. abdul nazeer cautioned against hasty decision-making in the ayodhya issue. “here is a small piece of land where angels fear to tread,” he said, quoting justice s.u. khan’s observation in the allahabad high court judgment., newspapers have a design template where the various elements of a story (headline, blurb, etc.) are shaped as modules. the modules are rectangular and square blocks placed next to each other. this template helps to bring order to the page and allows related stories to be grouped into neat packages. design editors mix horizontal and vertical modules to break the monotony and create an asymmetry that captures attention. this template also provides readers certainty about what story to find on which page and how news is organised. within this template, editors try to provide two important elements that constitute public interest journalism: the credible-informational and the critical-investigative-adversarial., in his james cameron memorial lecture, n. ram, chairman of thg publishing private limited, pointed out that there are two valuable derivatives from these twin functions: the press is an agency for public education and a critical forum for analysis, disputation and comment. how do we efficiently and effectively marry the practice of having a working design template to the need to live up to the crucial requirements of journalism?

2018-10-12,the great indian abdication ,"unless… philosophers become kings in the cities… there can be no cessation of evils… for cities nor, i think, for the human race. — plato, the republic, after the slew of verdicts by the supreme court, on triple talaq, section 377, adultery, and the sabarimala temple, a prominent cartoonist adapted the famous “road to homo sapiens” picture to depict the supreme court justice as a barber who cleans up the barbarous neanderthal to make him a modern human., india, at present, is going through a deep crisis in which the mission of deepening democracy, and protecting and advancing social freedoms is placed solely upon the judiciary. on the one hand there is a complete abnegation of the role of the legislature, and on the other there is a dichotomy between social morality and judicial morality (itself an interpretation of constitutional morality)., both are dangerous tendencies., the supreme court verdicts have curiously become a spectator sport on primetime television with a great amount of anticipation about the judgments in pending cases. the same curiosity is missing about parliamentary bills/debates, which are absolutely vital to a parliamentary democracy., one example would suffice. earlier this year, the government amended the foreign contribution regulation act to retrospectively legalise political donations from foreign companies and individuals since 1976. this move — with potentially catastrophic ramifications for indian democracy — was pushed through without discussion in parliament and hardly any debate in the public sphere., if the judiciary has assumed the role of the single most important pillar of india’s parliamentary democracy, built on separation of powers, it is mainly because of the degradation and abuse of the roles of the legislature and the the executive., parliament, the supreme venue representing the people, has become a shadow of what it should be (even when the representation of marginalised communities has gone up). the words, “a fraud on the constitution, used by justice d.y. chandrachud’s words (in a recent judgment), have ironically been used before by the supreme court to refer to executive and legislative actions., the prime minister rarely attends parliamentary debates, affecting the sanctity of the forum. if the lok sabha met for an average of 127 days in the 1950s, in 2017 it met for a shocking 57. if 72 bills were passed in a year in the first lok sabha, the number was 40 in the 15th lok sabha (2009-14)., the budget session for this fiscal year saw a scarcely believable usage of 1% of its allotted time in the lok sabha, and the budget, the most vital cog of a national’s material basis, itself passed without discussion through the guillotine process. the basic minimum that could have been done amidst mounting allegations in the rafale fighter aircraft deal was to institute a probe by a joint parliamentary committee, but even that is not forthcoming. and what is the worth of parliament when its convening could be held to ransom to the campaigning by the ruling party in the 2017 gujarat elections?, parliament, instead of representing the highest democratic ethos, panders to electoral majorities, leaving it incapable of challenging barbaric social/religious practices enforced by dominant interests. that is why it took 70 years for section 377 to be partially struck down. is it then surprising that the supreme court steps into this dangerous void left by the executive and the legislature?, but the task of democratising society cannot be left to the judiciary, an unelected body, the higher echelons of which self-appoint their members through the collegium system (itself a result of the executive trying to muzzle the independence of judiciary). instead, it must be through social and political struggles from the bottom, and not through judicial diktats from above (even if the latter can be useful)., more importantly, the judiciary does not exist in a vacuum. even when it attempts to correct regressive social practices, it is still a reflection of our society. nothing could be more illustrative of this than the serious lack of diversity and representation, especially in the higher judiciary., in 1993, justice s.r. pandian estimated that less than 4% of judges in the higher judiciary were from dalit and tribal communities, and less than 3% were women. this led former president k.r. narayanan to recommend that candidates from marginalised communities be considered as supreme court judges. since independence, only four dalits have become supreme court judges, including one chief justice of india., even in the lower judiciary, the story is not starkly different. data from 11 states show that the representation of other backward classes, scheduled castes and scheduled tribes judges ranged from 12% to 14%. it took 42 years for a woman judge to be appointed to the supreme court, and there have been only eight women judges in the supreme court so far., while representation can become tokenistic and essentialist, democracy is absolutely hollow without it., the abdication of responsibility by the legislature is even more damaging considering that the judiciary is groaning under the weight of a mammoth 3.3 crore pending cases. the backlog of cases in the high courts and the supreme court is 43 lakh and 57,987, respectively., what could be more unjust in a democracy than thousands of innocent undertrials languishing in jails for a lifetime awaiting justice? a staggering 67% of india’s prison population awaits trial; 55% of these undertrials are dalits, tribals, and muslims., in this context, should the valuable time of the judiciary be spent in entertaining and delivering verdicts on public interest litigations (pils), seeking, to take a couple of instances, a ban on pornography or making the national anthem mandatory in cinema halls? the pil, a unique and powerful tool to seek justice for the weakest sections, has now degenerated. witness the recent example of one having been filed seeking segregated seats for vegetarian and non-vegetarian passengers in trains., overworked courts cannot become a one-stop solution for performing legislative/executive tasks such as banning fire crackers/loud speakers, enforcing seat belt/helmet wearing rules, or solving theological/civil society questions such as what the essence of hinduism is or whether a mosque is integral for namaz (going beyond whether religious practices violate constitutional norms).",0.08380861156723225,great indian abdication,"unless … philosophers become kings cities … cessation evils … cities , think , human race. — plato , republic , slew

2018-10-29,the paradox of faith ,"every day we see people brazenly driving through red lights, breaking queues with impunity or getting their way through bribes. each time i see this, i despair, but then these people invoke a particular reason to justify their actions. they say that they act in this manner because they have lost faith in the police, the government or just the people around them. they take the law into their own hands because they have lost faith in something or the other., there are many kinds of faith: faith in a person, a system, a government; faith in systems of thought like liberalism and secularism. having faith in a person often means that we believe that the person will live up to our expectations. similarly, when we have faith in a government, we believe that the government will live up to what we think it will do., faith is also related to promise. faith in a government could mean that we believe that the government will deliver on its promises. thus, faith is not just belief but a qualified belief related to expectations and fulfilling promises. even in these cases, it is not easy to ‘prove’ that the faith is justified. there are many who will continue to have faith in a government although the government may not have lived up to its promises., faith is sustained very often by hope. faith in a person is not about some belief about that person. it is the hope that this person will continue to behave in the expected manner. faith in its most profound sense is really about the future and is most often an expression of promise and hope., also readkeep the peace: on sabarimala , keep the peace: on sabarimala, the future is indeed a problem. it is radically unpredictable. that is, you cannot even attempt to find models of prediction of one’s life in the future. in the face of this unpredictability, our daily life is filled with moments of faith. for example, we have faith that nature is not unpredictable and that the solid ground will not turn into water at the next moment. we can act because we have faith in the constancy of the world around us. that is why when people we know well behave unpredictably it can be quite a shock to us., faith in the constancy of nature cannot be ‘proved’. having faith in nature is to have a belief that nature will live up to our expectations of it. faith is thus always more than mere believing. it is about expectations, promises, hope and the future. none of these can really be ‘proved’ in the usual meaning of the term since by definition they are all yet to happen., and then there is god. one could also have faith in god. what kind of a faith is this? at its core, there is not much difference between the meaning of faith mentioned above and the case of the divine. faith in god might mean any of the following: that god exists, that god will fulfil our expectations, that we can trust god to take care of us, and so on. since faith is one way we engage with the unknown future, it should not be a surprise to find that there is an intrinsic relation between god and time. these positions range from the idea that god is time to god conquers time. for many, faith in god is as much a way of discovering some hope about the future., but there is a difference between faith in god and faith in humans or social systems. this has to do with the autonomy of the individual. whatever our beliefs are, there is one central core to our behaviour. this is the assertion of our individuality, of not trusting anything or anyone completely. there is always a crack in our trust and faith., what distinguishes faith in god as against faith in everything else is the tension between human autonomy and complete faith. this is very well exemplified by life-changing religious experiences. almost without exception, all religious mystics have had moments when they have undergone a major crisis about their belief. this crisis is often manifested as a strong doubt in their belief in god. they struggle through this crisis and only when they come out of it do they really achieve true faith., all faith has some notion of trust and surrender but true faith in god has often been equated with complete surrender. in the tradition of ramanuja and bhakti saints, this is the true sense of saranagati: completely surrendering oneself to god. one of the most important consequences of this surrender is that the devotees cannot begin to think that their faith is more important than the divine. they can act as agents to protect human interests related to religious institutions but they manifest a crack in their faith when they begin to privilege their own autonomy. this is well illustrated in the apocryphal story about vivekananda. when he was upset at what he thought were attempts to destroy temples, goddess kali is reputed to have asked him whether he was protecting her or she was protecting him. in the name of faith if we think we become protectors of gods, then we have lost true faith. when we act in this manner, we are only showing that we are not capable of true surrender and trust that are needed of the faith in the divine.",0.12170897284533645,paradox faith,"every day see people brazenly driving red lights , breaking queues impunity getting way bribes. time see , despair , people invoke particular reason justify actions. say act manner lost faith police , government people around them. take law hands lost faith something other. , many kinds faith : faith person , system , government ; faith systems thought like liberalism secularism. faith person often means believe person live expectations. similarly , faith government , believe government live think do. , faith also related promise. faith government could mean believe government deliver promises. thus , faith belief qualified belief related expectations fulfilling promises. even cases , easy ‘prove ’ faith justified. many continue faith government although government may lived promises. , faith sustained often hope. faith person belief person. hope person continue behave expected manner. faith profound sense really future often expression promise hope. , also readkeep peace : sabarimala , keep peace : sabarimala , future indeed problem. radically unpredictable. , cannot even attempt find models prediction one ’ life future. face unpredictability , daily life filled moments faith. example , faith nature unpredictable solid ground turn water next moment. act faith constancy world around us. people know well behave unpredictably quite shock us. , faith constancy nature cannot ‘proved ’ . faith nature belief nature live expectations it. faith thus always mere believing. expectations , promises , hope future. none really ‘proved ’ usual meaning term since definition yet happen. , god. one could also faith god. kind faith ?

2018-11-05,failing to lead by example: on kerala and the sabarimala tension,"politics alone cannot explain the aftermath of the supreme court’s verdict in the sabarimala case. this is because for the rest of india, kerala has served as a model of progress guided by a long-sustained pursuit of welfare policies, especially in health and education. kerala also has a history of social movements that mobilised people to let go of the grip of custom and ritual. some of these movements were aimed specifically at propagating reason and knowledge. if the regime of modernity got a fair test anywhere in south asia, surely it was in kerala., these common impressions are hard to reconcile with the discomfort and palpable tension that the sabarimala verdict has caused. conflict and the threat of violence can, and perhaps, should be attributed to political rivalry and administrative ineptitude. but there seems to be a wider unease with the verdict., in a phone-in programme of the hindi service of the bbc, a senior woman journalist, who knows kerala socially, said that the verdict is ahead of the times, that it will take one or two more generations for people to accept the entry of women of all ages in the sabarimala temple. that sober prognosis left me wondering about the value and meaning of kerala’s achievement in public literacy and children’s education. was it wrong to imagine that the spread of education would cause a deep enough dent in all forms of gender inequality? persistence of dowry certainly suggests that. so does the acceptance of misogynist humour i have myself witnessed in the middle of serious discussion., apart from its failure to dilute a patriarchal ethos, education has also performed rather poorly in widening the space available for dialogue between contending positions. this is one reason why both the state and society are finding it difficult to appreciate a civic solution to a faith-related practice., education tends to arouse many expectations, both in the individual and the social mind. first, there are economic expectations. they are so strong that the educated do not mind enduring long stretches of unemployment. equally complex is the political expectation association with education. it is widely believed that education nourishes democratic values and behaviours. but historical evidence suggests that education can nurture democracy as well as dictatorship. it depends on what is taught and how. if schools and colleges are intellectually exciting places, and if the curriculum encourages critical inquiry, we can expect education to strengthen democracy. if schooling stifles curiosity by regimenting the body and the mind at an early age, education can nourish authoritarianism., similarly, if language and literature are taught to train young minds for participation in open-ended dialogue, we can expect education to sustain an ethos where freedom to differ without fear is guaranteed and dissent is tolerated. the opposite may happen if language and literature are marginalised in the curriculum or subjected to mechanical testing and other means of oppression. similar things can be said about the teaching of the subjects that constitute the social sciences. they can either be used for indoctrination or to encourage reflection., the question why education has not improved kerala’s capacity to sustain a culture of dialogue is not difficult to answer. education did spread widely, but efforts to reform its inner world — curriculum and pedagogy — remained weak and somewhat confused. significant initiatives were taken more than once, but the financial and intellectual resources deployed for this task were inadequate. also, the effort remained subject to regime change. in teacher training, one had expected that kerala would make a breakthrough by investing significant academic resources in this unfortunate area. that did not happen. bridges between universities and schools remained half-built. as in other states, progress of education in kerala remained confined mainly to expansion of the system. that too did not proceed coherently. social and economic divisions got entrenched within the system of education. successive governments remained indifferent to this trend and to the need to create a provincial policy., hailed as a model, kerala has disappointed. apart from failing to create an ethos where dialogue and deliberation are conveniently possible, kerala’s progress on the gender front has also remained unimpressive. the grip of early socialisation into deep-set notions of womanhood has stayed tight. one consequence of this grip is the perpetuation of deeply negative beliefs about the physical aspect of maturation. at this level, gender disparity deserves to be understood as a far more complex cultural phenomenon than merely a matter of unequal opportunities. education can influence gender roles and their relations by creating new predispositions in early childhood. this is a tough area for reform. it has remained on the margins of education, both in terms of funding and status as a policy sector. few would admit that they do not fully understand it or its significance.",0.000863926837952805,failing lead example : kerala sabarimala tension,"politics alone cannot explain aftermath supreme court ’ verdict sabarimala case. rest india , kerala served model progress guided long-sustained pursuit welfare policies , especially health education. kerala also history social movements mobilised people let go grip custom ritual. movements aimed specifically propagating reason knowledge. regime modernity got fair test anywhere south asia , surely kerala. , common impressions hard reconcile discomfort palpable tension sabarimala verdict caused. conflict threat violence , perhaps , attributed political rivalry administrative ineptitude. seems wider unease verdict. , phone-in programme hindi service bbc , senior woman journalist , knows kerala socially , said verdict ahead times , take one two generations people accept entry women ages sabarimala temple. sober prognosis left wondering value meaning kerala ’ achievement public literacy children ’ education. wrong imagine spread education would cause deep enough dent forms gender inequality ?
