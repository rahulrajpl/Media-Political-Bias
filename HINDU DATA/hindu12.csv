2013-05-22,an india story gone wrong,"much to hide: for both the upa and the congress, the picture is not pretty. , in 2004, the congress gave its decades-old slogan “congress ka haath, garib ke saath” a new look: it replaced the word garib (poor) with aam aadmi (common man) in the hope, a party spin doctor told this writer, of enlarging the party’s catchment area in the upcoming general election to include the middle class, especially those who, thanks to liberalisation, were just entering its ranks., it was a gamble after eight years in the political wilderness. but the slogan proved to be a perfect fit for congress president sonia gandhi’s barnstorming tour of the country that brought the party to power at the head of a united progressive alliance (upa) coalition that year. the aam aadmi tag caught on, entering everyday public discourse. the spotlight shifted from the bharatiya janata party-led national democratic alliance’s “india shining” to bharat nirman, completing the work in progress that is india by giving the aam aadmi the opportunities to participate in nation-building. the message was: it was to be a shared enterprise, with equity and inclusiveness as its hallmarks., five years later, in 2009, the party didn’t just win a renewed mandate, it won an additional 60-odd seats. the farm loan waiver and the mahatma gandhi national rural employment guarantee scheme made waves in rural india; prime minister manmohan singh’s efficient stewardship of the economy at the start of the global recession won him admirers across urban india, and he became the new middle class god., today, as the upa celebrates its ninth anniversary, that dream has soured. an unending slew of scams, rising prices and social protests against issues ranging from corruption to crimes against women, has seen the middle class turning its back on dr. singh and the congress. television discussions are dominated by tales of an incompetent, corrupt government at war with a panic-stricken party awaiting disaster at the polls next year., indeed, the congress was given just a couple of days to savour its hard-won victory in the karnataka elections before a vocal section of the media trained its guns on the prime minister, suggesting it was a matter of days before he would be replaced by a worthier successor who, presumably, can take on the middle class’s new hero, corporate india’s nominee, narendra modi., the aam aadmi, meanwhile, has been claimed by arvind kejriwal and his friends who have floated the aam aadmi party., for the congress, the picture is not pretty., dr. singh has not just had to deal with the bjp that, robbed of its middle class constituency in 2009, has seized every opportunity to pin his government down, and strip him of his teflon coating. the opposition has barely allowed parliament to function in upa two, thus blocking the government’s efforts to give itself talking points for 2014 in the shape of the food security and land acquisition bills., but the prime minister has not just had to contend with the opposition. within his own party, there have always been two parallel strands of opposition to him — one from congressmen who feel that indian foreign policy is cast in stone, and the other from those disturbed at the sight of a confident, assertive dr. singh driving the national agenda, the man who successfully piloted the india-u.s. nuclear deal, and then led the party to victory in 2009. in many cases, the two coalesced. “crudely put,” a party general secretary had explained, “the congress can be divided into the pro-u.s. lobby and the pro-nam lobby, those who are not shackled by the shibboleths of the past, and those who feel the status quo is the safest.”, indeed, the differences in the congress are not between the two “power centres,” dr. singh and ms gandhi, but between the prime minister and those who now see him as a vote-loser. anyone who has any understanding of the congress system knows that dr. singh would not last a minute without the full support of ms gandhi and now her son, party vice-president rahul gandhi. indeed, the fact that the upa has given stable — if not always ideal — governance to the country for nine years is in large measure due to the unique partnership the two congress leaders have shared., but is then dr. singh entirely blameless for the state of affairs today?, no one in the party still questions his personal probity, phenomenal memory, intellect or scholarship, but those who have worked with him closely say that he is a poor manager, a tardy decision-maker, and finds it hard to bring the passion he brought to the india-u.s. nuclear deal to all that he does. the manner in which he dealt with the financial scandals during his tenure leave a great deal to be desired: if in the early days of upa one, he had tried to work closely with the party — not just ms gandhi — by asking general secretaries to accompany him on trips within the country to increase synergy with the government, he was discouraged to continue the practice. in upa two, as the disapproval of his own party colleagues began to show, a cabinet minister said, he left it increasingly to pranab mukherjee — now president — to lead at cabinet meetings. if in upa one, he looked to allies such as the nationalist congress party and rashtriya janata dal to “balance”

2018-04-25,the karnataka election is our gateway to the south: amit shah,"bjp national president amit shah. | photo credit: pti , , i believe that there are three issues which are important in karnataka. one is the development yatra under (prime minister) narendra modi, on which karnataka has fallen behind. the bharatiya janata party (bjp) wants to take karnataka along as well. second, after 1967, caste, dynasty and appeasement have affected the electoral politics of this country, and we want to change this to a politics of performance. this means development, and he who prioritises that should be given the opportunity to govern. we want to take politics to that level. third, from the point of view of the bjp, we are looking at this election as a ‘gateway to the south’., there is a difference between the two things. if a candidate, at the mla or chief ministerial level, gets an advantage of belonging to a particular caste while fighting polls, that is one thing. but after having been elected, if you only look after the developmental needs of a particular caste or community, that is a different matter altogether. the bjp has never done that., for example, it is said that if mulayam singh (yadav) comes to power, he will only look after the yadavs, and if behenji (bahujan samaj party chief mayawati) comes, she will look after only the jatavs. but that is not said about the bjp. we believe in development for all, of those who have voted for us and those who haven’t. we also want to bring this credo to karnataka., this always happens with us. in tripura, uttarakhand, manipur and even gujarat, we are first shown to be behind in the opinion polls, or that the poll is going to be a hung verdict, then we are shown to be improving. and exit polls end up showing us heading to a big majority. thus i consider this a good portent for us if the first few opinion polls show a hung verdict (smiles)., the bjp has broken many such electoral myths. and i’m happy to say that we will break this particular myth as well., we are also not against the promotion of regional languages. there are many resolutions passed by the bjp in its executives and councils where we have strongly supported the promotion of regional languages. in fact, we have more staunch views on promoting regional languages than the congress ever did. as far as invoking king pulakeshin and harshvardhan to remind kannadigas of regional pride, what about invoking the power struggle between the wadiyars and hyder ali? why is the congress giving so much importance to tipu sultan then?, the opposition is expected to do this. do you think they will praise us?, we have come out with an ordinance. this is not politicisation of the issue, but to say that we are a government that has taken strong steps in this direction. bringing such an ordinance to further plug loopholes in these laws is the duty of the government, which we are speaking about in our advertisements., if you had observed during atalji’s (former prime minister atal bihari vajpayee’s) time and in the time of upa as well, when there are alliances, there were always differences of opinion too. we had alliances and differences with mamata banerjee and j. jayalalithaa, even with the shiv sena in nda there were differences. differences were there between allies in the upa too, and so too with our government now. in fact, we will go into the 2019 polls with more allies than we had in 2014. we have allies in tripura, assam. in u.p. we have two allies, three parties in maharashtra are with us, nitish kumar has joined us in bihar. our alliance will be larger than it was in the last polls., there are 219 lok sabha seats which we haven’t won and we can win in 2019. in the northeast itself there are 18 seats we can win. there is odisha, west bengal where we are the number two party now and were at number three in 2014. in telangana too there are seats we can win. we have been working on expansion, which is why you see so many bjp-ruled states. we will win 2019 with more seats, not just a repeat of 2014., this is an election for effecting a change. except for one district, i have visited every district in the state, met my party workers and the people at large. everybody knows this is an election that will bring a change in government, and that the janata dal (s) is not the party to bring about that change. the situation of needing an alliance does not arise. we are winning karnataka with a comfortable margin., i don’t take rahul gandhi very seriously, why are you?

2018-05-09,this is a battle of ideas and we are fighting ideology of hatred and anger: rahul gandhi,"congress president rahul gandhi has said religion is central to india and “as a political leader”, he will visit any centre of belief as long they don’t divide communities., in an exclusive interview with the hindu, mr. gandhi denied that his frequent visits to temples and mutts in karnataka were an attempt at image correction. “no, there is no image correction. but whenever i enter a temple, it deeply disturbs the bjp because they seem to think they own them temples,” he said., “in your question, you didn’t say that i also visit churches, mosques and gurdwaras. religion is a central part of our country. and as a political leader, anybody who invites me to a centre of belief, i will go as long as they treat people with respect and compassion,” he said., mr. gandhi’s articulation seems to reflect the congress’s effort to take a nuanced position on the question of religion in politics. increasingly words like ‘secularism’ are being replaced in the congress lexicon with phrases like “peace and love among communities.”, asked about the prospects of his party in the may 12 karnataka assembly elections, he claimed that the party would win karnataka ‘hands down’ as there was no sense of anti-incumbency against the siddaramaiah government. he also countered prime minister narendra modi’s 10% jibe at mr. siddaramaiah by pointing out that while mr. yeddyurappa had spent time in jail, there were no scams and charges of corruption against the chief minister., excerpts from the interview:, the main issue is carrying everybody together, making sure development goes to the needy ... the weak, and government resources go to the people it belongs to instead of being siphoned off like they were during the bjp regime. corruption is a big issue here — corruption of the bjp and mr. yeddyurappa, the reddy brothers and ₹35,000 crore stolen from the people of karnataka. and then the assault on karnataka by the bjp/rss and a centralising one-view vision of india is unacceptable. people of karnataka feel that they have their own language, they have their own culture and they don’t want to be run by the rss., the bjp design is that of submission. so the bjp goes pretty much into every conversation and state with the idea that they are going to impose one view and capture institutions., i am not a soothsayer and don’t get into seat predictions. but i can say that we are going to win this election., that is the narrative the bjp is trying to spread. the fact of the matter is there is consolidation behind the congress and our chief minister, siddaramaiah, the respect for the work he has done for the past five years. and there is a tremendous emotional response. so we are very much confident that we are going to win hands down., of course, the bjp would like to create such a narrative. independent channels in gujarat gave us 20-30 seats. so, i am not a believer of the so-called independent channels. i think we are very strong., no. it will not come to that., my view about karnataka elections is that i can’t sense any anti-incumbency against the siddaramaiah government. second, there is a clear feeling among the people of karnataka that a choice between mr. b.s. yeddyurappa and mr. siddaramaiah is no choice. it’s so one-sided that an even comparison does not hold. mr. siddarmaiahji is head and shoulders above what the bjp has., mr. modi’s political style is to divide and create anger. and he does that in every election. the closer he comes to the election, the harder he tries to do that. it will not work in karnataka. if you see mr. modi’s campaign, he can’t talk about corruption, right? he tried, it doesn’t work. his own people said the karnataka model is the best model. bjp president amit shah said mr. yeddyurappa’s government was most corrupt. union minister nitin gadkari said karnataka has the best roads. narendra modi himself said karnataka has got the most exemplary record in job creation. he has nothing to say and then he attacks me personally, attacks mr. siddaramaiah personally, attacks mallikarjun kharge personally; that’s his style. it’s a style of distracting., the fact of the matter is mr. yeddyurappa has spent time in jail. the fact of the matter is the reddy brothers have stolen ₹35,000 crore in the mining scam. mr. narendra modi is promoting these people. look at our last five years — there has been no scam, no charges of corruption. mr. modi comes and speaks about corruption, and on his left and right side, there is the whole tainted team. he speaks of divisive politics and everybody knows what mr. modi is doing over his whole career. his words ring quite hollow. the prime minister of india basically promised four things: two crore jobs per year, but his own government acknowledges an eight-year high in unemployment; he assured correct prices to farmers — you will see in the expression of india’s farmers how successful he has been! he spoke about corruption, you can see mr. amit shah’s son has turned ₹50,000 into ₹80 crore. you can see mr. piyush goyal sold his own company to a power company, the rajasthan cm’s son had been given money by lalit modi. there is the gspc scam of gujarat to answer. so modi can’t speak on corruption., finally, the pm spoke about robust foreign policy. he has just visited china, but didn’t say a word about doklam. instead of lecturing mr. siddaramaiah, the pm should explain what he has done on all these fronts., there is a difference between giving voice to a community and crushing a community. there is a difference between listening to the legitimate demands of a community and beating and killing dalits., what the bjp does is systematically crush a community! you see what the bjp is doing with dalits across the nation, you can see with rohit vemula, you can see in una, in every single bjp-ruled state, dalits are being beaten up, butchered and bashed and the prime minister doesn’t say a word. you know the status of minorities across country., in your question, you didn’t say that i also visit churches, mosques and gurdwaras. religion is a central part of our country. and as a political leader, anybody who invites me to a centre of belief, i will go, as long as they treat people with respect and compassion. i will not go to places which spread hatred, violence and divide community., let me make it very clear, i have been visiting temples, mosques, gurdwaras throughout my career. whenever a yatra or political procession passes by a religious place and someone invites me, i go. no, there is no image correction. but whenever i enter a temple, it deeply disturbs the bjp because they seem to think they own them temples., who did the bjp project in haryana?

2018-05-14,trust in the time of polls ,"elections in india are often described as a carnival of democracy. they pave the way for the smooth transition of power from one party or a set of parties to another. they reflect the will of the people. however, over the last decade, the process has also become a source of disinformation, calculated lies and falsification of history. how did we reach here? what can we do to redeem the information space for credible, trustworthy and reliable news? what should we do when our leaders deliberately misrepresent facts? , disinformation campaigns, the just-concluded assembly election in karnataka exemplifies the problem. some readers may point out the role of disinformation in the election of u.s. president donald trump and in the brexit referendum. this may indeed be a global problem. but my concern as a readers’ editor of an indian newspaper is about the indian information ecology which is getting murkier by the day. the problem with disinformation campaigns is that they develop a trajectory of their own where even well-settled facts are reduced to mere conjecture. , i am neither nostalgic nor romantic about the past. but this does not mean that i do not have a historical perspective, especially in the way the media handled sensitive information during elections until recently. , the indian media has never been a monolith. for every credible news outlet, there has been a corresponding sensationalist tabloid as a counterpoint. but the sensationalists were kept under control; there was some form of a social leash. there was an invisible firewall that separated these two universes. however, in the last five to six years, this firewall seems to have lost its power — disinformation is seeping into credible sections of the media because the source of disinformation happens to be our own leaders. this poses a difficult question about the nature of reporting. faithful reporting means reporting what was said. but if statements themselves are wrong, do reporters write about them or not? wouldn’t not reporting amount to censorship? , for a legacy newspaper like the hindu, the procedure is multilayered. reporters file stories on important speeches without adding their own comments. then they report the counterarguments. the opinion pages are used to debunk the lies. this demarcation between news and views helps in three ways: it documents statements as they are made; it records the statements of those who contest their truth; and the opinion pages provide not only the right information but also the context. the growth of the electronic media, with its single-minded focus on prime-time cacophony, seems to undermine the balance between reporting and opinion. , the methodology for exit polls, the fact-check website, alt news, has listed some of the most viral false stories in the run-up to the karnataka elections. we may never know how many voters believed these stories, but the fact that political parties believe in engaging in disinformation campaigns for electoral gains is disturbing. while a section of the media is struggling to retain the public’s trust by walking the extra mile in ensuring due journalistic process, another section is actually undermining the public’s trust by indulging in weird exit polls.

2018-05-14,trust in the time of polls ,"elections in india are often described as a carnival of democracy. they pave the way for the smooth transition of power from one party or a set of parties to another. they reflect the will of the people. however, over the last decade, the process has also become a source of disinformation, calculated lies and falsification of history. how did we reach here? what can we do to redeem the information space for credible, trustworthy and reliable news? what should we do when our leaders deliberately misrepresent facts? , disinformation campaigns, the just-concluded assembly election in karnataka exemplifies the problem. some readers may point out the role of disinformation in the election of u.s. president donald trump and in the brexit referendum. this may indeed be a global problem. but my concern as a readers’ editor of an indian newspaper is about the indian information ecology which is getting murkier by the day. the problem with disinformation campaigns is that they develop a trajectory of their own where even well-settled facts are reduced to mere conjecture. , i am neither nostalgic nor romantic about the past. but this does not mean that i do not have a historical perspective, especially in the way the media handled sensitive information during elections until recently. , the indian media has never been a monolith. for every credible news outlet, there has been a corresponding sensationalist tabloid as a counterpoint. but the sensationalists were kept under control; there was some form of a social leash. there was an invisible firewall that separated these two universes. however, in the last five to six years, this firewall seems to have lost its power — disinformation is seeping into credible sections of the media because the source of disinformation happens to be our own leaders. this poses a difficult question about the nature of reporting. faithful reporting means reporting what was said. but if statements themselves are wrong, do reporters write about them or not? wouldn’t not reporting amount to censorship? , for a legacy newspaper like the hindu, the procedure is multilayered. reporters file stories on important speeches without adding their own comments. then they report the counterarguments. the opinion pages are used to debunk the lies. this demarcation between news and views helps in three ways: it documents statements as they are made; it records the statements of those who contest their truth; and the opinion pages provide not only the right information but also the context. the growth of the electronic media, with its single-minded focus on prime-time cacophony, seems to undermine the balance between reporting and opinion. , the methodology for exit polls, the fact-check website, alt news, has listed some of the most viral false stories in the run-up to the karnataka elections. we may never know how many voters believed these stories, but the fact that political parties believe in engaging in disinformation campaigns for electoral gains is disturbing. while a section of the media is struggling to retain the public’s trust by walking the extra mile in ensuring due journalistic process, another section is actually undermining the public’s trust by indulging in weird exit polls.

2018-05-21, the data conundrum ,"a theme that i have visited many times in the last six years is the use of data in enriching journalism. in an earlier column, “new skills for new challenges” (may 18, 2015), i had argued that for data journalism to gain gravitas, journalists must develop skills not only to understand quantitative methods but also to grasp the qualitative inputs that go into the process of data collection. in the last three years, we have seen data being presented in an engaging manner, with even a daily graphic, ‘data point’, being featured on the op-ed page., with context, data are illuminating; without it, data become a confusing set of numbers. last week, the hindu data team managed to illuminate and confuse. the team produced one of its finest data stories following the karnataka election results in “to the spoiler belongs the victory?” (may 16, 2018). the one that failed the readers’ test was “ministry report card”, published on may 15., professor vinod pavarala, chair holder for the unesco chair on community media at the university of hyderabad and one of the earliest campaigners for community radio in india, wrote about “ministry report card”: “i am really puzzled by how the newspaper’s editors have allowed this in print. an interesting and aesthetically presented graphic in itself cannot be the reason, when you do not give readers any useful information to assess the credibility of this rating. we don’t know what this localcircles, described simply as ‘a community social media platform’, is. how can its registered users constitute any kind of a scientific sample for the credible ranking of ministries, however crude the ranking scale itself maybe? this is a nothing story/graphic really, one where more information is hidden than it is revealed.”, professor pavarala is right. the infographic was incomplete. the data team wanted to give some background about localcircles, the sample size as well as the methodology. they wanted to explain how localcircles has 10,000 registered users across cities and about its regular polling on many issues. they also wanted to explain how localcircles votes on ministries based on a ministry’s work compared to the party manifesto. but they were hit by a technical glitch. instead of holding back the story for the next day, they went ahead and published the evaluation of various ministries with the hope that it would make sense to the readers. it did not. data stories dealing with policy issues are not breaking news and holding them for a day will not cause any harm., the new york times has four golden rules for data journalism: provide context, describe processes, reveal patterns and explain the geography. these rules apply to indian data journalists too. the assistant managing editor of the new york times, matthew ericson, who was earlier deputy graphics editor, observed: “graphics should bring something new to the story, not just repeat the information in the lead. a graphics team that simply illustrates what the reporter has already told the audience is not doing its job properly. a graphic can bring together a variety of stories and provide context.” in the case of “ministry report card”, we don’t know whether the participants are from urban areas or rural areas, we do not have data relating to gender, and we do not know about the online polling methodology.",0.08566274994846422,data conundrum,"theme visited many times last six years use data enriching journalism. earlier column , “new skills new challenges ” ( may 18 , 2015 ) , argued data journalism gain gravitas , journalists must develop skills understand quantitative methods also grasp qualitative inputs go process data collection. last three years , seen data presented engaging manner , even daily graphic , ‘data point ’ , featured op-ed page. , context , data illuminating ; without , data become confusing set numbers. last week , hindu data team managed illuminate confuse. team produced one finest data stories following karnataka election results “to spoiler belongs victory ?

2018-05-21,the fight for survival ,"the congress’s swift announcement on may 15, the day of the karnataka assembly results, that it was willing to form a government with the smaller janata dal (secular) in the leadership role has not just forced the bharatiya janata party (bjp) to step down in the state but has also galvanised many non-bjp parties across the country into action. west bengal chief minister mamata bannerjee, bahujan samaj party supremo mayawati, telangana chief minister k. chandrasekar rao, andhra pradesh chief minister n. chandrababu naidu, kerala chief minister pinarayi vijayan, communist party of india (marxist) general secretary sitaram yechury and even the off-and-on bjp ally shiv sena have all come out in support of this arrangement. dravida munnetra kazhagam working president m.k. stalin described karnataka governor vajubhai vala’s invitation to the bjp to form the government as a move “that will only serve to enable horse-trading and destroy our democratic foundations.”, now, after the congress-jd(s) combine’s success in preventing any of its mlas from crossing over to the bjp, forcing b.s. yeddyurappa to resign as chief minister before the vote of confidence, h.d. kumaraswamy’s swearing-in on may 23 is likely to be a show of strength of opposition parties as many non-bjp leaders are scheduled to attend the ceremony. the congress’s decision to concede space to a smaller party has sent out an unequivocal message to the rest of the opposition: it may be the principal opposition party with a national footprint (despite being in power in only three states and one union territory now), but if not in power, it is willing to cooperate with regional parties and even accept their leadership in the larger interest of ensuring a secular government., indeed, it is a more significant decision than the one the congress took in 1996 to back the h.d. deve gowda-led janata dal to form a government at the centre following the collapse of the 13-day atal bihari vajpayee government. even if the congress at the time was also motivated by the idea of keeping the bjp out of power, it essentially saw it as a temporary arrangement till it could figure out its next political move. at that time, the congress had won 140 lok sabha seats, 21 behind the bjp’s 161, but it had polled 28.8% of the national vote, ahead of the bjp’s 20.29%. earlier, in 1989, when incidentally it had emerged as the single largest party in parliament, both in seat share (197) and vote share (39.53%), taking note of the national mood that favoured the v.p. singh-led national front, it took a back seat. in 1991, the party returned to power and ruled for five years., but while the congress’s decision to not make a bid for power in 1989 and 1996 was based on sound and correct politics, what its leaders failed to recognise at the time was that the ground beneath their feet was slowly slipping. there were new social realities: the rise of other backward classes and the growing appeal of hindu majoritarianism. simultaneously, the economic reforms set in motion by its government in 1991 had generated new aspirations as the middle class grew at a faster clip. the congress may have been instrumental in creating the new middle class, but its association with nehruvian socialism and the english-speaking elite which, until then, had held sway over top professional jobs was enough for large sections of the new middle class, especially in smaller towns, to begin to look at the bjp as their real representative. the congress may have noted the changes but it failed to address them directly., in 2004, after six years of the bjp-led national democratic alliance rule, the congress was back in power, on the promise of pluralism. but the party failed to use its decade in power to revamp its organisation to meet the challenges posed by the social changes that were taking place across india. the rise of identity-based politics saw the congress, which was once an umbrella party that drew all sections of society, whether defined by religion, region, caste, language or class, into its embrace, wither away., today, as the karnataka elections have demonstrated, there is no section on which the congress can depend on for votes. as suhas palshikar wrote in party competition in indian states: electoral politics in post-congress polity: “like during the nineties, in the 2014 lok sabha elections also, the congress has not only failed to secure robust vote share, but it has failed to have any social character to its vote. that is why we have mentioned the flatness of its base across social groups. polling only under 20 per cent vote is bad enough, but not polling more among any social group is really the worst part of the congress’s failure in 2014. this failure indicates the larger decimation of the party than the overall vote share indicates. in a sense, this defeat might be better understood if we compare the congress of 2014 with the congress of 1998-99. the ephemeral ‘victory’ in 2004 and the slight recovery of 2009 were, in retrospect, only temporary features of those elections. they did not bring a trend or a reversal of the decline of the congress.” the results of successive state elections since 2014 have only underlined this fact.",-0.004007696007696007,fight survival,"congress ’

2018-05-21,the fight for survival ,"the congress’s swift announcement on may 15, the day of the karnataka assembly results, that it was willing to form a government with the smaller janata dal (secular) in the leadership role has not just forced the bharatiya janata party (bjp) to step down in the state but has also galvanised many non-bjp parties across the country into action. west bengal chief minister mamata bannerjee, bahujan samaj party supremo mayawati, telangana chief minister k. chandrasekar rao, andhra pradesh chief minister n. chandrababu naidu, kerala chief minister pinarayi vijayan, communist party of india (marxist) general secretary sitaram yechury and even the off-and-on bjp ally shiv sena have all come out in support of this arrangement. dravida munnetra kazhagam working president m.k. stalin described karnataka governor vajubhai vala’s invitation to the bjp to form the government as a move “that will only serve to enable horse-trading and destroy our democratic foundations.”, now, after the congress-jd(s) combine’s success in preventing any of its mlas from crossing over to the bjp, forcing b.s. yeddyurappa to resign as chief minister before the vote of confidence, h.d. kumaraswamy’s swearing-in on may 23 is likely to be a show of strength of opposition parties as many non-bjp leaders are scheduled to attend the ceremony. the congress’s decision to concede space to a smaller party has sent out an unequivocal message to the rest of the opposition: it may be the principal opposition party with a national footprint (despite being in power in only three states and one union territory now), but if not in power, it is willing to cooperate with regional parties and even accept their leadership in the larger interest of ensuring a secular government., indeed, it is a more significant decision than the one the congress took in 1996 to back the h.d. deve gowda-led janata dal to form a government at the centre following the collapse of the 13-day atal bihari vajpayee government. even if the congress at the time was also motivated by the idea of keeping the bjp out of power, it essentially saw it as a temporary arrangement till it could figure out its next political move. at that time, the congress had won 140 lok sabha seats, 21 behind the bjp’s 161, but it had polled 28.8% of the national vote, ahead of the bjp’s 20.29%. earlier, in 1989, when incidentally it had emerged as the single largest party in parliament, both in seat share (197) and vote share (39.53%), taking note of the national mood that favoured the v.p. singh-led national front, it took a back seat. in 1991, the party returned to power and ruled for five years., but while the congress’s decision to not make a bid for power in 1989 and 1996 was based on sound and correct politics, what its leaders failed to recognise at the time was that the ground beneath their feet was slowly slipping. there were new social realities: the rise of other backward classes and the growing appeal of hindu majoritarianism. simultaneously, the economic reforms set in motion by its government in 1991 had generated new aspirations as the middle class grew at a faster clip. the congress may have been instrumental in creating the new middle class, but its association with nehruvian socialism and the english-speaking elite which, until then, had held sway over top professional jobs was enough for large sections of the new middle class, especially in smaller towns, to begin to look at the bjp as their real representative. the congress may have noted the changes but it failed to address them directly., in 2004, after six years of the bjp-led national democratic alliance rule, the congress was back in power, on the promise of pluralism. but the party failed to use its decade in power to revamp its organisation to meet the challenges posed by the social changes that were taking place across india. the rise of identity-based politics saw the congress, which was once an umbrella party that drew all sections of society, whether defined by religion, region, caste, language or class, into its embrace, wither away., today, as the karnataka elections have demonstrated, there is no section on which the congress can depend on for votes. as suhas palshikar wrote in party competition in indian states: electoral politics in post-congress polity: “like during the nineties, in the 2014 lok sabha elections also, the congress has not only failed to secure robust vote share, but it has failed to have any social character to its vote. that is why we have mentioned the flatness of its base across social groups. polling only under 20 per cent vote is bad enough, but not polling more among any social group is really the worst part of the congress’s failure in 2014. this failure indicates the larger decimation of the party than the overall vote share indicates. in a sense, this defeat might be better understood if we compare the congress of 2014 with the congress of 1998-99. the ephemeral ‘victory’ in 2004 and the slight recovery of 2009 were, in retrospect, only temporary features of those elections. they did not bring a trend or a reversal of the decline of the congress.” the results of successive state elections since 2014 have only underlined this fact.",-0.004007696007696007,fight survival,"congress ’

2018-05-21, the data conundrum ,"a theme that i have visited many times in the last six years is the use of data in enriching journalism. in an earlier column, “new skills for new challenges” (may 18, 2015), i had argued that for data journalism to gain gravitas, journalists must develop skills not only to understand quantitative methods but also to grasp the qualitative inputs that go into the process of data collection. in the last three years, we have seen data being presented in an engaging manner, with even a daily graphic, ‘data point’, being featured on the op-ed page., with context, data are illuminating; without it, data become a confusing set of numbers. last week, the hindu data team managed to illuminate and confuse. the team produced one of its finest data stories following the karnataka election results in “to the spoiler belongs the victory?” (may 16, 2018). the one that failed the readers’ test was “ministry report card”, published on may 15., professor vinod pavarala, chair holder for the unesco chair on community media at the university of hyderabad and one of the earliest campaigners for community radio in india, wrote about “ministry report card”: “i am really puzzled by how the newspaper’s editors have allowed this in print. an interesting and aesthetically presented graphic in itself cannot be the reason, when you do not give readers any useful information to assess the credibility of this rating. we don’t know what this localcircles, described simply as ‘a community social media platform’, is. how can its registered users constitute any kind of a scientific sample for the credible ranking of ministries, however crude the ranking scale itself maybe? this is a nothing story/graphic really, one where more information is hidden than it is revealed.”, professor pavarala is right. the infographic was incomplete. the data team wanted to give some background about localcircles, the sample size as well as the methodology. they wanted to explain how localcircles has 10,000 registered users across cities and about its regular polling on many issues. they also wanted to explain how localcircles votes on ministries based on a ministry’s work compared to the party manifesto. but they were hit by a technical glitch. instead of holding back the story for the next day, they went ahead and published the evaluation of various ministries with the hope that it would make sense to the readers. it did not. data stories dealing with policy issues are not breaking news and holding them for a day will not cause any harm., the new york times has four golden rules for data journalism: provide context, describe processes, reveal patterns and explain the geography. these rules apply to indian data journalists too. the assistant managing editor of the new york times, matthew ericson, who was earlier deputy graphics editor, observed: “graphics should bring something new to the story, not just repeat the information in the lead. a graphics team that simply illustrates what the reporter has already told the audience is not doing its job properly. a graphic can bring together a variety of stories and provide context.” in the case of “ministry report card”, we don’t know whether the participants are from urban areas or rural areas, we do not have data relating to gender, and we do not know about the online polling methodology.",0.08566274994846422,data conundrum,"theme visited many times last six years use data enriching journalism. earlier column , “new skills new challenges ” ( may 18 , 2015 ) , argued data journalism gain gravitas , journalists must develop skills understand quantitative methods also grasp qualitative inputs go process data collection. last three years , seen data presented engaging manner , even daily graphic , ‘data point ’ , featured op-ed page. , context , data illuminating ; without , data become confusing set numbers. last week , hindu data team managed illuminate confuse. team produced one finest data stories following karnataka election results “to spoiler belongs victory ?

2018-05-24, do we need the office of the governor?," , among all the players who strutted and fretted across the stage during the recently concluded karnataka elections, it is the governor of the state, vajubhai vala, who emerged with least credit to his name. his decision to first invite the bharatiya janata party (bjp) to take a stab at forming the government was perhaps a legitimate exercise of his constitutional discretion (albeit without any recorded reasons for ignoring the post-poll congress-janata dal (secular) alliance’s claims to having an absolute majority). however, the invitation was extended at 9 p.m., and the swearing in fixed for 9.30 a.m. the next day, ostensibly to ward off any judicial challenges, and present a fait accompli., his decision to grant b.s. yeddyurappa 15 days to prove his majority, when the latter himself asked for only a week, was troubling enough for the supreme court to intervene and order an immediate floor test. so was his appointment of bjp mla k.g. bopaiah as pro tem speaker to conduct the floor test, when the latter had been castigated by the supreme court in 2011 for partisan conduct (although this time the court chose not to intervene). each of the governor’s actions was taken in that uncertain grey area of “discretion” — partisan enough to skew the process in favour of the bjp, but not illegal enough to warrant judicial intervention., short-term options, in the aftermath, some have called upon the governor to resign; others have suggested that the post of the governor be reserved for non-political appointees; and still others have urged the supreme court to lay down the law on how the governor ought to act when an election yields a fractured verdict. all of these, however, are patchwork solutions that miss the point: the flaw lies not with the identity of the individual who occupies the post, but in the design of the constitution itself. if we want to put an end to the continuous misuse of the raj bhavan for partisan political ends in a manner that threatens both federalism and democracy, we have to rethink the role of the governor in the constitutional scheme., to do that, it is important to understand the origins of the office in the colonial british regime. through the course of the early 20th century, the indian nationalist movement managed to extract gradual and incremental reforms towards responsible government from the british rulers. these reforms culminated in the government of india act, 1935 which established provincial legislative assemblies elected from a limited franchise., however, in order to ensure that overriding power remained with the british, the act retained the post of governor (a holdover from the old, “diarchy” system), and vested him with “special responsibilities” that, in essence, allowed for intervention at will. in a searing critique, k.t. shah (who was later one of the most articulate members of the constituent assembly, or ca), wrote that the governor would inevitably be biased in his functioning, and his actions would remain at odds with those of popularly elected ministers., despite the nationalist movement’s bitter experience with governors over almost three decades, the ca chose to retain the post, and continue to vest it with discretionary power. during ca debates, it was pointed out that the articles dealing with the powers of the governor were almost verbatim reproductions of the 1935 act. defenders of the office raised two broad arguments: first, that there was a dearth of competent legislators in the states; and second, that a certain amount of centralisation of power was necessary in a nascent state such as india. concerned members of the ca were assured that the governor would remain only a constitutional post, and would have no power to interfere in the day-to-day administration of the state. however, when rohini kumar chaudhari raised a particularly prescient concern about the governor’s powers to “form the first ministry” and call upon “anyone, whether he has a big majority or a substantial minority”, this was brushed aside by saying that a no-confidence motion could soon resolve such issues., a constitutional ‘choke point’, the ca debates around the office of the governor reveal an important point. the constitution was the culmination of the democratic aspirations of the people, and its major pillars — universal adult suffrage, the parliamentary system, fundamental rights — are all expressions of those aspirations. but there were also moments where the framers lacked the courage of their convictions. if granting universal adult suffrage at one stroke was a leap of faith, then at other places, driven by concerns about maintaining national integrity and preventing disintegration in the teeth of the trauma of partition, the framers pulled up short. they were committed to federalism — but not too much federalism, for fear of secession; they were committed to popular democracy, but also wanted to retain some manner of control, lest democracy unleash the kinds of passions that would trigger its own destruction. the office of the governor represented one such “choke point” in the constitution (ordinances and emergencies are others), where federalism and the popular will were to be kept in check from above, if the occasion ever arose., the occasion arose very soon. soon after the first general elections, the state of madras went to the polls in 1952. in a 375-member assembly, the united democratic front (udf), a coalition of parties, held 166 seats. the congress finished with 152., the governor, sri prakasa, ignored the udf’s claim to form the government, and instead invited the congress, which did form the government with rajaji as chief minister, after engineering several splits and defections (including through offers of cabinet posts). the civil rights lawyer, k.g. kannabiran, writes that “on this act of impropriety rajaji became the chief minister of the first congress government after independence.” rohini kumar chaudhari’s fears had come true, and the justification was eerily similar: the udf’s communist orientation rendered it ineligible to govern (no matter how the people voted), and it was incumbent upon the government to ensure an orderly government. and so it has been ever thus.",0.1111928104575163,need office governor ?,", among players strutted fretted across stage recently concluded karnataka elections , governor state , vajubhai vala , emerged least credit name. decision first invite bharatiya janata party ( bjp ) take stab forming government perhaps legitimate exercise constitutional discretion ( albeit without recorded reasons ignoring post-poll congress-janata dal ( secular ) alliance ’ claims absolute majority ) . however , invitation extended 9 p.m. , swearing fixed 9.30 a.m. next day , ostensibly ward judicial challenges , present fait accompli. , decision grant b.s. yeddyurappa 15 days prove majority , latter asked week , troubling enough supreme court intervene order immediate floor test. appointment bjp mla k.g. bopaiah pro tem speaker conduct floor test , latter castigated supreme court 2011 partisan conduct ( although time court chose intervene ) . governor ’ actions taken uncertain grey area “discretion ” — partisan enough skew process favour bjp , illegal enough warrant judicial intervention. , short-term options , aftermath , called upon governor resign ;

2018-05-24, do we need the office of the governor?," , among all the players who strutted and fretted across the stage during the recently concluded karnataka elections, it is the governor of the state, vajubhai vala, who emerged with least credit to his name. his decision to first invite the bharatiya janata party (bjp) to take a stab at forming the government was perhaps a legitimate exercise of his constitutional discretion (albeit without any recorded reasons for ignoring the post-poll congress-janata dal (secular) alliance’s claims to having an absolute majority). however, the invitation was extended at 9 p.m., and the swearing in fixed for 9.30 a.m. the next day, ostensibly to ward off any judicial challenges, and present a fait accompli., his decision to grant b.s. yeddyurappa 15 days to prove his majority, when the latter himself asked for only a week, was troubling enough for the supreme court to intervene and order an immediate floor test. so was his appointment of bjp mla k.g. bopaiah as pro tem speaker to conduct the floor test, when the latter had been castigated by the supreme court in 2011 for partisan conduct (although this time the court chose not to intervene). each of the governor’s actions was taken in that uncertain grey area of “discretion” — partisan enough to skew the process in favour of the bjp, but not illegal enough to warrant judicial intervention., short-term options, in the aftermath, some have called upon the governor to resign; others have suggested that the post of the governor be reserved for non-political appointees; and still others have urged the supreme court to lay down the law on how the governor ought to act when an election yields a fractured verdict. all of these, however, are patchwork solutions that miss the point: the flaw lies not with the identity of the individual who occupies the post, but in the design of the constitution itself. if we want to put an end to the continuous misuse of the raj bhavan for partisan political ends in a manner that threatens both federalism and democracy, we have to rethink the role of the governor in the constitutional scheme., to do that, it is important to understand the origins of the office in the colonial british regime. through the course of the early 20th century, the indian nationalist movement managed to extract gradual and incremental reforms towards responsible government from the british rulers. these reforms culminated in the government of india act, 1935 which established provincial legislative assemblies elected from a limited franchise., however, in order to ensure that overriding power remained with the british, the act retained the post of governor (a holdover from the old, “diarchy” system), and vested him with “special responsibilities” that, in essence, allowed for intervention at will. in a searing critique, k.t. shah (who was later one of the most articulate members of the constituent assembly, or ca), wrote that the governor would inevitably be biased in his functioning, and his actions would remain at odds with those of popularly elected ministers., despite the nationalist movement’s bitter experience with governors over almost three decades, the ca chose to retain the post, and continue to vest it with discretionary power. during ca debates, it was pointed out that the articles dealing with the powers of the governor were almost verbatim reproductions of the 1935 act. defenders of the office raised two broad arguments: first, that there was a dearth of competent legislators in the states; and second, that a certain amount of centralisation of power was necessary in a nascent state such as india. concerned members of the ca were assured that the governor would remain only a constitutional post, and would have no power to interfere in the day-to-day administration of the state. however, when rohini kumar chaudhari raised a particularly prescient concern about the governor’s powers to “form the first ministry” and call upon “anyone, whether he has a big majority or a substantial minority”, this was brushed aside by saying that a no-confidence motion could soon resolve such issues., a constitutional ‘choke point’, the ca debates around the office of the governor reveal an important point. the constitution was the culmination of the democratic aspirations of the people, and its major pillars — universal adult suffrage, the parliamentary system, fundamental rights — are all expressions of those aspirations. but there were also moments where the framers lacked the courage of their convictions. if granting universal adult suffrage at one stroke was a leap of faith, then at other places, driven by concerns about maintaining national integrity and preventing disintegration in the teeth of the trauma of partition, the framers pulled up short. they were committed to federalism — but not too much federalism, for fear of secession; they were committed to popular democracy, but also wanted to retain some manner of control, lest democracy unleash the kinds of passions that would trigger its own destruction. the office of the governor represented one such “choke point” in the constitution (ordinances and emergencies are others), where federalism and the popular will were to be kept in check from above, if the occasion ever arose., the occasion arose very soon. soon after the first general elections, the state of madras went to the polls in 1952. in a 375-member assembly, the united democratic front (udf), a coalition of parties, held 166 seats. the congress finished with 152., the governor, sri prakasa, ignored the udf’s claim to form the government, and instead invited the congress, which did form the government with rajaji as chief minister, after engineering several splits and defections (including through offers of cabinet posts). the civil rights lawyer, k.g. kannabiran, writes that “on this act of impropriety rajaji became the chief minister of the first congress government after independence.” rohini kumar chaudhari’s fears had come true, and the justification was eerily similar: the udf’s communist orientation rendered it ineligible to govern (no matter how the people voted), and it was incumbent upon the government to ensure an orderly government. and so it has been ever thus.",0.1111928104575163,need office governor ?,", among players strutted fretted across stage recently concluded karnataka elections , governor state , vajubhai vala , emerged least credit name. decision first invite bharatiya janata party ( bjp ) take stab forming government perhaps legitimate exercise constitutional discretion ( albeit without recorded reasons ignoring post-poll congress-janata dal ( secular ) alliance ’ claims absolute majority ) . however , invitation extended 9 p.m. , swearing fixed 9.30 a.m. next day , ostensibly ward judicial challenges , present fait accompli. , decision grant b.s. yeddyurappa 15 days prove majority , latter asked week , troubling enough supreme court intervene order immediate floor test. appointment bjp mla k.g. bopaiah pro tem speaker conduct floor test , latter castigated supreme court 2011 partisan conduct ( although time court chose intervene ) . governor ’ actions taken uncertain grey area “discretion ” — partisan enough skew process favour bjp , illegal enough warrant judicial intervention. , short-term options , aftermath , called upon governor resign ;

2018-06-25, the tools for counting,"as the 2011 census approached, demands for inclusion of data on caste in census reached a crescendo. p. chidambaram, the union home minister at the time, was opposed to collecting caste data and blocked it by claiming that it was logistically impossible for the census, but caste information could be collected via the planned below poverty line (bpl) census, later renamed the socio-economic and caste census (secc). hasty inclusion of the caste question in the secc has resulted in largely unusable data. the government tasked former niti aayog chairman arvind panagariya to look into this, but the effort has stalled. consequently, if we want information regarding the size and characteristics of various castes in india, we must continue to look to the census of 1931., it is hard to imagine that the 2021 census will not face another slew of demands for collection of caste data. it also seems likely that once again we will be unprepared for a full caste census. if we really want to collect data on caste in india and not let the discourse about indian society be shaped by the political exigencies of colonial india, the time to plan is now., should we collect data on caste? some would argue that the simple act of asking about caste creates a chasm within society. part of this resistance comes from reaction to the preoccupation of colonial administrators-turned-arm-chair anthropologists who saw caste as the defining feature of indian society. colonial censuses, beginning with the first census in 1871, included questions about caste and used these data to divide and conquer india by first privileging brahmins as interpreters of indian culture and then targeting them as the roots of caste-based oppression and inequality., g.s. ghurye, the early 20th century pioneer of indian sociology, reacted sharply by identifying this passion for classification as the source of anti-brahmin movements. veena das, doyenne of modern indian anthropology, also notes that the colonial censuses via the process of recording caste generated a conception of community as a homogeneous and classifiable community and thereby influenced the processes of political representation. consequently, post-independence censuses have shied away from including questions about caste., the challenge for modern india lies in figuring out whether caste-based political mobilisation and strong sentiments for or against reservations would disappear just because we choose not to collect statistics about caste. patels, gujjars, jats and marathas do not seem to care about the lack of census data as they demand reservations. nor has the caste cauldron of karnataka elections calmed because we can only roughly estimate the size of the lingayat and vokkaliga communities., our political systems, civil society and courts continue to assume that broad caste-based social categories — dalits, adivasis, other backward classes (obcs) and upper castes — defined largely using data from 1931 census and a few special purpose surveys continue to shape economic conditions in 21st century india. without accurate data at a granular level for each of these categories consisting of thousands of jatis (castes) and upjatis (subcastes), we have no way of knowing whether this is correct., indian society has undergone a tremendous transformation since 1931. land ownership that bolstered the power of upper castes has lost its hold. land fragmentation and decades of agricultural stagnation have turned many upper caste landowners into marginal farmers barely eking out a subsistence. while landlessness, once the bane of dalit existence, has left the landless better poised to take advantage of rising rural wages, particularly construction wages. consequently, while at a broad brushstroke the national sample survey (nss) shows that mean consumption expenditure of forward castes is higher than that of dalits, clusters of poverty persist among forward castes. according to nss data, the bottom fourth of forward castes are poorer than the top half of dalits. india human development survey shows that 56% of dalit children ages 8-11 cannot read but neither can 32% of forward caste and 47% of obc children., economic growth of the past century, combined with strong affirmation action undertaken by successive governments of the independent nation, may have changed relative fortunes of various groups. some jatis may have managed to pull themselves out poverty and marginalisation, while others may have sunk into it. hence, it is time to collect data that reflects the current situation., collection of caste data is not easy. the secc asked interviewers to write down the name of the caste exactly as articulated by the respondent. by some reports, it has revealed as many as 46 lakh castes. sometimes the same caste is spelt in different ways, at other times some individuals report their jati and others upjati making it difficult to create mutually exclusive categories. one cannot help but sympathise with the ministry of rural development and the ministry of housing and urban poverty alleviation which were asked to tack on a question about caste at the eleventh hour in the secc without any preparation.",0.05994105975723621,tools counting,"2011 census approached , demands inclusion data caste census reached crescendo. p. chidambaram , union home minister time , opposed collecting caste data blocked claiming logistically impossible census , caste information could collected via planned poverty line ( bpl ) census , later renamed socio-economic caste census ( secc ) . hasty inclusion caste question secc resulted largely unusable data. government tasked former niti aayog chairman arvind panagariya look , effort stalled. consequently , want information regarding size characteristics various castes india , must continue look census 1931. , hard imagine 2021 census face another slew demands collection caste data. also seems likely unprepared full caste census. really want collect data caste india let discourse indian society shaped political exigencies colonial india , time plan now. , collect data caste ?
