affairs minister venkiah naidu on thier way to address the joint session of parliament house in new delhi on monday. photo: r.v.moorthy , central hall of parliament, new delhi: 09-06-2014, honourable members, i am delighted to address this >first session of both houses of parliament after the elections to the 16th lok sabha. let me begin by extending warm greetings to my fellow citizens, who participated in large numbers in the recently concluded lok sabha elections. we should never forget that we are here because of them. serving them should be our first priority. i also felicitate the members of the new lok sabha. you have successfully obtained the mandate from the electorate and now you represent their hopes, aspirations and dreams. i extend a warm welcome to all of you and hope that the sessions ahead with heavy legislative agenda will be productive and useful., 2.it is a matter of great satisfaction that the recent general elections were smooth and largely peaceful. i would like to congratulate the election commission of india and the official machinery for conducting these elections successfully. the unprecedented interest shown by the people of india in the elections is a sign of progressive deepening of our vibrant democracy. before i dwell upon the tasks ahead of us, i would like to express my solidarity with the families of all those who lost their lives during the election process., 3.i congratulate the new speaker of the lok sabha on her unanimous election to this august office. by successively electing women speakers, the lok sabha has re-affirmed our age-old belief in the importance of women in our society., honourable members, 4.this has been an election of hope. it marks a turning point in the evolution of our democratic polity. the surge in aspirations and the belief that these could be realized through democratic processes, has been amply reflected in the record 66.4% participation by voters, and a clear verdict in favour of a single political party after a gap of nearly 30 years. the electorate transcended the boundaries of caste, creed, region and religion to come together and vote decisively in favour of development through good governance., 5.the country needed a strong and stable government that could provide effective leadership. in my republic day speech earlier this year, i had hoped for 2014 to be a year of healing after the fractured and contentious politics of the previous years. standing here today, i applaud the wisdom of my fellow citizens for having voted for stability, honesty and development in a resurgent india in which corruption will have no place. they have voted for a united, strong, and modern india - “ek bharat - shreshtha bharat”. my government will work to fulfill these aspirations; with the involvement of all the 125 crore people of this great country., 6.my government is committed to nurturing the right environment for actualizing this mandate of the people. for this, it pledges itself to the principle of ‘sabka saath, sabka vikas’; which can be fulfilled only through your active participation. we will work together to re-establish the credibility of the institutions of democracy. my government will function on the mantra of ‘minimum government, maximum governance’. in all our actions, we will be guided by the core values of our great civilization., honourable members, 7.my government is dedicated to the poor. poverty has no religion, hunger has no creed, and despair has no geography. the greatest challenge before us is to end the curse of poverty in india. my government will not be satisfied with mere “poverty alleviation”; and commits itself to the goal of “poverty elimination”. with a firm belief that the first claim on development belongs to the poor; the government will focus its attention on those who need the basic necessities of life most urgently. it will take necessary steps to provide security in its entirety to all citizens; through empathy, support and empowerment., 8.containing food inflation will be the topmost priority for my government. there would be an emphasis on improving the supply side of various agro and agro-based products. my government will take effective steps to prevent hoarding and black marketing. it will reform the public distribution system, incorporating best practices from the states. my government is alert about the possibility of a subnormal monsoon this year and contingency plans are being prepared., 9.despite more than two-thirds of our people living in rural areas; we have not been able to provide adequate public amenities and livelihood opportunities to them. my government is committed to improving the quality of life in our villages, through empowered panchayati raj institutions. a substantial part of investment will focus on creating community assets and improving basic infrastructure such as roads, shelter, power and drinking water. my government will strive to end the rural-urban divide guided by the idea of rurban; providing urban amenities to rural areas while preserving the ethos of the villages., 10.agriculture is the source of livelihood for majority of our people. in the recent past, our farmers have been under severe stress with hopelessness driving some of them to suicides. my government is committed to reversing this unfortunate trend. it will increase investment in agriculture, both public and private, especially in agri-infrastructure. steps will be taken to convert farming into a profitable venture through scientific practices and agro-technology. my government will address issues pertaining to pricing and procurement of agricultural produce, crop insurance and post-harvest management. productivity of animal husbandry will be increased. my government will incentivize the setting up of food processing industries. existing cooperative sector laws will be reviewed to remove anomalies and lacunae. my government will adopt a national land use policy which will facilitate scientific identification of non-cultivable land and its strategic development., 11.each drop of water is precious. my government is committed to giving high priority to water security. it will complete the long pending irrigation projects on priority and launch the ‘pradhan mantri krishi sinchayee yojana’ with the motto of ‘har khet ko paani’. there is a need for seriously considering all options including linking of rivers, where feasible; for ensuring optimal use of our water resources to prevent the recurrence of floods and drought. by harnessing rain water through ‘jal sanchay’ and ‘jal sinchan’, we will nurture water conservation and ground water recharge. micro irrigation will be popularised to ensure ‘per drop-more crop’., honourable members, 12.india is the world’s oldest civilization. today it is also a country with the largest population of the youth. we must equip and nurture our youth with the right kind of education, skill-set and opportunity to reap this demographic dividend. my government will strive to transition from youth development to youth-led development. it will set up massive open online courses and virtual classrooms. it will formulate a national education policy aimed at meeting the challenges posed by lack of quality, research and innovation in our educational institutions. we will set up iits and iims in every state. in order to empower school teachers and students, a national e-library will be established. with the motto of “har haath ko hunar”, my government will strive to break the barriers between formal education and skill development, and put in place a mechanism to give academic equivalence to vocational qualifications. with the goal of skilled india, my government will also launch a national multi-skill mission., 13. the children and youth of the country need avenues of recreation that develop them constructively and keep them fit. my government will launch a ‘national sports talent search system’. it will facilitate development and promotion of indian sports, particularly rural sports. sports will be popularised by making it an integral part of the school curriculum and providing educational incentives., 14.our country needs a holistic health care system that is universally accessible, affordable and effective. to achieve this objective, my government will formulate a new health policy and roll out a national health assurance mission. it will promote yoga and ayush. to address the shortfall of health care professionals, health education and training will be transformed. aiims like institutes will be established in every state in a phased manner., 15.we must not tolerate the indignity of homes without toilets and public spaces littered with garbage. for ensuring hygiene, waste management and sanitation across the nation a “swachh bharat mission” will be launched. this will be our tribute to mahatma gandhi on his 150th birth anniversary to be celebrated in the year 2019., 16.keeping in mind welfare of the people belonging to the scheduled castes, scheduled tribes, other backward classes and the weaker sections of our society; my government will take steps to create an enabling eco-system of equal opportunity in education, health and livelihood. my government is committed to see that those belonging to the scheduled castes and other backward classes are able to avail emerging opportunities. for the scheduled tribes, my government will launch a dedicated “van bandhu kalyan yojana”. electrification of tribal hamlets and connecting them with all-weather roads will be a priority area., 17.it is unfortunate that even after several decades of independence, sections of minority communities continue to suffer from poverty, as benefits of government schemes do not reach them. my government is committed to making all minorities equal partners in india’s progress. the government will especially strengthen measures to spread modern and technical education among minority communities and a national madarsa modernization programme will be initiated., 18.the welfare and rehabilitation of specially-abled people is integral to my government’s vision of a caring society. it will take steps to provide dignity of life to them by facilitating their participation in all walks of life. steps will be taken to identify their special needs and to provide institutional care to them., 19.my government recognizes the important role our women play in the development of our society and growth of the nation. it is committed to providing 33 per cent reservation to them in the parliament and state legislative assemblies. with a commitment of “beti bachao - beti padhao”, my government will launch a mass campaign for saving the girl child and enabling her education. it will structure a comprehensive scheme, incorporating best practices from states in this regard. in the recent past, the country has witnessed some grue some incidents of violence against women. the government will have a policy of zero tolerance for violence against women, and will strengthen the criminal justice system for its effective implementation., honourable members, 20.india is a federal polity. but, over the years, the federal spirit has been diluted. the states and the centre should function as an organic team india. in order to actively engage with the states on national issues, my government will reinvigorate fora like the national development council and the inter-state council. the centre will be an enabler in the rapid progress of states through cooperative federalism. state-specific development models will be developed taking into account the special needs and unique problems of coastal, hilly and desert areas. highest priority will be accorded to bring eastern region of the country on par with western region in terms of physical and social infrastructure. my government is committed to addressing the issues relating to development of andhra pradesh and telangana. the government will lay special emphasis on improving the intra-region connectivity and border infrastructure in the northeast as well as in jammu & kashmir. the issue of infiltration and illegal immigrants in the northeast region will be tackled on priority and all pending fencing work along the northeast border will be completed. special efforts will be made to ensure that kashmiri pandits return to the land of their ancestors with full dignity, security and assured livelihood., 21.my government is committed to providing a clean and efficient administration focussed on delivery. the institution of lok pal is important to curb corruption and my government will endeavour to formulate rules in conformity with the act. my government will take steps to build the confidence and morale of our bureaucracy; enabling it with the freedom to work, and welcoming innovative ideas. the government will stress on putting in place transparent systems and timebound delivery of government services. government systems and processes will be revisited to make them citizen friendly, corruption free and accountable. efforts will be made to eliminate obsolete laws, regulations, administrative structures and practices. rationalization and convergence among ministries, departments and other arms of the government will be ensured to have focussed delivery. digitization of government records will be done for improving accessibility., 22.e-governance brings empowerment, equity and efficiency. it has the power to transform peoples’ lives. the backbone of my government’s new ways of working will be a digital india. it will be used to drive re-engineering of government processes to improve service delivery and programme implementation. we will strive to provide wi-fi zones in critical public areas in the next five years. my government will rollout broad band highway to reach every village and make all schools e-enabled in a phased manner. technology will be used to prepare our children for a knowledge society. the national e-governance plan will be expanded to cover every government office from the centre to the panchayat; to provide a wide variety of services to citizens. emerging technologies like social media will be used as a tool for; participative governance, directly engaging the people in policy making and administration., 23.my government is determined to rid the country of the scourge of corruption and the menace of black money. as a first step in this direction, the government has already constituted a sit to unearth black money stashed abroad. this will be followed up vigorously by proactively engaging with foreign governments., 24.keeping in mind that justice delayed is justice denied, my government will adopt a multi-pronged approach to address the problem of high pendency of cases in our judicial system. it will progressively modernize the courts to improve their operational efficiency, and start reform of the criminal justice system to make dispensation of justice simpler, quicker and more effective. it will initiate a mission mode project for filling vacancies in the judiciary and for doubling the number of courts and judges in the subordinate judiciary in a phased manner. the government will give special emphasis to the development of alternate dispute resolution mechanisms., honourable members, 25.on the economic front, we are passing through an extremely difficult phase. for two consecutive years, our gdp growth has been less than 5 per cent. tax collection has declined. inflation continues to be at an unacceptable level. thus, putting the indian economy back on track is paramount for my government. we will work together to usher our economy into a high growth path, rein in inflation, reignite the investment cycle, accelerate job creation and restore the confidence of the domestic as well as international community in our economy., 26.my government will create a policy environment which is predictable, transparent and fair. it will embark on rationalisation and simplification of the tax regime to make it non-adversarial and conducive to investment, enterprise and growth. my government will make every effort to introduce the gst while addressing the concerns of states. reforms will be undertaken to enhance the ease of doing business. my government will follow a policy of encouraging investments, including through fdi; which will be allowed in sectors that help create jobs and assets., 27.for rapid creation of jobs in the manufacturing sector, the government will strategically promote labour-intensive manufacturing. employment opportunities will also be expanded by promoting tourism and agro-based industries. my government will transform employment exchanges into career centres - connecting our youth with job opportunities in a transparent and effective manner through the use of technology as well as through counselling and training. the government will strengthen the pension and health insurance safety nets for labour force of all categories and would provide them access to modern financial services., 28.we need to transform ourselves into a globally competitive manufacturing hub powered by skill, scale and speed. to this end, the government will set up world class investment and industrial regions, particularly along the dedicated freight corridors and industrial corridors spanning the country. my government will encourage the domestic industry to innovate and collaborate internationally. it will strive to move towards a single-window system of clearances both at the centre and at the states through a hub-spoke model., 29.to strengthen our share in global trade, procedures will be simplified and trade infrastructure strengthened so as to reduce transaction time and costs. the ssi and handicraft sectors will be encouraged by providing them enhanced technological, marketing and investment support. export potential of this sector will be encouraged. my government will make every effort to improve the working conditions of our weavers in particular. it will also set up a task force to review and revive our msme sector., honourable members, 30.lack of robust infrastructure is one of india’s major impediments. the government will chalk out an ambitious infrastructure development programme to be implemented in the next 10 years. a fast-track, investment friendly and predictable ppp mechanism will be put in place. modernization and revamping of railways is on top of the infrastructure agenda. my government will launch a diamond quadrilateral project of high speed trains. the country will have a network of freight corridors with specialised agri-rail networks for perishable agricultural products. investment in railways will be increased using innovative financing methods. expansion of railways in hilly states and northeast region and modernization of rail safety systems will be prime focus areas. we will encourage r&d and high level local manufacturing for railway systems. a fast, time-bound and well monitored programme for execution of the national highways programme will be initiated, to overcome the stagnancy of the past few years. low cost airports will be developed to promote air connectivity to smaller towns. the government will evolve a model of port-led development. our long coastline will become the gateway for india’s prosperity. my government will facilitate modernization of existing ports on one hand, and development of new world class ports on the other. stringing together the sagar mala project we will connect the ports with the hinterland through road and rail. inland and coastal waterways will be developed as major transport routes., 31.my government will come out with a comprehensive national energy policy and focus on development of energy related infrastructure, human resource and technology. the aim of the government will be to substantially augment electricity generation capacity through judicious mix of conventional and non-conventional sources. it will expand the national solar mission and connect households and industries with gas-grids. reforms in the coal sector will be pursued with urgency for attracting private investment in a transparent manner. the international civil nuclear agreements will be operationalized and nuclear power projects for civilian purposes will be developed., 32.my government is conscious of the fact that our urban infrastructure is under severe stress. soon, 50 per cent of our population would be residing in urban areas. taking urbanization as an opportunity rather than a challenge, the government will build 100 cities focussed on specialized domains and equipped with world class amenities. integrated infrastructure will be rolled out in model towns to focus on cleanliness and sanitation. by the time the nation completes 75 years of its independence, every family will have a pucca house with water connection, toilet facilities, 24x7 electricity supply and access., honourable members, 33.while putting the country on a high growth path, my government will keep sustainability at the core of our planning process. my government strongly believes that environmental conservation can go hand in hand with development. to achieve this, environment and forest clearance systems will be made more predictable, transparent and time-bound. simultaneously, an effective system will be developed for sound appraisal processes and strict compliance of clearance conditions, especially those relating to rehabilitation of displaced communities and regeneration of forests. cleaner fuels will be promoted to bring down pollution levels in our cities. the government will earnestly take up mitigation works to meet the challenges posed by climate change and will closely work with the global community in this regard. conservation of himalayan ecology will be a priority area for my government. a national mission on himalayas will be launched., 34. in the recent past, serious concerns have been expressed regarding use of discretionary powers in allocation of our precious natural resources. the government will formulate clear and transparent policies on allocation of critical natural resources such as coal, minerals and spectrum., 35.river ganga is a part of our rich cultural heritage, a symbol of faith and the lifeline for millions. however, ganga continues to remain polluted with many stretches of the river becoming dry in lean season. my government will take all necessary steps to ensure a perennial, clean and pristine ganga., 36.our rich cultural heritage is the very foundation on which rests the unity of our diverse nation. indian languages are repositories of our rich literature, history, culture, art and other achievements. my government will launch a national mission “e-bhasha” that will develop digital vernacular content and disseminate our classic literature in different languages. my government will also provide the required resources for the maintenance and restoration of national heritage sites., 37.india has a vast untapped potential for tourism which can play a special role in our socio-economic progress. the government will initiate a mission mode project to create 50 tourist circuits that are built around specific themes. with a view to encouraging pilgrimage tourism, a national mission for beautifying and improving the amenities and infrastructure at pilgrimage centres of all faiths will be launched., 38.my government recognises the central role of science and technology in raising the quality of life. it will encourage and incentivise private sector investments, both domestic and foreign, in science and technology and in high-end research aimed at nurturing innovation. my government will build world class research centres in the fields of nanotechnology, material sciences, thorium technology, brain research, stem cells, etc. the government will also establish institutes of technology for rural development and a central university of himalayan studies., honourable members, 39.the government will maintain utmost vigil in the area of internal security. a policy of zero tolerance towards terrorism, extremism, riots and crime will be pursued. the states will be assisted for modernizing police infrastructure and equipment to tackle new forms of terrorism including narco terrorism and cyber threats. a national plan will be chalked out in consultation with the state governments to effectively curb incidents of communal violence and the challenges posed by left wing extremism. my government will take steps to equip the security forces with the latest technology and to improve their working conditions., 40.my government will carry out reforms in defence procurement to increase efficiency and economy. it will encourage domestic industry, including the private sector; to have a larger share in design and production of defence equipment. we will introduce policies to strengthen technology transfer, including through liberalised fdi in defence production. with readily available skilled human resource, india can emerge as a global platform for defence manufacturing including software, which will strengthen our defence and spur industrial development as well as exports., 41.the country is proud of its armed forces. they serve the nation with professionalism, dedication and valour; securing our nation and supporting relief and rescue operations in the wake of disasters and calamities. we will strengthen defence preparedness by modernising our armed forces and addressing the shortage of manpower on priority. recognising the importance of coastal security, my government will set up a national maritime authority., 42.my government will do everything to repay the debt of our brave and selfless soldiers. it will appoint a veterans commission to address their grievances, so that they know that we don’t stop caring for them when they retire from active service. the government will build a national war memorial to honour the gallantry of our soldiers. one rank, one pension scheme will be implemented., honourable members, 43.india’s foreign policy, with its civilizational roots and heritage, is based on the principles of developing peaceful and friendly relations with all countries. we will pursue our international engagement based on enlightened national interest, combining the strength of our values with pragmatism, leading to a doctrine of mutually beneficial relationships. my government is committed to building a strong, self-reliant and self-confident india; regaining its rightful place in the comity of nations., 44.my government sent a unique and bold signal to the south asian region and the world, by inviting for the first time in independent india, leaders of all south asian neighbours to the swearing-in ceremony of the new council of ministers on may 26. we are grateful to them for accepting the invitation at such a short notice. their participation, as also the gracious presence of the prime minister of mauritius; not only added sheen to the ceremony, but also represented a celebration of democracy in the region and convergence of our shared hopes and aspirations. this shows my government’s commitment and determination to work towards building a peaceful, stable and economically inter-linked neighbourhood which is essential for the collective development and prosperity of the south asian region. we will further work together with south asian leaders to revitalise saarc as an effective instrument for regional cooperation and as a united voice on global issues., 45.at the same time, we will never shy away from raising issues of concern to us at a bilateral level. we emphasize that the future of shared prosperity can only be built on the foundation of stability in the region, which requires sensitivity to security concerns and an end to export of terrorism to neighbours., 46.my government will engage energetically with other neighbours in our region, including china, with whom we will work to further develop our strategic and cooperative partnership. we will strive to make progress in the many initiatives that are ongoing with japan, especially in the field of building modern infrastructure in our country. russia remains a privileged and strategic partner and my government will build further on the firm foundations of this relationship., 47.india and the united states have made significant progress in developing strategic partnership over the years. my government will bring a renewed vigour to our engagement and intensify it in all areas, including trade, investment, science and technology, energy and education. india also values its broad-based cooperation with europe. the government will make concerted efforts to achieve progress in key areas with the european union as well as its leading members., 48.to fully realize our softpower potential; there is a need to integrate it into our external

2014-08-24,commissioning a new plan,"with the announcement of the demise of the planning commission by the prime minister, many obituaries of the commission are being written. however, it is worth remembering that the east asian superstars of development all had planning as a key part of their development programme. south korea had a powerful economic planning board (epb) which guided development programmes in three decades since 1962. china has had a continuum of plans with the xii five year plan going up to 2015. india too simply cannot achieve its development objectives without some sort of planning., it should be clearly understood that a pure market economy is inconsistent with bjp’s much admired vision: sabka vikas, sabke sath. it is also inconsistent with the prime minister’s call in his independence day speech to rise above “me-ism”. votaries of pure market economy emphasize, as the father of modern market economics adam smith did, that markets ensure that individuals taking care of their own interests lead to social good. in that philosophy, there is no need to think of the country or of its development or of the welfare of all. but markets by themselves will not ensure swachha bharat or shauchalaya for women in rural areas. in general, ‘development’ is not market’s business just as business may not be government’s business. if we want development, we need the government’s help and that needs planning of some sort or other. the only question is what the new avatar of planning will look like. let me suggest some features of that new avatar., suggested namelet us begin with the name. i suggest national development commission (ndc), which, while simple, includes all development-related activities such as policy reforms, investment programmes, regulations, social marketing, consensus-building and the like. the alternative that is being bandied about (‘national development and reforms commission’) makes an unnatural distinction between development and reforms. development is the objective; reforms are but one instrument., blueprintthe objective of ndc will be to prepare blueprints, help design action programmes, and monitor and evaluate outcomes to achieve the goal of “sabka vikas, sabke sath”. ndc will define what ‘vikas’ will mean for india of the 21st century. one possible definition could be that india would become a high-income country by 2050 when it celebrates the centenary of the republic. but prosperity will be not just in economic dimension but also social, cultural and spiritual dimensions. in short, the goal will be that india, with the largest number of people in the world in 2050, will also be number one country in the world., in preparing the blueprint for india as no.1, ndc will bring long-term perspectives which are generally missing in operating ministries fighting day-to-day battles. such long-term perspectives are important because in many areas (such as human capital formation) gestation lag is long. similarly, in many areas (such as infrastructure) what we do today will bind us for the next 40-50 years. climate change issues will become serious over a long period but mitigation and adaptation measures have to start now. if we wait for the consequences of climate change to become evident, it will be too late. the second area where ndc will contribute is to take fully into account the connectivity between sectoral programmes. it is well-known that different operating ministries operate as silos (and even jagirs as the prime minister mentioned in his independence day speech) while in real life their operations are connected. for highlighting these links and achieve “optimum utilisation of resources” a central economic agency is needed., co-ordinationndc will be the agency to co-ordinate policy issues where different ministries are working with their own imperatives and mindsets. energy policy, transport policy, urbanisation policy, water policy, land policy all require inter-ministerial co-ordination which only a central agency such as ndc can provide. in addition to preparing national long-term blueprint, ndc will help each state and union territory to prepare its own long-term blueprints. the task will be managed by states and uts but ndc will provide financial and intellectual support as needed., by producing blueprints on which there can be a national consensus, ndc will help in making development a mass movement similar to what was done at the time of freedom struggle. all individuals at different levels will understand what the nation is trying to achieve and how it is in the interest of all and requires support of all. this will help in ensuring that steps of 1.25 billion people are in the same direction and not cancelling each other’s efforts. in the light of nationally agreed long-term blueprints, operating ministries will prepare detailed annual action programmes/budgets in consultation with the ministry of finance and with right to comment by ndc. the prime minister’s office (pmo) will decide in cases of conflicting views., allocation of resourcesthe allocation of financial resources between states and the centre will be the function of the finance commission. however, there would be many central projects (for example, in railways, ports, shipping, education and health) where the allocation of resources by the centre will have an obvious spatial pattern and thus impinge on states’ development. for these expenditure by the centre, ndc will be a forum for ensuring inter-state balance with full participation of the states., monitoring and evaluation of the programmes will be an important function of ndc. this will focus not on auditing functions but on effectiveness and efficiency of the operations in achieving the objectives. ndc will report to pmo for follow-up and necessary actions.",0.120774425995945,commissioning new plan,"announcement demise

2014-09-25,"a faster, cheaper mars orbiter","making history: in the martian marathon, india has reached the finish line ahead of china. picture shows the rocket carrying the mars orbiter lifting off from sriharikota on november 5, 2013. | photo credit: pti , india has created global history by becoming the first asian nation to reach the mars orbit in a space mission. the success is sweeter because this has been done in its maiden attempt. no other country that has attempted a mission to mars has succeeded in reaching the planet on debut. so, the indian space research organisation (isro) can claim that it has done a shade better than accomplished space powers such as the united states and russia in reaching mars., india’s mangalyaan has cost the country rs.450 crore or about $70 million; it is without doubt the cheapest inter-planetary mission ever to be undertaken since martian exploration began. on september 22, a mission by nasa called the mars atmosphere and volatile evolution (maven), made at a cost of over $670 million, reached mars. this indian marathon took 300 days to cover a distance of over 670 million kilometres — a sprint really in a record time of 10 months., the first official hint that india was undertaking a mission to mars came in the budget speech of 2012. subsequently, prime minister manmohan singh formally declared in his independence day speech that year that an indian mission was heading to mars. the mission itself was launched on a balmy afternoon on november 5, 2013, and the journey from the red fort to the red planet has had a dream run., on his last visit to isro, when he witnessed the launch of a polar satellite launch vehicle, prime minister narendra modi said india’s mars orbiter is a “great achievement” since it costs less than the making of the hollywood blockbuster movie “gravity” which had a tag of $100 million., an inexpensive missionmany have questioned why india should be sending a robotic mission to mars when there is so much poverty, malnutrition, death, disaster and diseases among its 1.2 billon population. some have even called this mission as being a part of india’s “delusional dream” of becoming a superpower in the 21st century. there can be nothing farther from the truth. if one analyses the cost of the mars orbiter mission of rs.450 crore, for indians it works out to be about rs.4 per person. today, a bus ride would cost a lot more., india’s mars orbiter mission has paved the way for cheaper and faster inter-planetary probes. during his upcoming u.s. visit, mr. modi and u.s. president barack obama are likely to sign a new agreement for the making of the joint indo-u.s. radar satellite mission. china and india recently signed an agreement on “peaceful uses of outer space.” so, many are now wanting to partner in isro’s success., the mission, within minutes of reaching mars, has already taken its first images of the martian surface. the mars colour camera, which is essentially an indian eye to track mars, will bring back the first tangible truths to indian taxpayers that their money has been well spent., if the 20th century witnessed a “space race” between the u.s. and the ussr, the 21st century is seeing an asian space race. in most aspects of space technology, china is way ahead of india. it has larger rockets, bigger satellites and several rocket ports. it even launched its first astronaut in space way back in 2003 and has a space laboratory in the making., in 2008, when india undertook its first mission to moon chandrayaan-1, china raced ahead and orbited its chang’e-1 satellite ahead of india. but in this martian marathon, india has reached the finish line ahead of china. this now puts india in the pole position as far as asian martian exploration goes. in 2012, the first chinese probe to mars yinghuo-1 failed. it was riding atop a russian satellite called phobos-grunt. but the chinese probe failed to even leave earth. earlier in 1998, a japanese probe to mars ran out of fuel., today, india’s mars orbiter mission has shown that the indian elephant has lumbered ahead of the chinese red dragon. for the record, isro’s chairman dr. k. radhakrishnan has gone on record by saying, “we are not racing with anybody. we are racing with ourselves. we have to race to reach the next level of excellence.”, challenges aheadnow that india has reached mars, isro has several other goals and challenges to meet. coming up in the next few weeks is the test firing of india’s monster rocket, the geosynchronous satellite launch vehicle mk iii, a rocket capable of carrying heavy payloads into space. this flight will carry a dummy crew module, which is part of a programme for the development of critical technologies that isro seeks to develop as part of its human space flight programme., as isro says, the first astronaut could well be a woman. in a few weeks, an indian navigation satellite will be also launched into space. by 2017, isro wants to undertake india’s second mission to moon chandrayaan-2 which will have an indian lander and a rover. subsequently, it also wants to launch dedicated missions to study the sun and the planetary bodies in the solar system., mr. modi, in his stirring speech to isro, spoke of its capabilities and efficiencies. it is an eye-opener that a country which can undertake a mission to mars is unable to provide electricity to 400 million citizens. what is worse is that 600 million indians still don’t have access to toilets. it is hoped that mr. modi would have learnt a lesson or two from the indian space agency on how to undertake cost-effective projects with no time or cost overruns. if only mr. modi internalises this big learning can his dream of having “swachh bharat” by 2019 become a reality.",0.06676136363636365,"faster , cheaper mars orbiter","making history : martian marathon , india reached finish line ahead china. picture shows rocket carrying mars orbiter lifting

2014-10-11,private cleanliness amid public squalor,"after my sister’s death some years ago, i had carried her ashes for immersion in the kosi river, an insignificant mountain tributary of the ganga. i wanted an unsullied bit of water for a religious ceremony, and so chose a secluded stretch of the river in uttarakhand near ranikhet. but despite the remoteness, the water and its sand bed was littered with plastic, toothpaste tubes and instant noodle packets. and as the ceremony progressed, i noticed upstream from us a group of men defecating and chatting on the river rocks., it is no secret that india has the largest number of people defecating in the open, even when a toilet is available. whether a rivulet along a sloped hillside in a pristine himalayan valley, a river coursing through a city, or indeed along a coastal beach, water is as much an invitation to drink as it is to excrement. even the ganga functions at two levels: as religious sanctuary and india’s largest open air sewer., wherever you go — in city or countryside — plastic bags, tetra paks and tin cans mar the landscape. in slum areas and industrial townships, rivulets of slime snake along mud tenements. in cities, garbage overwhelms all sightlines (i recently saw a group of japanese tourists photographing ragpickers foraging in raw sewage, next to the monument they had come to see). just as the mughals had decorated gateways around their settlements, entrances to indian towns today are rife with a new 21st century sign of welcome: mountains of trash. as humans, pigs and vultures battle among the waste, there hangs over most places, a perpetual stench of decay and death., for prime minister narendra modi’s “clean india” campaign, a rs.2 lakh crore expenditure is envisaged by the government to clean the country by october 2, 2019, a date to be celebrated as the 150th birth anniversary of mahatma gandhi. part of the money is intended for drinking water and sanitation programmes and the rest for the physical clean up of indian cities. but, so acute is the problem of waste, it is hard to believe that the mission can be anything more than a symbolic act., moreover, the indian public has infinite tolerance for hackneyed political gestures — planting saplings, visiting rajghat, laying foundation stones, conducting pujas for newly built flyovers. “swachh bharat” too, say critics, will only remain afloat in the big cities, till such time as the prime minister’s greater interest in business matters relegates it to the dung heap. the project’s farcical dimension can already be seen in the surprise inspections of government offices, and the large quantum of brooms and dustbins ordered by bureaucrats and ministers, some departments going into direct competition with each other by issuing instruction handbooks on cleanliness., that the prime minister of a country needs to intervene on an issue as basic as public health is of course the first serious admission that the problem is way out of hand. on the world stage, india is already acknowledged as one of the dirtiest and least liveable countries in the world. in a recent survey of the liveability index of 150 world cities, delhi, mumbai and other indian metros were all listed below 130, only ahead of some west african cities. (ironically, the same survey listed delhi as the most desirable city among the indian low performers.) chief among the criterion of liveability was health and sanitation, though other related conditions such as infrastructure, parks and accessibility were also spelled out., indian cities took a beating on the most rudimentary aspects of survival, and were classified more as unplanned spontaneous slums than functioning towns, with some of the highest recorded levels of toxic waste, and consequently, physical sickness. incidents of asthma and lung infection linked directly to pollution were steadily on the rise. in most metros it was stated as 12 times the national average, and almost a third of the population suffered some form of respiratory illness; the survey also gave damning figures on waterborne diseases, and reduced eyesight, impaired mental acuity and shorter lifespans., in most countries, public health and sanitation are taken for granted and fall squarely on urban administration. so basic are norms of healthy urban living around the world, they rarely ever make it as news items. only in india do routine municipal issues assume national importance. blocked drains during monsoons, road repair, malarial and dengue outbreaks, raw sewage on sidewalks, children stuck in wells, open manholes, fallen trees and collapsing buildings are all signs of a disintegrating collective life. when municipal authorities fail to oversee ordinary maintenance and are incapable of undertaking decisions on day-to-day governance, the city becomes a nightmare of incompetence and failed ideas, regressing quickly into anarchy — a battleground so scarred that the rich can only isolate themselves into private compounds, creating their own insular lives unrelated to the city; the poor are left to their own devices, living in the ruin and seeking business opportunity in the squalor and clutter. the prime minister’s cleanliness campaign is merely the fallout of complete municipal collapse., while credit is certainly due to mr. modi for initiating the much needed push to make the country a physically healthier place, the larger thrust of the nationwide mission needs to take into account other ideas that indirectly contribute to civic grime. cars physically choke city space, parking on sidewalks, covering up and clogging drainage systems; building materials for private construction are allowed to pile up on roads, parks are shuttered, security threatened. cleanliness is only a small fraction of the larger aspect of urban liveability; if the prime minister’s mission is to succeed it must tackle the dangers of increasing urban densities, issues of public safety, misuse of public land for private use, encroachments, aspects of public transport and limits to car ownership, the removal of gated communities;

2014-10-15,for a swachh bharatiya rail,"unsightly: garbage attracts rodents. picture shows a station in chennai.— photo: r. ragu | photo credit: r_ragu , imagine being bitten by a rat, not once but twice! that is what happened recently to a person travelling in a train to chennai. the passenger, rather than reacting hysterically, calmly squeezed the bite wound, before complaining to the railway authorities and seeking medical aid. the local railway authorities, while expressing regret, told the passenger that the rake (train formation) is maintained at mumbai, implying that the responsibility for the presence of the pesky rodent lay elsewhere., now, why should a rat be found in a train? to be sure, >railways and rats (and bandicoots and mice) have had a long association going back almost to the advent of the railways in india in the mid-nineteenth century. but while in the past, rats and their kindred species were largely confined to goods sheds, parcel offices and occasionally got sucked into train vacuum pipes (now thankfully defunct with the advent of airbrakes), now they have become frequent travellers in reserved and ac coaches. the average passenger is wont to attribute this to the utter negligence, callousness, and inefficiency of a government-run monopoly. however such a conclusion would be simplistic and hasty., ideal environment for rats some of the major train maintenance centres like the one in chennai are located in the midst of thickly populated urban agglomerations. these are not enclosed or restricted spaces but open yards. because of the washing and wet cleaning of the train formations, the inspection pits and surrounding areas are usually damp. discarded food and waste matter including human excrement expelled from train formations coming in for maintenance add to the problem. this makes an ideal environment for rats, cockroaches and the like to breed. pest control measures can at best be in the nature of a holding action. the current antiquated system of open yards is a carry over of a bygone era. unfortunately, this aspect has never received the attention it has deserved., the answer obviously is to have totally sanitised and covered state-of-the-art maintenance centres that can accommodate train formations of 24 or 26 coaches, with strict access control, totally dry inspection pits, and other facilities apart from separate washing bays with waste water reclamation. with the progressive introduction of modern designs of toilets, direct discharge of human waste to the outside can be avoided., this is not some utopian scenario; what is suggested above are exactly the type of facilities that will be set up for the maintenance of the much-hyped bullet trains. there is no reason, therefore, why over the next decade or so similar facilities should not be set up, at least in major urban centres, to service trains used by the aam aadmi. but even with such improved facilities, due to the steady increase in the number of trains each year, stabling of train formations out in the open cannot be totally avoided. this entails keeping the yards also in a reasonable state of cleanliness, free of litter and unwanted vegetation., the indian attitude, ‘it is my privilege to litter, your duty to clean’, has to go , further, with the intensive utilisation of train formations, they are often kept on station platforms for a long time and turned back after “dry” cleaning, with some unintended benefits for the rodent population. for railway stations are the other major centres for the proliferation of rodents and other pests. there are two reasons for this: first, the easy availability of edible garbage and second, the plentiful supply of perishables such as fish on the platforms. indian railways must perhaps be the only major railway system in the world where fare-paying passengers have to jostle for space with huge mounds of parcels scattered on the platforms of all major stations. this tyranny of the parcels is bound to continue unless there is complete segregation of parcels and passenger traffic. studies have been conducted in the past towards this end, but no tangible progress has been achieved., the >swachh bharat abhiyaan, launched by prime minister narendra modi, has rightly emphasised cleanliness as a goal. it is high time, therefore, that attention is directed towards setting right the infrastructural shortcomings that contribute directly to insanitary conditions in railway premises and trains. while the images of ministers and senior officials posing with the broom may provide smart photo-ops, it will take more than the broom to clean up the railways., with more than 12,600 trains carrying 23 million passengers every day, indian railways must be that unique institution in the country that generates the largest volume and variety of garbage (including human waste) rivalling many large towns. to expect this huge volume of trash to be dealt with by an army of cleaning staff with brooms and such implements is to totally misjudge the nature and scale of the problem., comparisons are frequently drawn between the spotless premises and train interiors of railway systems abroad and the woeful condition of trains and stations in india. what is blithely overlooked is the fact that in those countries all public spaces, not only trains and stations, are generally litter-free, not because they employ an army of safaiwallas with brooms but because of the innate civic sense of the citizens. this is not an excuse for railway premises and trains being dirty or being infested with rats, cockroaches and the like. but while there are internal issues such as upgrading of maintenance facilities and segregation of parcel traffic involving heavy investments that the railways themselves have to deal with, an equally important input is the positive contribution that the millions of railway users can make in ensuring a clean, litter-free environment. the attitude “it is my privilege to litter, your duty to clean” has to go.",0.08282748501498502,swachh bharatiya rail,"unsightly : garbage attracts rodents. picture shows station chennai. — photo : r. ragu &#124;

2014-11-01,recalibrating india’s foreign policy,"indian border security force (bsf) soldiers patroling near the line of control (loc). | photo credit: mukesh gupta , prime minister narendra modi has now interacted with the leaders of four of the five countries/regions — saarc, china, japan, russia, and u.s. — on the list of foreign policy priorities mentioned in the president’s address to the opening session of parliament. it is, therefore, an appropriate time to take stock of the underlying changes in the directions of india’s foreign policy. in other words, is mr. modi’s foreign policy likely to differ from that of sonia gandhi-manmohan singh?, every country’s foreign policy has elements of continuity and change following a change in government. india’s policy under mr. modi is no different. the changes have not necessarily been explicitly articulated, but are implicit in the government’s actions and view of the world., there are five areas of the emerging change: the centrality given to economic and technological development; the orientation of domestic and foreign policies toward this objective; the emphasis on national power including military power; and stress on soft power; and a reduction in self-imposed constraints on actions that other countries may construe as inimical to their interests., changes in foreign policy the first change in foreign policy relates to the greater attention provided to economic objectives. this is not a mere reiteration of the economic development objective that has been india’s mantra since independence but recognition of the role of technology (broadly defined) in all aspects of economic development. this involves an implicit benchmarking of the technological capabilities of the indian economy with the global best practices; having a perception of the gaps; and setting the goal of bridging these gaps., the government’s divergence from the policies of the previous regimes is reflected in two initiatives, the swachh bharat abhiyan and the digital india campaign, both of which involve the use of appropriate technology., “aggression along the border is being countered by bold moves like the decision to construct a ‘mcmahon highway’ in arunachal pradesh”, this is probably the first time that an indian prime minister has explained india’s economic and technological objectives abroad — ‘india first’; has identified the specific role each country could play in achieving these objectives — for instance u.s. and japan; and has made that the centrepiece of his discussion with the leaders of that country. ‘india first’ means that india’s requirements — when it comes to various areas like basic sanitation, defence and space technology — will be expressed with greater clarity and specificity to other countries., the second change relates to a much greater orientation of domestic and foreign policies toward those objectives. the indian prime minister has been very explicit about indian objectives with respect to economic development and technological catch-up and in exploring how domestic and international policies will be used to close the gaps across the entire spectrum. its decisions will then be based on a cost-benefit analysis on a defined set of parameters, not on ideological considerations like that of non-alignment., the third change is with respect to a greater emphasis on overall national power — recognising that economic power is its foundation, but also giving a greater role to military power., the modi government appreciates that economic power cannot be a substitute for military power in deterring aggression from the ideologically driven foes. on the contrary, economic assistance can be viewed by military ideologues as an expression of superiority to be resented. economic relations can complement international security relationships by influencing the behaviour of non-ideological, economically rational players in the global system but only military strength can deter militaristic ideologues and ensure peace., operationally, this has two important implications. one is a clearer appreciation of all the dimensions of external threat, particularly unconventional threats. this requires a build-up of world-class equipment and skills over a much wider spectrum of warfare and covert capabilities and a willingness to boldly attack the aggressor in his safe havens. this is already happening both in terms of enhancing capabilities in counter-terrorism and in defence against non-state actors; and, more importantly, in doctrines incorporating a willingness to take calculated risks in using asymmetric capabilities., on deterrence deterrence is however only effective if the adversary is convinced that the new government will respond to asymmetric warfare with appropriate action spread across a much broader spectrum of conventional and unconventional options. when diplomatic moves sent to our western neighbour, like the track-2 dialogue, did not have any impact on ‘deep state’, it became necessary to bring about a change in the overall strategy through a heightened conventional response to border firing/ceasefire violations., similarly, unconventional psychological warfare and ‘creeping annexation’ tactics along the northern border are being countered by bolder plans — like the decision to construct a ‘mcmahon highway’ along lac in arunachal — that have both conventional and symbolic components., the second implication is a much greater focus on national capability to produce a broad range of defence equipment in india. ‘self-sufficiency’ has been a slogan from the days of nehruvian socialism, but it played second fiddle to the ideological goal of preserving public sector’s monopoly over the means of (defence) production. this is being decisively broken., the ability and willingness to transfer technology and help build skills and research capabilities at lower costs will consequently play a much more important role in our relations with japan, russia, u.s. and eu countries. this reinvigorated approach to national security is likely to manifest itself in a reversal of the trend of decline in ratio of defence expenditures to gdp., the fourth change is a greater emphasis on ‘soft power’. mr. modi’s speech to the indian diaspora in new york was a successful attempt to inspire them to contribute to the country’s economic and technological development., the fifth change is a freeing up of self-imposed, historical and mental constraints on developing the relationship with any country to its full potential. thus, india’s economic relationship with potential adversaries can be independent of its security relationship. this is reflected in developments like the economic agreements reached between mr. modi and chinese president xi jingping, the formation of the brics bank and aiib (asian infrastructure investment bank). further, the relationship with one country will not constrain that with others — cooperation with china will not affect that with japan. both will be evaluated in terms of india’s objectives of building national power., pragmatic reset of policy mr. modi’s pragmatic reset of policy toward the u.s. reflects this change in overall approach. the u.s. is still the sole superpower and stands head and shoulders above others in the depth and breadth of its strategic and defence technology. it is also a major source of technology, capital and export markets for the indian private sector., there are, however, inherent differences in perspective between a rich global power and a poor regional one: u.s. is a net exporter of technology with high per-capita pollution while india is a net technology importer with high incremental pollution., a pragmatic approach seems to be emerging to resolving these differences and to minimise the negative fallout of unresolved differences and focus on areas of convergence like counter-terrorism and maritime security in and around the indian ocean.",0.10667940392940392,recalibrating india ’ foreign policy,"indian border security force ( bsf ) soldiers patroling near line control ( loc ) . &#124;

2014-11-01,look back at kamal,"""films just don’t feel like work any more. they remind me of the time i used to build pyramids with playing cards when i was a child."" photo: s. r. raghunathan , sixty. does it seem like a milestone that forces you to look back at the journey you’ve taken?, well, it’s definitely no surprise that i am turning 60. the fact that i’ve lived this long is not really an achievement. time passes, we age… it’s natural. this is why it annoys me when a person watches a movie and tells me that it was ‘time pass’. would time not have passed if he hadn’t watched the film? but yes, i do throw glances at what i’ve done; i take stock of my inventory, so to speak. i think i’ve managed to retain my honesty, and while i don’t agree that it’s a great policy as the adage goes, i believe that it’s a luxury that only few people can afford., on your birthday, you’re encouraging your fan club to clean a lake in taramani., there are civic issues that bother me. my road (eldam’s road), for example, has been laid and relaid over and over again. as a boy who looked out of the window at this road, i can, with confidence, tell you that the road has ascended several feet. why is the road not scraped before a new one is laid? i’m talking about these issues, as swachh bharat seems to be quite the trend now., some people believe that for change to occur, the people who seek it must participate in governance. with your fan base, politics must seem an interesting prospect., would i get into politics? i’ll just say what i tell people when they ask me this. pray that everyday citizens like me aren’t pushed to that corner. i’m happy doing my bit in the background with my supporters. we have been doing useful work for 30 years., in fact, one of the most memorable photographs of my life was one in which a member of my ‘narpani iyakkam’ stood waist-deep in a sink hole to clean drainage. he did that, expecting nothing in return., is it scary that there are admirers who’re willing to do anything?, yes. that’s why i changed the fan club to a ‘narpani iyakkam’. in fact, when the late mgr asked me if i was interested in politics, i asked him instead for suggestions on how to make my group apolitical., you wrote both vishwaroopam 2 and uttama villain. in an interview, you have said you’re grateful that filmmakers like r. c. sakthi encouraged you to write., yes! i wish i could be equally encouraging of shruti (shruti haasan). i think she writes a lot better than i do. perhaps she will read this interview and get motivated to write more., what else do you write?, i write the occasional poem. i think my dabbling in poetry makes me better at screenplays. poetry teaches the value of condensing, the importance of talking in a few words. so, yes, i do write poetry even though i’m asked not to publish them., too controversial?, i wrote one ten years back about the onset of gay marriages. so, you can imagine., despite your confessed reluctance to act, you chose to do so., people keep saying balachander discovered me. i differ. he invented me. when a stalwart like him suggests that i act in films, who am i to refuse?, what do you make of the kind of films you’re working on today?, well, it’s clear that i’m scared and i’m playing the market. i’m not as free as an art filmmaker and that’s fine because i want to take people towards that destination eventually. the journey is more important, and when i die, i want to do so knowing that i’ve led some people forward. that said, i’d really like to make a film like terrence malick’s the tree of life. before all that, let me make the usual films without the fear of them being banned., from virumaandi to vishwaroopam, your films have met with quite some backlash, haven’t they?, being offended is one thing, breaking glass is another. if somebody misrepresented a reality i relate to, i’d probably be offended by it, but i wouldn’t resort to violence or fundamentalist measures., going back to writing, i see that many directors prefer to do the writing themselves. why’s this?, i had a conversation with karunanidhi once, when he asked me why i was keeping him waiting for so long before each release. i told him, “ezhudha therinjavanga illa sir.” he replied, “therinju ezhudharavan illanu sollunga.” i don’t think we have enough trained screenwriters here., surely, there are tamil novelists who can step in?, i was responsible for bringing in people like the late sujatha into the industry. however, most writers are sceptical of film people, i think. it’s just a different medium., a progressive film like aval appadithan was made in 1978. do you believe we have grown since then?, we have regressed really. i’m not sure what is causing this decline. it’s perhaps the mass influx of untrained people into the industry because of the success of filmmakers like bharathiraja and ilaiyaraaja. aval appadithan was a guerilla attack on the industry by insiders like me. it slipped through their fingers, so to speak. with all the attention that films get these days, i doubt we can get away with such a film any more., people think bharathiraja and ilaiyaraaja just came from their villages and became legends here. they don’t know the training and hard work they had to put in to get where they are today. when we were making raja paarvai, ilaiyaraaja would often request to be excused in the evening. i initially thought he probably wanted some sleep. later, i came to know that he was taking classes in classical music in the evenings. it is such dedication to learning that gets you to the top., so, you believe that the regression is caused mainly by untrained filmmakers?, sure. when i met the late director balu mahendra, i was encouraged by his education at the pune film institute. i asked him if i should join too, and he said i should. however, i learned then that high school dropouts like myself would not be allowed to train there. but at least, during the days that i stepped into films, we had the excuse of not having any training centres in filmmaking. today, there’s just no excuse., for perhaps the first time in decades, you have three films waiting for release., it’s a strange phenomenon. i was worried about the fate of vishwaroopam 2 after what happened to its predecessor. so, instead of waiting for its release, i moved on to uttama villain after lingusamy and i spoke. i also agreed to do papanasam, as it seemed like an interesting film., shooting for these films is over. in fact, shooting for vishwaroopam 2 was over last october except for one song. production delays have kept it waiting. clearly, you can do as many pujas as you want when launching a film, but its fate ultimately isn’t decided by supernatural entities., you are an atheist, are you not? it’s interesting that you ended dasavatharam with ‘kadavul irundha nalla irukkum’ (it’d be a good thing if god existed)?, let me just say i can exist without god; i cannot exist without people. the line was a compromise in a way. i believe that the true saints are those working in places like cern. a person like peter higgs should probably be canonised by the vatican. those are the saints i worship.",0.16762274645186032,look back kamal,""" films ’ feel like work more. remind time used build pyramids playing cards child.

2014-11-01,when the girls came marching in,"on teachers’ day (september 5), the prime minister of india decided to be the ‘teacher of teachers’ and addressed students across the country. on gandhi jayanti (october 2), he repackaged the legacy of and invoked ‘the father of the nation’. netas and babus across the country suddenly became conscious of the need for swachhata (hygiene) and started sweeping streets; with each stroke of the broom choreographed for cameras and reporters. school children were brought out in rallies, parroting slogans they hardly comprehended. , so when on october 2, the residents and shopkeepers in bhim, rajasthan, heard schoolgirls shouting slogans, they paid little attention. they thought it was another swachhata rally. but, as the words became clearer and the rally was sighted, people were drawn out of their homes and shops by the palpable difference: this was a real protest march., about 500 girls, in neat uniforms, marched down the street, holding a banner and placards, enthusiastically shouting slogans. they were not instigated by any political leader or group, and their demand was simple and straightforward: to appoint teachers in their school as per government norms. by the time they went through the town, they had gained people’s sympathy and support; an unusual and important form of civil disobedience had begun., raajakiya balika ucha madhyamik vidhyalay (government girls’ higher secondary school, bhim) is located in the heart of bhim, a small dusty town in rajsamand district, rajasthan. about 700 girls, from std. ix to xii study there, but the number of teaching staff is just three. the principal’s post has been vacant for eight years and one teacher is the acting principal. there is no teacher for basic subjects like mathematics, science, history, geography, hindi and sanskrit. the 11 first grade teacher posts have been vacant since the school was upgraded around 10 years ago. repeated petitions to authorities have gone unanswered though the school is just a stone’s throw away from the block development office (bdo)., since the children of most public officials study in private schools, the government schools’ poor condition and the future of their students does not affect the officials personally. many of the government school students come from very poor families. they travel around 15-20 km to school and spend around rs.20 on daily transport., feeling frustrated and helpless, on the eve of gandhi jayanti, a few students sought the help of shankar singh, a senior activist of the mazdoor kisan shakti sangathan (mkss) in bhim. he tried to persuade them to get their parents to petition the government authorities and begin a dialogue. but the students knew that since most of their parents were daily wage workers, they would not be able to leave their work and begin a dialogue with a set of intimidating officials — the results of which they were sceptical about in any case. so, the students successfully convinced shankar singh and the mkss to provide guidance and moral support., they planned to organise a peaceful rally the next day and submit a memorandum to the block development officer demanding immediate action to appoint teachers. , on october 2, around 450 girls locked the school gate and put up a banner — ‘700 students, 3 teachers; fill up the vacancies now’ — across it. a memorandum was prepared and signatures of all the students obtained. before beginning the rally, the students gathered at the school gate and raised slogans: ‘shiksha hamara adhikar, adhyapak do sarkar’ (education is our right! oh government appoint the teachers for us), ‘padhne wale 700 hain, padhanewale 3 hain” (we are 700 but only three to teach us), and ‘shiksha ka adhikar diya padhane wale koi nahin’ (you gave us the right to education but no one to teach us)., the slogans were innovative and striking, the girls disciplined and determined. the authorities tried to dissuade them. the police told them that they would ruin their padhai (education). the girls retorted, “what padhai is there to be ruined?, the rally route was chosen to reach out to the residents. the students marched on the busy market streets shouting slogans as they went along ‘hindi wala koi nahi, itihas wala koi nahi, ganith wala koi nahi’ (no one to teach hindi/history/maths…). they did not obstruct traffic as they marched in two lines holding the banner in the front. after covering the market, they entered the national highway (nh 8, delhi–mumbai). once the police saw the rally’s peaceful nature, they did not try to stop it but concentrated on managing the traffic., the rally reached the block development officer’s office around 11.30 a.m. the bdo was not there, and the tehsildar and other functionaries came out of their office. they were surprised by the girls’ numbers, confidence and discipline. the students sat on dharna on the road in front of the office, braving the blistering sun. three girls spoke on behalf of the others and explicitly and fearlessly articulated their problems in the presence of government officials, their three teachers, the media, and the general public. they demanded the government respond immediately by appointing teachers; at least one each for every main subject. asserting that they would not be content with ‘empty promises’, they insisted on a time frame. a large and increasingly sympathetic crowd had gathered outside the block office. the government could not afford to ignore them anymore., officials spoke to the students, trying to soothe their nerves. the tehsildar said that he sincerely empathised with them and would do everything possible to find an immediate solution. but the students interrupted by asking him to announce the dates by which teachers would be appointed. meanwhile, the officer ‘in charge of education’, spoke to the district collector and promised that a geography teacher would be appointed immediately. his excuse of an acute shortage of qualified teaching staff in the state was met with an angry outburst: “there are enough teaching staff at every boys’ school, but the government is ignoring our voice since we are girls.” realising that the girls would not relent, the officer promised that mathematics and hindi teachers would be appointed within a week. the students made it clear that if teachers were not appointed by october 7, they would again lock the school gate, and flock to the bdo’s office. , by october 7, no teachers were appointed. on october 8, the girls locked the school gate and sat outside in the sun refusing to accept assurances and open the gates. when accused of disrupting classes, they set up a tent to hold special classes every day outside the school, in full sight of all the offices. at lunch time, some shopkeepers brought them biscuits and snacks, and the pressure on the administration and the education department grew. messages were sent to the collector, the state government, and even the chief minister’s office., as school hours drew to a close, the girls told the bdo that they would conduct classes outside the gate until the promised teachers were appointed. the administration informed them that the orders had been issued and that before the girls came the next morning, four new teachers would report to school. the next morning, the girls saw seven teachers in their assembly.",0.07216565456148788,girls came marching,"teachers ’ day ( september 5 ) , prime minister india decided ‘teacher teachers ’ addressed students across country. gandhi jayanti ( october 2 ) , repackaged legacy invoked ‘the father nation ’ . netas babus across country suddenly became conscious need swachhata ( hygiene ) started sweeping streets ;

2015-02-19,evidence matters to policymaking,"reality check: “evidence shows that just opening bank accounts in someone’s name, as the jan dhan programme is doing, doesn’t work towards achieving the goal of financial inclusion.” prime minister narendra modi at the launch of pradhan mantri jan dhan yojana in new delhi. | photo credit: pti , governments in india have always launched big-ticket social development programmes with ambitious goals. the narendra modi government is no exception. >swachh bharat abhiyan aims to make india open defecation-free by 2019. the pradhan mantri jan dhan yojana’s financial inclusion programme set a target of opening 10 crore bank accounts by january 26, 2015. but are ambitious targets enough for achieving desired outcomes on the ground?, most governments across the world run social development programmes that focus on increasing supply. so, the emphasis is on building toilets, creating bank accounts, providing loans and so on. for politicians, development needs to be visible for it to count as an achievement. it is harder to assess if these programmes are really achieving the results that matter and whether they are improving the lives of the poor. the focus on supply, while ignoring demand, is an approach that has often failed. for example, will toilets be used if they are built? the ministry of drinking water and sanitation is now asking people to post pictures of unused toilets on its website. low usage of toilets is clearly an issue. are the toilets that are being built improving sanitation and child health by reducing diarrhoea — a highly preventable condition that is the leading cause of death of children under five? the answers to these questions are not forthcoming. nor can they be without rigorous evaluations., need for evaluations flagship development programmes in india have not been designed or modified based on evidence from evaluations. there has been a continuity of some social programmes over decades, although governments may have given them different names and made a few changes in design. >swachh bharat abhiyan builds on nirmal bharat abhiyan (2012), the total sanitation campaign (1999) and the central rural sanitation programme (1986). but politics rather than evidence is the key driver for programmes getting closed, changed or renamed., synthesised evidence from impact evaluations of water and sanitation programmes in low and middle-income countries shows that building toilets is not enough for improving sanitation. an impact evaluation of the total sanitation campaign in odisha in 2010 showed that demand-oriented programmes raised latrine use from just six per cent to 35 per cent. this seems like a useful increase, but not one that made any difference to people’s health, and left 65 per cent still not using the new facility. a more recent 3ie-supported impact evaluation in odisha also showed a substantial increase in latrine coverage at the village level. but this increase was also insufficient to reduce child diarrhoea, most likely because the villages in the study were not open defecation-free. it is well established that open defecation supports various transmission channels by which children consume faecal matter: direct contact or indirectly from pets or other animals, and through flies crawling on both excrement and the food children may eat. according to the world health organization and unicef, diarrhoea causes the deaths of more than 7,50,000 children under the age of five every year. a study published in the lancet in 2012 reports that in india alone, an average of 2, 12,000 children under the age of five die of diarrhoea every year., global evaluation evidence on sanitation interventions highlights the need to emphasise behavioural factors for promoting the use and sustained adoption of water, sanitation and hygiene technologies. making people pay even a very small fee has put them off from using water treatment technologies. changing behaviour can take years and decades. sanitation programmes in india need to take this evidence into account., evidence in financial inclusion in the same vein, financial inclusion programmes also need to consider evaluation evidence. according to a 2014 report brought out jointly by the world bank, the better than cash alliance and the bill & melinda gates foundation, over 2.5 billion adults around the world are ‘unbanked’. evidence shows that just opening bank accounts in someone’s name, as the jan dhan programme is doing, doesn’t work. many people don’t even access the account to take out the initial deposit placed there for them. jan dhan’s goal of opening accounts for 10 crore poor people is not enough by itself. there are many reasons people don’t use bank accounts: lack of trust in financial institutions, distance to the bank, illiteracy and reliance on informal and traditional banking sources. in addition to tackling these issues, there may be a need for complementary activities to ensure that the poor can benefit from having bank accounts., “plenty of inspiration can be found for evidence-based policymaking from latin american countries such as mexico, which is known for its system of evaluating social programmes”, the challenge for the modi government now is to evaluate what works in development programming before making large spending decisions. this would mean putting in place rigorous evaluations of the new programmes it is launching. existing programmes need to also be evaluated before major decisions are made about their future. building a culture of evidence-informed policymaking would also require moving towards institutionalising evaluation within government., randomised controlled trials there is plenty of inspiration that can be found for this from other countries, particularly those in latin america. mexico is widely known in the international development community for its system of evaluating social programmes. in the mid-90s, the mexican government launched progresa, one of the world’s first conditional cash transfer programmes. progresa handed out cash to poor families on the condition that they send their children to school and young mothers seek antenatal care. giving cash directly to the poor was not the only innovative aspect of progresa. the government put in place a rigorous randomised evaluation of the programme. just as clinical trials have informed evidence-based medicine, randomised controlled trials of social programmes provide rigorous evidence of whether programmes are working or not.",0.03621850371850372,evidence matters policymaking,"reality check : “evidence shows opening bank accounts someone ’ name , jan dhan programme , ’ work towards achieving

this collaborative effort is the reform in the process of appointment of judges to the high courts and supreme court and the legislation to set up national judicial appointments commission. the government is also committed to repeal the obsolete and redundant laws. a committee constituted for this purpose has identified 1741 central acts for repeal under various categories., 21. maximum governance minimum government is the guiding principle of my government. with an aim to take governance to the doorstep of the poorest of the poor in remotest areas, focus is on simplification of official procedures and reducing the decision-making levels in government by leveraging technology. the system of group of ministers has been dispensed with and emphasis is on swift decision-making. while introducing stricter and sterner measures to deal with corruption; effort is being made to ensure that sufficient safeguards are in place to protect bona fide decisions taken in public interest and to inspire confidence in the civil service., 22. my government is firmly committed to engage people in the process of governance and policy-making. my gov online platform, a path breaking

enormous difference. measures are being taken to accomplish digital inclusion in rural areas, small towns, north-east and other remote areas, opening up immense job opportunities in these areas. promoting manufacturing of electronic goods has been an area of thrust., 24. my government is pledged to decentralization of power and as an important step in this direction, the planning commission has been replaced with a new body-the national institution for transforming india -niti aayog. the underlying spirit of niti aayog is to foster the spirit of cooperative federalism so that union and state governments come on a platform to forge a common national agenda for development, with thrust on empowering the impoverished., honourable members,, 25. as a result of my government’s sustained efforts and series of policy initiatives, our economy is again on the high growth trajectory. according to the latest estimates, our gdp is growing at 7.4%, which makes india the fastest growing large economy in the world. inflation and food inflation, in particular, are at a record low due to a number of decisive measures taken by the government. fixed capital formation, which faced a near stagnation in the last few years, has increased. capital markets are upbeat. our external sector is now far more resilient, particularly with a moderate current account deficit and a broadly stable rupee. our foreign exchange reserves have been substantially augmented., 26. while my government has intensified efforts to bring greater efficiency and equity into the tax system, prudence in expenditure management is also high on the agenda of my government. a constitutional (amendment) bill has been introduced to bring in goods and services tax that will simplify the indirect tax regime, broaden the tax base and result in better tax compliance., honourable members,, 27. my government is committed to taking all possible measures to stop generation of black money, both domestically and internationally. these measures include putting in place robust legislative and administrative frameworks, systems and process with due focus on capacity building, integration of information through technology, and fast tracking prosecution., 28. financial sector institutional restructuring is a priority area. my government will expedite implementation of the recommendations of the financial sector legislative reforms commission. sebi’s new foreign portfolio investment regulations have established a unified, simple regulatory framework. the insurance laws (amendment) ordinance, 2014 was

focus is on technology upgradation, better financial access and market linkages to msme units., 32. textiles sector is the second largest employer after agriculture, providing direct employment to over 4.5 crore people. the sector also contributes one seventh of industrial production and brings more than one fourth of country’s foreign exchange inflows. the growth and all round development of this sector has a direct bearing on the improvement of our economy, particularly the poor artisans. recent initiatives like setting up of trade facilitation centres in different parts of india, bringing textile marketing on-line, incentives for technical textiles, promotion of pashmina, special focus on increasing the coverage in north-eastern part of the country would lead to advancement of this sector., honourable members,, 33. cities are the engines of economic growth. my government is committed to building modern amenities and infrastructure in our urban areas. the national urban

a prudent policy in national interest. the ethanol policy has been revised to promote use of ethanol in petrol and help sugarcane farmers., 40. my government is committed to optimum utilization and transparency in allocation of natural resources. the process for auction of coal blocks has been started in a manner which will reduce the power costs in the country, provide adequate fuel to increase power generation, enhance production of steel, cement, aluminium and other essential materials. this will also provide huge resources from allotment of mines to the mineral and coal bearing states particularly in eastern areas for accelerated development of the region. the swift and timely action taken by my government in this regard prevented the closure of mines which otherwise would have rendered thousands jobless. in coming years, my government would make focussed efforts to expand exploration capacity and to increase domestic coal production to 1000 mtpa., honourable members,, 41.

paramilitary forces for the outstanding service rendered during the relief operations to flood affected people in jammu & kashmir., 47. a high state of disaster preparedness is the key to contain loss

odisha together with the central government., 48. my government is committed to implement the idea of smart police (smart but sensitive, modern and mobile, alert and accountable, reliable and

2015-05-17,it’s not so green within the ghmc limits,"having lost its sheen as a clean and green city, the city is now gearing up for the massive swachh hyderabad initiative with grand plans aimed at improving sanitation and amenities., however, those at the helm of affairs in the greater hyderabad municipal corporation (ghmc) point out that the civic body, which is primarily responsible for keeping the city clean, has not been able to effectively cope with the increasing demand for sanitation in the widening city limits., neither was the required manpower added nor was the fleet of vehicles equipped to handle the sanitation needs of the city, which ended up denting its clean image., an estimated 4,000 metric tonne of garbage and waste gets generated daily in the ghmc jurisdiction. “it is estimated about eight per cent of this is taken away by rag pickers and others which leaves the rest to the civic body to manage,” informed an official, on condition of anonymity., the ghmc figures suggest that 3,300 mt is lifted every day using a workforce of around 23,000 in different aspects – from sweeping streets to collection and shifting to the dump yard at jawaharnagar. the workforce includes approximately 3,000 men and women who are civic body employees. “at one time, there were more than 6,000 workers and the number dropped with retirements and no fresh intake,” another official said, also preferring not to be identified., spread across the city, the ghmc had earlier set up 3,000 garbage bins of different measurements and as officials pointed out, there would be no more than 1,500 in place now with most of the available ones in bad shape. since the last few years, there was no stock taken on the condition of the bins and no effort made to replace the lost and damaged ones, he lamented., shifting the collected garbage itself had been mired in issues for long with the condition of vehicles used objected to by many. the sight of most of these vehicles leaving behind a trail of waste spilling from them on the roads is not very uncommon., the fleet presently deployed for garbage-moving has 300 vehicles that comprise 25 tonners, 10 tonners, dumpers and small tippers. “a proposal to acquire about 50 big and medium vehicles has been hanging fire for more than a year,” pointed out the official., efforts to acquire dumping sites come to naught, the ghmc presently uses the nearly 330 acre dump yard at jawaharnagar to deposit all the collected waste and its efforts to acquire more sites have come to nought so far. few years ago, an exercise was taken up to identify sites to locate dump yards and official teams went scouting in different parts of the city including shadnagar, patancheru and shamirpet., one site at choutuppal in nalgonda district was selected and even paper transactions were completed with the district administration but ensuing public resentment and interference by politicians ensured it remained on the backburner., soon after he took over as chief minister, k. chandrasekhar rao, in june 2014, underscored the need for safe and effective disposal of garbage and directed the ghmc to develop more dumping yards, at least 10 to 15 in different places around the city. however, almost a year later, not much appears to have been done on the issue., a few years ago, the ghmc had entered into an agreement with a private firm, ramky, for the integrated solid waste management project at jawaharnagar with the agency expected to take up the job of collection, transportation and disposal of garbage. however, the civic body could only ensure the disposal aspect of the project for the firm, which had the entire concept ending up in delays and confusion., grand plans for swachh

at the issue from a holistic perspective by improvising the waste management process and promoting waste-to-energy units with a total capacity of about 1,033 mw, to begin with, through various incentives., the nature of the mission is set to become clear by august 15 when the niti aayog’s sub-committee of chief ministers that looks into swachh bharat mission will submit its report to the

2015-09-18,mayors stumble on smart city mission,"on the morning of september 4, a group of mayors from various states of north india arrived at a luxury hotel in new delhi to attend a workshop on the national democratic alliance (nda) government’s smart city mission. in his opening remarks, union urban development minister venkaiah naidu said the bharatiya janata party-led government has formulated “radical policy” shifts in india’s urban governance that empowers mayors to take back control of cities from states and encourages them to be self-reliant., but as the workshop continued, one could cut through the official rhetoric and pick holes in the smart city initiative. from a logistical standpoint, the mayors, who are frontrunners of the mission, found it hard to follow the mission guidelines. previous urban development schemes had rendered them powerless and they were reduced to mere bystanders watching the central government handing over projects to state ministers. as the new set of urban policies — smart city mission, swachh bharat mission, atal mission for rejuvenation and urban transformation (amrut) — claim to transfer powers of designing and building cities to municipalities, the shift has been overwhelming., the mandate, sidelining state ministries, establishes direct contact between the municipal bodies and the urban development ministry, and the coordination assures easy access to central funding with minimum bureaucratic delays. on the other hand, the municipal commissioners, who are trained to administer the city services, are struggling to make the transition from being armchair bureaucrats to on-ground managers, tasked with designing solutions to meet peoples’ “aspirations”., for the entire mission, the centre has asked the states to generate half the funding (rs. 48,000 crore) through public-private partnerships. and mayors are encouraged to use their political clout to attract private investors., if all these elements work in tandem, the government is optimistic that one smart city will inspire an urban sprawl expected to function more on private investments, less on government funding. the endgame is to generate as many urban centres as possible and ensure a double digit gdp. , to speed up growth for a slowing economy and create a consuming class of city dwellers, the role of a municipal body is crucial. since the smart city initiative is cutting out aggressive state spending, municipalities have to generate funds from private investors and take capacity-building measures to initiate big projects. but that is precisely where the shortcoming exists. at the end of the workshop, when the floor was thrown open for questions, mamta pandey, mayor of satna municipal corporation in madhya pradesh, asked the panellists if she could construct a hospital instead of a smart city. though her town has qualified to build one, the question was irrelevant, evidence that ms. pandey was not familiar with the project guidelines. and ms. pandey is not the only mayor out of touch with the shifting urban demographics. speaking to the hindu, captain j.m. pathania, director, urban development in himachal pradesh, who also attended the workshop, said it is a rare sight to see mayors well-informed about the government policies. most of them, he said, are devoted to pleasing their political patrons., shadow of jnnurmin the recent past, the efforts of roping in private investors to quickly transform societies have often hindered urban progress. between 2008 and 2014, the previous congress-led united progressive alliance (upa) government rolled out the ambitious jawaharlal nehru national urban renewal mission (jnnurm), and partially relied on private sector investments to speed up its implementation. much to their dismay, private investors refused to come forward. out of 2,900 jnnurm projects, only 50 projects were backed by the public-private-partnership (ppp) model, with a private sector capital investment of just about rs. 1,000 crore, which barely covered 0.2 per cent of the total project cost.",0.02291821273964131,mayors stumble smart city mission,"morning september

2015-09-29,can modi do a swachh bharat on public safety?,"deaths or tragedies are the sad part of human life and nothing much can be done about them. but the manner in which people are killed in some of the tragedies that has grabbed news headline these past few months is quite dreadful to say the least. reading about it on a regular basis, and as a country we should worry about the safety of citizens. a country as large in size and population as india will probably be prone to mishaps. statistics will give proof that india as a country will come across as more vulnerable when it comes to public tragedies. this, however, should not put us into sigh or inaction. we need to turn attention to the question of safety for a billion plus population and this need to come into the forefront of our public discourse, which at present is not there. public safety ought to be a priority as the clean india (swachh bharat) campaign. hopefully prime minister narendra modi can take the lead in addressing this equally fundamental right of every citizen to live in safety., the latest in a long list of tragic accidents reported from across the country this year alone is >the death of over 100 people and nearly 150 injured after a massive blast caused by mining explosives stored in a building ripped through a crowded area in petlwad town in jhabua district of madhya pradesh. the deadly accident happened on september 12, triggered by gelatine sticks, used for mining, that were illegally stored along with lpg cylinders in a nearby home. on the same day, two british women were killed and 11 people injured after three carriages of a >tourist train derailed on its way to the himalayan city of shimla. and if that was not enough, in yet another accident, two people were killed as nine coaches of a duronto express going from secunderabad to mumbai >derailed in karnataka early on september 12. just a few months back, the derailment of two trains in madhya pradesh’s harda town had killed at least 31 people and several left injured., just consider that in the last few months alone there has been countless number of people killed, not in terror strikes by militants, but of innocent citizens who have fallen victim because they live in a dangerous country, which is evident from india's poor safety track record. whether it is the death toll arising out of accidents involving our public transport system, the construction sector, roads, food, medicines or just about the risk to life and limb from the larger eco-system around us, including the >most recent stampede in andhra pradesh during the holy dip, something must be done to ensure better safety of our citizens. it does not require rocket science theory to understand that the casualty from some of the accidents cited above is higher than — say soldiers killed in recent terrorist strikes., recent media reports on a range of tragic events will throw light on perhaps what needs to be done across different concerns but all related to public safety measures and the response that must come. for instance, toxic or adulterated liquor takes a heavy toll of lives each year. as per media reports, the death toll from a >recent hooch tragedy in mumbai, maharashtra was 98 with many others under treatment in various hospitals. every passing year scores of people die after consuming unsafe liquor. the issue of bootlegging and adulterated liquor that is sold illegally is a chronic problem that will need more stringent measures besides having a relook at liquor prohibition policy., then take the case of counterfeit medicines or drugs. in a startling disclosure recently, the central bureau investigation (cbi) director anil sinha, while speaking at the first indo-french workshop on ‘combating counterfeit medicine’, pointed out that more people have died due to consuming counterfeit medicines than those who have died of terrorism in the last 40 years. the cbi director was quoting an estimate of international agency interpol. and as mentioned by him, though the problem in india has not reached an alarming proportion, “nevertheless we cannot ignore this global menace, which is slowly taking the shape of a transnational organised crime”. to stop circulation of spurious drugs in india and protect consumers will require alertness of our security systems., other more visible endanger to public safety can be seen almost on a regular basis — those involving our public transport system, roads and other public service utilities. a few weeks ago, around 15 people were killed after a >high-tension wire fell on a bus in rajasthan; 22 people died after >a van fell into the godavari river in andhra pradesh; five were killed in punjab after a >leak in an ammonia gas tanker; still later 17, including five children were killed in a tractor-truck collision. and earlier around this time last year, 61 construction workers were killed and several others injured in a >building collapse in chennai. a building collapse in january in the tourist resort of goa claimed at least 14 lives. a few years ago, the collapse of a> lalita park building in east delhi had killed 71 people., remember these are casualty figures for only the recent past. deaths from unsafe building construction, traffic violation and other poor safety standards in india will be staggering. even after several commissions of enquiries or reports prepared, why are we still witnessing illegal and unauthorized practices endangering public safety? even in the latest accident at jhabua, the madhya pradesh government was very prompt to order a judicial inquiry. but what has been the benefit of such probes when remedial measures are not acted on? have we the public cared to even ask the government to put such reports in the public domain? have people been brought to book for committing offenses that compromise public safety? perhaps large scale corruption along with the general poor standard that we maintain and encourage, especially in the government (public) sector ought to be blamed. as in the case of crimes like terrorism or murder, the rule of law must also work to deter public safety hazards., ironically even for the media, when accidents or tragic events take place, it makes front-page news but the issue of public safety is not given too much importance perhaps because of its low advertising value. once a tragedy serves its purpose of making news, the question of public safety vanishes into oblivion until the next tragedy strikes. the media in india must give greater prominence to the question of public safety so that the required attention is brought to bear on public policy.",-0.04435132051411124,modi swachh bharat public safety ?,"deaths tragedies

2015-10-10,grime on the ghat,"faith and hope are the two wheels that have kept varanasi moving since time immemorial. | photo credit: k_r_deepak , these days, those using public toilets in varanasi are gently reminded that they have prime minister narendra modi to thank for the relief. these public utilities have been given a facelift with walls on three sides — passers-by can still watch you in the act — and a roof, on which sits a water tank. they have been painted a deep shade of saffron and bear a proud proclamation: ‘pradhan mantri shri narendra modi ji ki prerana se (inspired by prime minister narendra modi)’., when i first spot a urinal, a rickshaw-puller is there, and as i look at his back and then at the slogan, i wonder what exactly is inspired by modi: his act or the facelift?, of course, it has to be the urinal, but since it looks filthy in spite of the fresh paint, the proclamation seems open to interpretation. unlike this man, many others choose the open drain rather than the revamped facility., a labourer squatting across the road says, “the stench is unbearable. the water tank is empty, the pipe has come off, the taps don’t work. they used poor quality material, which didn’t last even a month.”, “do you find varanasi cleaner than before?” , “why ask me, babu?” he says, taking a long drag from his bidi. “walk down the road and you will see for yourself.”, i had seen it for myself, of course, when the autorickshaw had brought me from mughal sarai to varanasi some days before, via the residential neighbourhood of lanka. what had struck me was the filth, even though my eyes are long used to the sight of garbage — and this is a city represented in parliament by modi, the country’s chief executive, who wants a swachh bharat, or clean india. reality, clearly, lay outside the realm of social media., while nearly everybody i speak to agrees that varanasi remains just as dirty as before, in spite of modi being in power for a year and a half, no one wants to blame him for the mess., “give him some more time, he doesn’t have a magic wand,” says a trader., “why blame modi when the people of varanasi don’t have any civic sense? you will see them throwing rubbish on the road from the terrace,” says an artist., “modi wants to clean up varanasi but the state government is stalling his schemes. the state government wants the city to remain dirty to show modiji in a poor light,” says the manager of a lodge., “modiji is trying his best, but the ministers he has assigned to look after varanasi aren’t doing enough. they come here, pose for the cameras and go back. he should send spies instead of ministers to see what’s going on,” says the owner of an art gallery., “he is the prime minister, he has bigger worries, but i am 100 per cent sure he will improve the condition of varanasi. why 100 per cent, i am 200 per cent sure,” says a teacher., faith and hope are the two wheels that have kept varanasi moving since time immemorial, and these responses are in keeping with the spirit of the holy city, even though everyone, when i ask them if their lives had changed in any way ever since modi became the prime minister, replies with an emphatic “no”., “how can one modi change our lives?” says the art gallery owner. “who is modi anyway to change our lives? kashi is the city of lord vishwanath — no one else matters in this city.”, he is right. modi, if you walk the streets of the city, is barely visible in varanasi — except in the signage at public urinals. actually, there is one more spot in the city where his presence is overwhelming: assi ghat., assi ghat sits on the southern extreme of the row of 84 ghats that constitute the riverfront of varanasi, and has been in the news recently for being completely renovated, by mr. modi of course., “all my life i didn’t even know that stone steps existed at assi ghat because it remained buried under silt,” deepak jaiswal, the caretaker of my lodge, tells me as i set out for the ghat one evening. “go take a look now, modiji has cleaned it up. pura chakachak hai (it’s all spruced up)!”, assi ghat looks spruced up no doubt, designed to impress tourists more than pilgrims: a new stage has been erected to host cultural events; benches with backrests (something that ghats at varanasi never had) have been installed at various places; and, instead of the modi-inspired urinal, it has a state-of-the-art toilet complex, run by sulabh international., it was sulabh that cleaned up the ghat and is now maintaining it — the central government sanctioned close to rs.30 crore for the project, formally titled “development of area around assi ghat, varanasi” — and i find sulabh sweepers constantly at work, one of them dislodging silt from the base of the ghat with the help of a hosepipe., initially, however, earthmovers were used to remove the silt, and the machines — being machines — could not distinguish between silt and stone and ended up damaging the tall octagonal platforms (called marhi by the locals) at the adjoining ganga mahal ghat. they are yet to be repaired, their broken stones a testimony to the force with which the clean-up was carried out., from assi ghat, i walk downstream to prabhu ghat, one of my two favourite ghats of varanasi, the other being darbhanga ghat. i like them because they are clean, set against handsome, historical structures, and have an old-world feel about them — ideal spots in the city to gaze at the river., at prabhu ghat, i find young men with guitars sitting on the steps. loudspeakers are being set up and standees erected. a musical programme is about to begin: a radio channel is celebrating the first anniversary of a show in which budding singers from the city are invited to perform, and many of those singers are in attendance now., a small audience has already gathered, among them a lady who stands out because every now and then, someone or the other, mostly young men, touch her feet., “who is she?” i ask the boatman, a boy of 17, who has become friendly with me in a matter of minutes., “she is the one who cleaned up prabhu ghat,” he says., “was this ghat also dirty?”, “unimaginably dirty. go talk to her,” the boy says., the lady, temsutula imsong, who is 32 now, was born in a village called ungma in nagaland. she studied in shillong, went on to work in delhi, and in 2012, came to ghazipur, near varanasi, to join an ngo started by her friend — an ex-navy man — who is now her husband. that’s how she first set eyes on the ghats of varanasi., “this ghat was an open toilet when i first saw it,” she told me. “it was buried under silt — you couldn’t see the steps — and people were relieving themselves wherever they pleased. it irked me.”, one day in march this year, she and a woman friend — who has now left varanasi — pooled in some money, bought brooms, buckets, masks and some basic equipment, and, enlisting the support of local boatmen and idlers on the ghat, began cleaning it., “were you inspired by the swachh bharat campaign?”, “no, nothing like that. though when we were cleaning up the place, we could hear passersby saying, ‘see, see, modiji’s campaign is going on!’”, modi has acknowledged her work. he mentioned her name in two tweets, she said. a local paper called her ‘kashi ki bahu’ — the daughter-in-law of kashi, or varanasi. “i take that as a compliment, even though that’s not correct, i am the daughter-in-law of ghazipur,” she laughs. as i sit with her on the steps, more boys touch her feet as they walk past.",0.076771514537472,grime ghat,"faith hope two wheels kept varanasi moving since time immemorial. &#124; photo credit : k_r_deepak , days , using public toilets varanasi gently reminded prime minister narendra modi thank relief. public utilities given facelift walls three sides — passers-by still watch act — roof , sits water tank. painted deep shade saffron bear proud proclamation : ‘pradhan mantri shri narendra modi ji ki prerana se ( inspired prime minister narendra modi ) ’ . , first spot urinal , rickshaw-puller , look back slogan , wonder exactly inspired modi : act facelift?

2015-11-21,"our waste, our responsibility","we need to ensure that human waste is disposed of in a safe, humane and sustainable manner. , early in september this year, the legendary prof. robert chambers visited a village in uttar pradesh to survey the progress of the swachh bharat mission. in one home, he went down on his knees and put his hand in literally to inspect the contents of the twin pit latrine there., the idea was to allay the fears and scepticism of the villagers and show them that the human waste in the five-year-old pit had changed completely into compost, with no odour or contaminants, and was ready to use as fertiliser., few of us would do what prof. chambers did, and he in turn was merely following in the footsteps of gandhi. but with world toilet day just going by on november 19 and the government now levying a swachh bharat cess on our incomes, it is time to think of not just superficial ways to improve cleanliness but to go deeper and jolt us out of our deeply ingrained notions of purity and pollution., as swachh bharat slogans buzz around us, many scholars warn that this mission’s fate will be similar to previous experiments such as nirmal bharat abhiyan and total sanitation campaign if primacy is not given to changing hygiene behaviour rather than to merely meet toilet construction targets., last year’s squat report showed clearly that most indians continue to believe in perverse notions of ‘purity and pollution’ driven by rigid brahminical ideas wherein polluting the external environment is taken for granted while homes are kept ‘clean’ by not building or using toilets indoors. as long as this mindset continues, the idea of a ‘clean india’ cannot materialise., this is the reason why the issue of open defecation must be opened up, public conversations created around it, and collective action initiated. the situation is ironic because the act of defecation is kept outside the home, thus attempting to hide it, but by defecating outside people are exposing themselves in public., the real idea of ‘purity and pollution’ must be linked to healthy living and physical and mental wellbeing. this puts diarrhoeal deaths, malnutrition and stunted growth at the forefront and makes safe sanitary conditions primary. second, the message needs to be driven in that it is not someone else’s responsibility to clean your waste, but your own., a recent news report told a horrifying story of a young dalit boy being asked to clean up a schoolmate’s excreta. manual scavenging persists, despite laws banning it. all of it is due to the age-old notion of individual purity being maintained by the labour of others. a recent paper by jnu scholar amit thorat and the rice institute’s dean spears talks of how our sanitation habits are deeply rooted in caste and untouchability practices., one way to address this would be to ensure the presence and participation of dalits and other communities, who have been exploited as society’s ‘cleaners’, in the decision making at each level. they must be a part of mandated decision-making bodies such as village water and sanitation committees, district water and sanitation missions/ committees and state water and sanitation missions so that they can influence sanitation planning, implementation and monitoring., could the marketplace provide some answers? for this, it is worth looking at some examples of how companies have transformed consumers into responsible customers. today, a mcdonald’s customer collects the food, pays for it, consumes it and then disposes of the waste. similarly, travellers taking flights are increasingly buying tickets, doing self check-ins and carrying their luggage on their own. while a mcdonald’s may follow this method to cut costs, the logic could be institutionalised to inculcate the idea of the individual taking responsibility for the safe disposal of the waste produced by defecating in the open. but this also means that the government must ensure that the poor, who still can’t afford basic housing (whether in rural or urban areas), are not penalised for open defecation by this logic of citizen’s accountability — unless they are included within a broader umbrella where such basic services are provided for them by the government., in fact, even people who use a flushable toilet need to be told that there is no guarantee that the waste they create is being safely disposed of at the end of the sanitation cycle. a recent faecal management study conducted by wateraid india finds that new delhi, with the best sewage treatment capacity in the country, is at present able to treat only about 60 per cent of the total sewerage being produced, leaving 40 per cent untreated in the open environment. in essence, it would not be wrong to suggest that 40 per cent of delhi’s population indirectly defecates in the open. the challenge is to create a narrative of responsibility and awareness around this., while state accountability is undoubtedly a part of it, citizen accountability, especially of the well-off sections, needs to be addressed. in this context, the story of the sanitation drive in 19th century london needs to be redesigned and re-disseminated in india. it was only after the elite began to be badly impacted by cholera epidemics in london that they began to take the issue of sanitation and hygiene seriously. the narrative of a campaign, therefore, needs to weave in both the rich and the poor in a role of common responsibility and complementarity to ensure the larger health of the society. the swachh bharat mission would merely provide an entry point to this., at the policy level, the government needs to invest adequately in behavioural change. ironically, the present government has cut down the budget ratio for this from 15 per cent to a meagre 8 per cent. but even that small amount rarely gets utilised due to a hardware-obsessed bureaucracy. similarly, 60-70 per cent of the budget earmarked to rehabilitate manual scavengers is returned unutilised every year because it is on nobody’s priority list. and the business of cleaning up someone else’s waste continues

2015-12-28,the map of neighbourly outreach,"the dramatic diplomacy that unfolded across >afghanistan-pakistan-india on christmas day may be the first clear admission from prime minister narendra modi that >dealing with pakistan is not a simple task. and that his government’s ill-thought-out jingoism of its early months in power needs to be tempered with a mature and realistic approach if he has to focus on and achieve the grand slogans ranging from “swachh bharat” to “make in india”., ever since mr. modi swept to power in the summer of 2014, his foreign policy has been packed mostly with spectacle and some boldness. he kicked off by inviting the south asian association for regional cooperation (saarc) leaders to his swearing-in, but soon let strident rhetoric lead the bilateral engagement with pakistan. that early spark of hope was dashed by aggressive statements from the highest levels, and almost a wanton abandonment of restraint along the international border (ib) and the line of control (loc)., the initial freezediplomatic engagements with pakistan nosedived to embarrassing childishness. in august 2014, foreign secretary-level talks were called off after the pakistani high commissioner, abdul basit, met kashmiri separatists; the same excuse was given a year later to call off national security adviser (nsa)-level talks in new delhi. the modi government’s strategy gave a new lease of life to hurriyat factions, while adversely affecting the situation in the kashmir valley and along the ib and the loc., militant infiltration and the occasional provocation from across the border have long been the routine, but the tough posture adopted in the wake of the april-may general election in india coincided with, if not resulted in, a dramatic rise in cross-border firings. dozens of civilians and many paramilitary personnel were killed or injured, and normal life along the border was disrupted., the pattern of terrorists sneaking into india from across the border and, within hours, launching attacks on a target close to the border, be it a security installation or a civilian target such as gurdaspur in punjab in july 2015, became more pronounced. in the kashmir valley, the fog of war intensified. while more local youth took to militancy, the mysterious rise of flamboyant militant commanders, their unusual escape from several encounter scenes, and final elimination after a few months of their stardom was a recurrent phenomenon., the new aggressive phase wasn’t all that surprising, given the verbal volleys lobbed by mr. modi against pakistan in the run-up to the 2014 general election., reality from south blockthe grand settings of lutyens’ delhi have an uncanny capacity to temper a ruler, even if he pretends to be a macho outsider. mr. modi is finally showing signs of realism that his neighbourhood policy cannot be complete without engagement with pakistan. his efforts over the past few weeks, to rekindle india-russia bilateral ties and to reach out to pakistan, are signs that the former gujarat chief minister is now finally becoming the indian prime minister. dramatic summits and humongous announcements do not often account for great diplomacy; it requires patience and perseverance., against the new mature phase of mr. modi’s diplomacy, it was, in hindsight, not a great surprise that he flew into lahore from kabul, on december 25, where the vagaries of violence are interspersed with buried egos of empires and signposts of india’s strategic interests. if afghanistan wasn’t the real reason that prompted mr. modi about the need to calibrate his pakistan policy, then he has to only walk a few yards from his office to an unnamed government bungalow close by, where the widow and children of former afghan president mohammad najibullah have been staying for over a quarter century. it was from the remnants of the afghan mujahideen who fought najibullah’s forces that the kashmir insurgency of the past three decades acquired sophistication, weapons and manpower, after new delhi messed up its kashmir policy., young warriors from madrassas of pakistan who rode into kabul to drag najibullah by a pickup truck, in 1996, and hang him in the streets were soon to shelter the al-qaeda. from this sponsorship by pakistan, of non-state violence and regressive political islam, the world got its new generation of terrorists and their broader ideology. from new york city’s world trade center complex to paris’s bataclan theatre, from mumbai’s streets to the many bombed markets across india, the signatures of violence nurtured by sections of the pakistani establishment and flourishing under its guidance cannot be ignored. precisely for this and other factors, india needs to remain engaged with the pakistani establishment., vajpayee, manmohan singh erasrhetoric about large-scale annihilations and macho responses to a dysfunctional democracy sound impressive in the heat of an election campaign but for a government, the challenge is to find ways to deal with the delinquent next door. mr. modi seems to have now picked up the gauntlet., it is the realisation of the complexity of dealing with pakistan that forced successive prime ministers to risk so much to engage with the neighbour, often without much success. atal bihari vajpayee took the gamble of riding a bus across the contentious border, only to be faced with the kargil incursion a few weeks later. it may be a mere coincidence that nawaz sharif was the one who hosted mr. vajpayee in lahore then, and now mr. modi, despite his perilous survival in a military-dominated state., both mr. vajpayee and manmohan singh worked with a significant number of pakistan experts, within the prime minister’s office and ministry of external affairs and on the track ii circuit, to steer their policies. pakistan is a state like none other. as you sit back taking in the success of diplomatic outreach, militants can sneak across the border to occupy strategic heights; as you prepare for a major push to improving bilateral trade, you may find a few men rowing across the sea to launch a deadly terrorist attack on your commercial capital. pakistan is a state in deep crisis, fighting its many demons, and with statecraft deeply embedded in misguided military chauvinism. however, those, and other factors, cannot be the only issues to dictate india’s engagement with pakistan., the engagement should be primarily informed by the fact that india’s economic growth, including its ability to keep government expenses under check, enjoy global market trust and attract investment, is all critically hinged on a peaceful south asia. no other reason is needed to appreciate why india will have to keep talking to pakistan., dealing with pakistan is like playing football on a rainy day and on a muddy ground. the team needs to have the skill, the ability to anticipate the unexpected, the response without losing one’s nerve, and the stamina to keep playing despite the downpour. no one who has watched the modi government closely will grant all that to his narrow, centralised, decision-making structure where very few seem to have any influence on foreign policy. if the lahore drop-in was the first key step in mr. modi’s new balanced pakistan policy, then it must immediately be followed by a broadbasing of intellectual inputs that inform his decisions., defining permanent intereststhe excuses offered by the modi government to muddy india-pakistan relations over the last year-and-a-half were no new discoveries. for long, even under both mr. vajpayee and dr. singh, india has introduced new goalposts, or moved existing ones. on the sidelines of the saarc summit in kathmandu in 2001, mr. vajpayee’s foreign minister, jaswant singh, was clear with the demand: he produced a list of 20 wanted people allegedly living under state protection in pakistan, and asked that islamabad dismantle the infrastructure of terror. by the end of 2008, after the mumbai attacks, the manmohan singh government’s demands were focussed on action against those responsible for the attack on mumbai.",0.0632361753124465,map neighbourly outreach,"dramatic diplomacy unfolded across >afghanistan-pakistan-india christmas day may first clear admission prime minister narendra modi >dealing pakistan simple task. government ’ ill-thought-out jingoism early months power needs tempered mature realistic approach focus achieve grand slogans ranging “swachh bharat ” “make india ” . , ever since mr. modi swept power summer 2014 , foreign policy packed mostly spectacle boldness. kicked inviting south asian association regional cooperation ( saarc ) leaders swearing-in , soon let strident rhetoric lead bilateral engagement pakistan. early spark hope dashed aggressive statements highest levels , almost wanton abandonment restraint along international border ( ib ) line control ( loc ) . , initial freezediplomatic engagements pakistan nosedived embarrassing childishness. august 2014 , foreign secretary-level talks called pakistani high commissioner , abdul basit , met kashmiri separatists ;

2016-03-02,emptying the idea of india,"the current strategy of the bharatiya janata party (bjp) is to mount relentless rhetorical attacks on the “anti” in anti-national while leaving the “nation” in national carefully empty. it was showcased in parliament by human resource development >minister smriti irani in her enactment of what a popular film song once referred to as “emosanal atyachar”. but when she said, “i am not certifying your idea of india but do not demean mine”, ms. irani was being unduly modest because she was actually doing much more than “not certifying” the idea of india — she was evacuating it. juxtaposed against the silent emptiness of this idea was the eloquent fullness of her righteous rage against those who would demean it. this clever tactic captured the moral high ground by framing the motion to be debated as “insults to the nation cannot be tolerated”, thus trapping opponents in defensive positions on the swampy terrain of insults by denying them a foothold on any firm conception of the nation. but the ploy worked only as long as the idea of india was left undefined. she was under fire the moment she tried to label mahishasura worship as anti-national, because this defined the nation as exclusively limited to durga worshippers, a specific definition that was immediately challenged., emotion over reasondespite being an intangible idea, the nation is quite real because it is a shared idea. symbols of nationhood are important for this sharing to be reliably reproduced, which is why we have familiar aids to memory like maps, flags, or the figure of mother india. national symbols are extremely powerful because they connect to compressed reservoirs of intense emotion., that is why publicly invoking these symbols has to be an act of responsible citizenship and not self-serving demagoguery, but the difference can be hard to tell. the problem with emotive symbols is that though they can multiply the force of arguments, they cannot replace the arguments themselves. all persuasion harnesses symbols but principled persuasion must also provide arguments that can be rationally debated., the bjp strategy is a cynical ploy to maximise the emotive impact of symbols while refusing reasoned argument. it is cynical in its unfair fixation on a real or imagined “anti” without allowing the accused the space to speak of the conception of nation that informs the allegedly “anti-national” act. the shameless resort to a partisan use of state power to terrorise, silence and break opponents makes this cynicism dangerous. how else can one explain why lawyers who repeatedly indulged in violent assaults on court premises, or journalists who wantonly incited violence based on fake evidence are not in jail — but kanhaiya kumar, umar khalid and anirban bhattacharya are?, to be fair, during the past two decades the nation idea has been under siege globally, and not only in india. when it first came into its own in the nineteenth century, the nation seemed to define a common boundary for cultural belonging, economic interdependence, and political accountability. in the era of globalisation, the cultural, economic and political dimensions of the nation have diverged, thus undermining the sovereignty of the idea itself. in india, these processes began to take effect from the 1980s, long before the dominance of the bjp., weapon of mass distractionagainst this background, narendra modi’s election campaign emphasised inclusive development — sabka saath, sabka vikas — with hindutva as a side show. unfortunately, until now the modi regime has been unable to deliver on virtually all of its promises on the economic front — it remains to be seen whether the 2016 budget will effect a welcome change of direction. the sudden deepening of inequalities has fuelled frustrations among the very groups that were its most enthusiastic supporters, such as patidars, jats or the urban middle classes., historically, regimes unable to provide bread have had to stage circuses of one kind or another to retain their credibility. these have taken the form of highly publicised programmes and campaigns with little or no real content, like swachh bharat abhiyan or beti bachao beti padhao. because of these economic setbacks, the cultural front has had to bear a heavier burden. there has been a marked escalation in communal tensions, with various “fringe” outfits and individuals taking on a central role. the characteristic form of these events is a claimed insult to hindu sentiment or “indian culture”. why do these campaigns invariably take a negative form, from the attempts to convert valentine’s day into parents’ day or christmas into good governance day, through the beef ban, right up to the ayodhya ram mandir campaign? is it really impossible to become a good hindu today without opposing someone or something else?, the changing campusit is in this context that we need to place the quiet revolution in higher education that has taken place over the past two decades. today, in most non-technical institutions of higher learning women equal or exceed male students in numbers. after the 93rd constitutional amendment extended reservations, the caste (and class) composition of elite universities has been transformed. while muslims remain under-represented, most others have gained access, making our universities the only public spaces in contemporary india where almost all groups (barring the poorest) can meet and mingle in a relatively egalitarian setting. this newly democratised site is proving to be a massive source of anxiety and resentment for the current regime. campuses like those of the university of hyderabad or jawaharlal nehru university are seen as particularly dangerous because they are spaces where dalits are not only assertive but are making common cause with other marginalised groups including muslims., hence the vicious campaign against radical students and campuses, and the relentless repetition of the charge of being “anti-national”. the bitter irony here is that while the accused have been describing the india — and, as with rohith vemula, the world — that they stand for in passionate detail, the accusers have offered only the thinnest and emptiest of descriptions. nothing illustrates this better than the bizarre proposal to hoist gigantic national flags in universities. even more telling is the plan to showcase tanks and artillery on campuses in the hope that they will exude patriotism and provide immunity against the dreaded disease of critical thinking., whether it is sent intentionally or subconsciously, the message is sinister. the university and the army are at opposite ends of the state apparatus, one representing the nation’s desire to nurture critical perspectives and innovative thinking that will strengthen its ability to respond to change, the other representing the might of the state to be deployed after all hope of peaceful resolution is lost. by invoking the arm of the state that is the last resort of brute force in defence of the nation, is the government implying that it thinks of universities as enemy territory that must be conquered by force?",0.032736452535559686,emptying idea india,"current strategy bharatiya janata party ( bjp ) mount relentless rhetorical attacks “anti ” anti-national leaving “nation ” national carefully empty. showcased parliament human resource development >minister smriti irani enactment popular film song referred “emosanal atyachar ” . said , “i certifying idea india demean mine ” , ms. irani unduly modest actually much “not certifying ” idea india — evacuating it. juxtaposed silent emptiness idea eloquent fullness righteous rage would demean it. clever tactic captured moral high ground framing motion debated “insults nation cannot tolerated ” , thus trapping opponents defensive positions swampy terrain insults denying foothold firm conception nation. ploy worked long idea india left undefined. fire moment tried label mahishasura worship anti-national , defined nation exclusively limited durga worshippers , specific definition immediately challenged. , emotion reasondespite intangible idea , nation quite real shared idea. symbols nationhood important sharing reliably reproduced , familiar aids memory like maps , flags , figure mother india. national symbols extremely powerful connect compressed reservoirs intense emotion. , publicly invoking symbols act responsible citizenship self-serving demagoguery , difference hard tell. problem emotive symbols though multiply force arguments , cannot replace arguments themselves. persuasion harnesses symbols principled persuasion must also provide arguments rationally debated. , bjp strategy cynical ploy maximise emotive impact symbols refusing reasoned argument. cynical unfair fixation real imagined “anti ” without allowing accused space speak conception nation informs allegedly “anti-national ” act. shameless resort partisan use state power terrorise , silence break opponents makes cynicism dangerous. else one explain lawyers repeatedly indulged violent assaults court premises , journalists wantonly incited violence based fake evidence jail — kanhaiya kumar , umar khalid anirban bhattacharya are?

2016-04-12,clearing the smoke on lpg reform,"overcoming pitfalls: “the distribution system needs to be strengthened to be able to meet the expected increase in demand, particularly in rural areas, as non-availability of fuel could push people back towards using solid fuels.” a scene at jarugumalai, tamil nadu. — photo: e. lakshmi narayanan | photo credit: e_lakshmi narayanan , one of the less discussed but potentially far-reaching features of this year’s budget was the launch of the >pradhan mantri ujjwala yojana (pmuy). the rs.8,000-crore scheme aims to provide subsidised liquefied petroleum gas (lpg) connections to about 60 per cent of below poverty line (bpl) households — roughly as many households as there are in germany — by 2019. the idea itself is not new as subsidised connections to >bpl households have been provided under various schemes even earlier. however, the scale of this programme is what sets it apart. until 2013, 75 lakh predominantly rural, subsidised bpl connections were disbursed under various schemes. fifty-five lakh subsidised bpl connections are claimed to have been provided in the last year under the “give back” scheme linked to the “give it up” campaign. in comparison, the pmuy aims to provide subsidised connections to five crore households in three years., fuel use and health, about 75 crore indians, especially women and girls, are exposed to severe household air pollution (hap) from the use of solid fuels such as biomass, dung cakes and coal for cooking. a report from the ministry of health & family welfare places hap as the second leading risk factor contributing to india’s disease burden. in comparison, poor sanitation, which has received much-needed attention of late, ranks 15th. according to the world health organization, solid fuel use is responsible for about 13 per cent of all mortality and morbidity in india (measured as disability-adjusted life years), and causes about 40 per cent of all pulmonary disorders, nearly 30 per cent of cataract incidences, and over 20 per cent each of ischemic heart disease, lung cancer and lower respiratory infection. thus, the pmuy is a very welcome initiative. however, the real test of the pmuy and its successor programmes will be in how they translate the provision of connections to sustained use of lpg or other clean fuels such as electricity or biogas. to pass this test, a few more issues need to be addressed., cost and distribution first, cooking fuel should be available at an affordable cost to back up the initial provision of subsidised connections. each bpl household would have to spend up to rs.5,000 each year on lpg even at current subsidised prices — in addition to a one-time cost of rs.1,800 for the connection — which may be unaffordable to many. the pmuy has proposed payment in instalments for stoves and cylinders to address this challenge, which is welcome. in addition, it may consider increasing >lpg subsidies for the first few cylinders bought in a year by bpl households. with the success of the “give it up” campaign and the proposal to proactively exclude all those earning above rs.10 lakh per annum from lpg subsidies, the burden on the exchequer for the increased subsidies to bpl households may be minimal, particularly in comparison to the huge health and economic benefits that come with it., second, the distribution system needs to be strengthened to be able to meet the expected increase in demand, particularly in rural areas, as non-availability of fuel could push people back towards using solid fuels. ensuring reliable, sustained, last-mile supply would require multiple steps. it requires a large extension of distribution networks, especially in rural areas, since each rural distribution agency typically caters to fewer customers than urban agencies. reports that many jan-dhan accounts have zero balance raise concerns about whether subsidy transfer to such accounts will work effectively; so, implementation of direct benefit transfer schemes must be made more robust. effective monitoring and grievance redressal systems are equally important to ensure that problems in the scheme are highlighted and addressed early. the scheme should be accompanied by a focussed public relations campaign, similar to the national tuberculosis or swachh bharat campaigns, to build awareness and create a “demand pull”, not only for clean cooking but also for good service. ensuring reliable supply is also likely to require strengthening the refining, bottling and pipeline infrastructure. in the absence of such supporting measures, the pmuy runs the risk of failing like the >rajiv gandhi grameen vidyutikaran yojana, which succeeded in extending physical electricity infrastructure at great cost but has not been able to ensure a reliable supply of affordable electricity to households.",0.13878552003552005,clearing smoke lpg reform,"overcoming pitfalls : “the distribution system needs strengthened able meet expected increase demand , particularly rural areas , non-availability fuel could push people back towards using solid fuels. ” scene jarugumalai , tamil nadu. — photo : e. lakshmi narayanan &#124;

2016-05-16,dumbing down of indian politics,"today's leaders:“instead of visionary statesmen, we have showmen who are in the business of self-promotion.” file photo of a bjp poster before the new delhi assembly elections, at a bus stop in the capital. photo: sushil kumar verma , our ruling dispensation draws heavily upon the symbols and rituals of hinduism to justify its authority. but leaders of this brand of politics do not seem to be conversant with discourses on statecraft in brahmanical texts of ancient india. consider santi parva, the twelfth episode of the mahabharata, in which the patriarch bhishma tutors a dithering monarch of hastinapur, yudhishthira, on the responsibilities of a ruler. wending a leisurely way through the intellectual thickets of statecraft, geography, metaphysics, the cosmos, mythology, genealogy, history, and sankya and yoga philosophy, bhishma finally speaks of the obligations of the ruler., the first obligation of the ruler is to ensure prabhavaya, or prosperity of his subjects. the second is dharna, the holding together of all human beings. a righteous ruler must not draw arbitrary boundaries between those who ‘belong’ and those who do not. the third obligation is that of non-violence. the rules of raj dharma thus place limits on power., where is the emphasis on dharna?, let us fast forward to the >2014 lok sabha elections that swept narendra modi into power. in speeches laced with demagoguery, contempt for political opponents, and asides that verged on the abusive, he paid ritual obeisance to development and transformed it into an abracadabra mantra. spectacularly missing was an emphasis on dharna, of ways of bringing diverse indians together through non-discrimination, justice, and non-violence., this glaring omission accounts for the complete bankruptcy of political debates today. societies as complex as india are not held together by ‘development’; they are bound by awareness of human desire for equality, dignity, and justice. democracy is not primarily about elections or ‘development’; it is about the recognition of citizens as possessing irreducible status, as people who count. there are certain things that must be done for them, and there are things that must not be done to them. this precept foregrounds the one central norm of democracy — that each and every citizen is of value and he or she must be accorded the respect due to him or her., but development does not recognise this aspect of collective life at all. in the name of development, agents appropriate natural resources and cause environmental disasters. the chariot of greed has displaced millions of people, and resulted in floating populations with no homes, steady jobs, or security against the exigencies of everyday life. for millions of indians, development is not about prabhavaya, let alone dharna or non-violence., of course we need development. but this concept is not a value in itself; it is a means to an end. human beings are capable of planning out what they want to do with their lives. instead of monitoring the books we read, the music we hear, the films we see, the conversations we have, the democratic state has to provide the preconditions for doing so. that is development., the failure to value the normative component of statecraft has led to a dumbing down of political discourse. what we have are >people being forced to mouth a vacant ‘bharat mata ki jai!’ at the risk of exile. mindless nationalism has emptied out the coffers of political discourse. it is time we put nationalism in its place, as a property of a political community which nurtures a sense of belonging. belonging comes through experiences of justice, not through the mouthing of pointless slogans even as custodians of the public good ransack resources with impunity. it is time the government reflects on how people can be held together in a democratic political community instead of instructing them how to live their lives., focussing on non-issues it is precisely because the normative components of justice, equality and toleration have not been privileged as the guiding features of our body politic that our energies are spent on non-issues. the media has expended many hours discussing whether the >prime minister and human resources development minister >smriti irani have degrees from some university or the other. is it not more important to see whether mr. modi has learnt anything from the basic courses of political science? sadly, our political scientist who speaks like a prophet of the old testament — all thunder, fire and brimstone — does not raise his voice against the injustice that cadres of his beloved rashtriya swayamsevak sangh wreak on hapless people., nor does he bother to listen to the voice of the political community that elected him to power. i wish for once, just once, he would stop lecturing us, exactly the way a school teacher speaks down to recalcitrant school children, and heed what citizens of india want, desire, and aspire for. democracy recognises that ordinary people possess political competence and are entitled to participate in policy discussions. they have a right to be heard and to hold their representatives to account for acts of omission and commission. that is why democracy is worthwhile. but a complete non-understanding of the value of democracy by the present leadership has led to dire impoverishment of our political discourse., consider, for instance, the ironies of the >swachch bharat campaign. i am perfectly aware of the virtues of sanitation. but is the manner in which the campaign has been conceptualised and put into practice up to the mark? the insincerity of the entire campaign was wonderfully captured in a photograph of hema malini advertising for swachch bharat. saree tucked in, she wields with considerable inexperience a long broom, even as ten security guards who cluster around her watch., perhaps the fault lies not in the leaders we have got, but in us. the 2014 elections were an indication of the summer of our disgruntlement. disenchantment with petty party politics, major corruption, and non-delivery on promises generated great hope: that a man riding a white horse and brandishing a swirling sword will come thundering in and solve all our problems. if in the process our party system and democracy are wiped out, so be it. we forget that the problems of society need collective understanding and action. above all, these problems can be resolved only when people who aspire to power understand the complexity that is india.",0.05269075894075895,dumbing indian politics,"today ' leaders : “instead visionary statesmen , showmen business self-promotion. ” file photo bjp poster new delhi assembly elections , bus stop capital. photo : sushil kumar verma , ruling dispensation draws heavily upon symbols rituals hinduism justify authority. leaders brand politics seem conversant discourses statecraft brahmanical texts ancient india. consider santi parva , twelfth episode mahabharata , patriarch bhishma tutors dithering monarch hastinapur , yudhishthira , responsibilities ruler. wending leisurely way intellectual thickets statecraft , geography , metaphysics , cosmos , mythology , genealogy , history , sankya yoga philosophy , bhishma finally speaks obligations ruler. , first obligation ruler ensure prabhavaya , prosperity subjects. second dharna , holding together human beings. righteous ruler must draw arbitrary boundaries ‘belong ’ not. third obligation non-violence. rules raj dharma thus place limits power. , emphasis dharna?

2016-05-23,"taking stock, two years on","llustration: satwik gade , in broad terms, two features distinguish social sector strategy of prime minister narendra modi. first, it endeavours to make the existing programs more efficient by cutting leakages. and second, it gives priority to empowerment over entitlement., early in its tenure, the government achieved a major success in financial inclusion with empowerment through prime >minister’s jana dhana yojana. this scheme proposed to give a bank account to every family. the program entered the guinness book of records for opening 1.8 crore accounts in one week from 23 to 29 august 2014. by may 2016, the scheme had opened 21.74 crore accounts with rs. 37,445 crore in deposits., alongside, the prime minister not only took the pragmatic decision of retaining and rapidly expanding the aadhaar biometric identification program but also accelerated its deployment for cutting wasteful expenditure in the delivery of social programs. recently, legislation has been passed that empowers the government to require the beneficiary of services financed from the consolidated fund of india to provide her aadhaar identity number. in turn, the government can link the beneficiary’s aadhaar identity number and bank account to which benefits are transferred. this direct benefit transfer (dbt) instrumentality complemented by aadhaar seeding of the bank account eliminates the possibility of benefits accruing to multiple accounts of the same beneficiary or to ghost accounts., large social programs such as the public distribution system (pds), mahatma gandhi national rural employment guarantee act (>mgnrega) and subsidized sales of fertilizer and liquid petroleum gas (lpg) cylinders have been subject to massive leakages through the use of multiple and ghost accounts. these leakages can now be plugged via dbt cum aadhaar instrumentality. the government has already successfully done this in the disbursement of the subsidy associated with the pds, mgnrega and lpg cylinders though the coverage remains far from complete. not all bank accounts have been linked to aadhaar., to-date, an estimated 3.5 crore multiple or ghost beneficiaries have been eliminated from the lpg rolls. during 2014-15 alone, this resulted in savings of rs. 14,672 crore. in mgnrega, similar weeding out of multiple or ghost beneficiaries resulted in a savings of rs. 3,000 crore in 2015-16. this amount is a little below 10% of the total mgnrega allocation. in pds, an estimated rs. 10,000 crore has been saved by elimination of 1.6 crore fake ration cards >using the aadhaar instrumentality., to empower rural households, the government has greatly accelerated the process of rural electrification and rural-road construction. during its two years in office, the government has brought electricity to 7,654 villages compared with 5,189 villages in the preceding three years. likewise, total rural road length constructed has been 36,340 and 36,450 kilometres during 2014-15 and 2015-16, respectively. in comparison, only 24,160 and 25,320 kilometres had been constructed during 2012-13 and 2013-14, respectively., approximately 12 crore households in india continue to use solid biomass fuels for cooking, with its attendant harmful effects on health. to-date, no serious effort has been made to free up these households of the black carbon they inhale while cooking. for years, efficient cook stoves have been promoted but they cover less than 1% of the affected families to-date., for the first time, the government has resolved to bring lpg cylinders to these households. the government has launched >pradhan mantri ujjawal yojana under which 5 crore bpl below poverty line households will be provided subsidized lpg cylinders over the next three years. the target for the current fiscal year is 1.5 crore households. the scheme is being financed in part from the savings generated through voluntary surrender of lpg subsidy by existing richer households. at prime minister’s call, one crore richer households have already given up this subsidy., in the budget 2015-16, the government launched atal pension scheme to provide a minimal insurance cover to workers in unorganized sector. under the scheme, the central government co-contributes the lower of 50% of the total contribution and rs. 1,000 per annum to each subscriber account for a period of 5 years. depending on his contribution, a subscriber under the age of 40 receives the fixed monthly pension of rs. 1000 to rs 5000 at the age of 60 years., in parallel, the central government has introduced >pradhan mantri suraksha bima yojana (insurance against accidental death) and jeevan jyoti bima yojana (insurance against death). the former provides cover for rs. 2 lakh in case of death and rs. 1 lakh in case of partial disability to individuals 18 to 70 years of age for a premium of rs. 12 per annum. the latter covers individuals between 18 and 50 years for rs. 2 lakh at a premium of rs. 330 per year. by 9 may 2016, 9.4 crore beneficiaries had enrolled under the suraksha bima yojana and 3 crore under the jeevan jyoti scheme. enrolment in atal pension yojana at 20 lakh was significantly lower., the budget 2016-17 announced three major initiatives related to health: insurance, >jan aushadhi scheme and dialysis programme. under the health insurance scheme, coverage for rs. 1 lakh is provided against hospitalization expenditure. for senior citizens, there is additional coverage of rs. 30,000. the government will cover eight crore families from economically weaker section free of charge through an aadhaar-linked programme. under jan aushadhi programme, the government will open 3,000 stores nationwide to provide low-cost generic drugs. with 2.2 lakh end stage renal disease patients added each year, the government has also announced a programme to provide dialysis services in all district hospitals., the government has introduced several measures towards improved implementation of mgnrega. it has given priority to low-hanging fruits such as water ponds and de-silting of water ponds in asset creation. it has also taken a more liberal approach towards building of private assets such as houses, wells and toilets for the poor. this has created ownership of assets by respective beneficiaries and led to better supervision of work. finally, the government has improved the convergence between mgnrega works and schemes such as skill development, prime minister’s krishi sinchai yojana, housing for all and >swachh bharat mission., in the area of higher education, regulations have been liberalized to give greater flexibility to women to complete their m. phil and ph.d. degrees. upon

2016-05-26,‘heart of delhi’ will have to find a new spot,"an urdu couplet lionising the “heart of delhi” will now brighten up a drab government building somewhere in the city, after locals prevented artists from painting the words at an east delhi site last week., two artists were painting the couplet on the wall of a delhi jal board pumping station on gt road in shahdara on may 20 as part of the government-supported “delhi, i love you” campaign, when they were surrounded by locals, some of whom claimed they were from the rashtriya swayamsevak sangh (rss), and forced to erase the line., the couplet in question was written by a post-graduate student of delhi university, zeeshan amjad, and was one of the 40 entries chosen for a public art campaign launched by “delhi, i love you” in september last., “ dilli tera ujarna, aur phir ujar ke basna. woh dil hai toone paya, sani nahi hai jiska . (oh delhi, you were ruined and you overcame your ruin to settle. no city has a heart like yours),” it said., the artists, akhlaq ahmad, who goes by shabbu, and swen simon, a french street artist consulting on the project, had just painted the background and the first line of the couplet when they were accosted., “they told us that we couldn’t paint the urdu line. they told us to write swachh bharat abhiyaan over it. i ended up having to do it as there were about 100 people surrounding us. they told us they were from the rss and that if we didn’t leave, there would be dire consequences,” said mr. ahmad., he added that the crowd hurled abuses at them, and only backed down when someone called the police. for both artists, this was the first time something like this had happened., “we had permissions from the government so there was nothing wrong. since i don’t speak hindi, i didn’t know what the crowd was saying, but they were aggressive and had a problem with urdu,” said mr. simon, who has been doing street art for 15 years., the situation remained tense till the police arrived at the scene and took the artists to the nearby mansarovar park police station. a police officer said the artists had permissions in writing so they were allowed to leave., “we have not registered any case. the people in the crowd were just locals, not rss activists,” said the officer from mansarovar park police station., campaign, the “delhi, i love you” movement, meant to celebrate the capital through 30 months of collaborative initiatives, had launched a project to collect “delhi stories” in september. with the help of twitter india, they collected over 8,000 stories, couplets and observations through the hashtag #mydillistory. forty of the best submissions, 10 each in english, hindi, urdu and punjabi — all official languages of delhi — were chosen to be painted on public spaces around the city. the project was in collaboration with the delhi government, which helped with permissions for the sites., since september, 10 of the tweets have been painted on walls across the city, including the wall of saket city hospital and isbt kashmere gate. a few months ago, the artists painted two urdu couplets at isbt., “we never thought anything like this would happen. since we get permissions in batches, we thought to start with an urdu one when we got the permission to paint at nine djb buildings as we had not used many of the urdu submissions,” said kush sethi, the chief digital officer of “delhi, i love you”., undeterred by the incident at shahdara, mr. sethi said though the artists will not return to the site, they will paint the same couplet at one of the other djb sites allotted for the project.",0.10374396135265701,‘heart delhi ’ find new spot,"urdu couplet lionising “heart delhi ” brighten drab government building somewhere city , locals prevented artists painting words east delhi site last week. , two artists painting couplet wall delhi jal board pumping station gt road shahdara may 20 part government-supported “delhi , love ” campaign , surrounded locals , claimed rashtriya swayamsevak sangh ( rss ) , forced erase line. , couplet question written post-graduate student delhi university , zeeshan amjad , one 40 entries chosen public art campaign launched “delhi , love ” september last. , “ dilli tera ujarna , aur phir ujar ke basna. woh dil hai toone paya , sani nahi hai jiska .

2016-06-30,panchayati raj ministry: a downgrade for democracy,"if, as >the hindu’s >exclusive on wednesday indicates, prime minister narendra modi were to close down the ministry of panchayati raj, it would confirm one’s worst fears about his government’s hypocritical approach to grass-roots democracy for grass-roots development., this was a lacuna that was evident in the ‘gujarat model’ of development long before it began being inflicted from the centre. for mr. modi was just about the only chief minister to refuse me entry to the state when, as the first ever union minister for the subject during upa-i, i was attempting to round off my visits to all states and union territories to propagate the cause and work with state governments on state-specific action to be undertaken., a de-democratising move among other initiatives we took for strengthening panchayat empowerment was the index of devolution prepared by independent experts and geared towards rewarding states that over the previous year had made the most incremental progress towards more effective devolution in terms of the constitution and their own state legislation. many states that had been slow starters, including bihar, tripura, chhattisgarh, haryana, and rajasthan, found their scores rising and were appropriately recognised. gujarat never figured because its pattern was frozen., worse, gujarat ran a system under which democracy at the village level was discouraged by financially incentivising panchayats elected without contest. rajasthan, and now haryana, have followed suit by placing regressive restrictions on less educated and poorer candidates, particularly dalit women, from even contesting panchayat elections., this de-democratisation of local self-government will be aggravated if a cabinet minister for panchayati raj is not available to advocate and promote the cause with chief ministers and his counterparts in the states. after all, the 73rd amendment, now incorporated as part ix of the constitution, is the joint responsibility of the union and the states, calling for high-level coordination to promote and protect the provisions of the longest and most detailed amendment ever carried out to the constitution. it was passed virtually unanimously in december 1992 as representing the consensus among central and state stakeholders. this consensual method must be persisted with by bringing state ministers together; convening academic experts and field-level ngos; promoting feedback from and best practices among elected panchayat representatives; monitoring the special interests of women representatives, dalits and tribals; maintaining and updating data-banks on all aspects of panchayat raj; commissioning expert studies and preparing periodic reports such as the biannual state of the panchayats reports. these are among the key activities undertaken by the ministry. providing such an all-india perspective will be seriously diluted or even entirely lost without an independent ministry for the subject., the constitutional mandate moreover, merging or subordinating panchayat raj under rural development amounts to a grossly inadequate reading of the constitution, in particular the eleventh schedule that lists the proposed jurisdiction (“powers, authority and responsibilities”) of national-level panchayati raj. while schemes of the rural development ministry, like the mahatma gandhi national rural employment guarantee scheme, rural housing, national rural livelihoods mission and the pradhan mantri gram sadak yojana, are indeed covered under more than one entry in the eleventh schedule, the range of entries covers virtually the entire gamut of development and welfare in rural india, beginning with entry 1, “agriculture, including agricultural extension”, as also “animal husbandry, dairying and poultry” (entry 4) and “fisheries” (entry 5) that are the responsibility of the agriculture ministry; “minor irrigation, water management and watershed development” (entry 3) that falls under the ministry of water resources; “social forestry and farm forestry” (entry 6) and “minor forest produce” (entry 7) that jointly concern the ministry of environment, forest and climate change and the ministry of tribal affairs. drinking water (entry 11) and sanitation (entry 23), including the much-hyped swachh bharat abhiyan, are the responsibility of the ministry of drinking water and sanitation. the eleventh schedule goes on to detail “small scale industries, including food processing industries” (entry 8) and “khadi, village and cottage industries” (entry 9), that fall respectively under the ministry of micro, small and medium enterprises, the ministry of food processing industries and the ministry of textiles., “family welfare” (entry 24) and “health, including hospitals, primary health centres and dispensaries” (entry 23) are part of the national rural health mission run by the ministry of health and family welfare; while the massive integrated child development services programme falls under “women and child development” (entry 25) that is run by the ministry of the same name. “education, including primary and secondary schools” (entry 17), “technical training and vocational education” (entry 18), “adult and non-formal education” (entry 19) and libraries (entry 20) belong to the domain of the human resource development ministry, especially the transformative sarva shiksha abhiyan, and the ministry of skill development and entrepreneurship, while “cultural activities” (entry 21) are part of the ministry of culture. “social welfare” (entry 26), “the welfare of the weaker sections, and, in particular, of the scheduled castes and the scheduled tribes” is in the jurisdiction of the ministry of social welfare and the ministry of tribal affairs. “public distribution system” (entry 28) belongs to the ministry of food and public distribution. this listing is illustrative rather than comprehensive., with such a wide constitutional remit, confining panchayati raj to just the ministry of rural development will be a conceptual infringement, an emasculation of the constitutional role envisaged for panchayati raj institutions. what the 73rd amendment sought to do was a radical reorganisation of last-mile delivery of public goods and services to the panchayats by devolving “such powers and authority as may be necessary to enable them to function as institutions of self-government” (article 243g). note, “self-government” not “self-governance”: the fundamental mandate was to establish the panchayati raj system as the third tier of government, not to make these institutions implementing agencies for state departments or union ministries. this was to be achieved by endowing these “institutions of self-government” with the required functions, finances and functionaries (the three fs)., twenty-five years of progress clearly such a revolution in political relations between elected local government authorities and the state political set-up requires time and patient experimentation to play out. the ministry of panchayati raj, set up by upa-i in 2004, has over the past 12 years or so been advocating and incentivising this. it is the primary duty of the ministry to perform these delicate advisory functions. panchayati raj remains on the state list but, in view of the 73rd constitutional amendment, the centre becomes responsible to work with the states to fulfil in letter and spirit the aims and objects of the constitutional legislation. for this revolutionary task, an independent ministry, preferably under a persuasive and influential minister, is essential. otherwise panchayati raj will wither on the vine., prime among these is “activity mapping”, that is, identifying the numerous tasks to be undertaken in planning and implementing any given scheme with a view to allocating these different activities to different tiers of the system from the central to the state government and the three separate levels of rural self-government: the village, the intermediary (taluka or block) and the district would have to be supplemented by parallel and simultaneous devolution to the appropriate tiers of finances and functionaries. to this end, the upa prime minister, through the cabinet secretary, issued directions in november 2004 and august 2013 to departmental secretaries of all ministries concerned to work on such “activity maps” for their respective centrally-sponsored schemes. this called for a systemic overhaul of district and sub-district level administration (and the politics of administering rural india) involving the effective empowerment of a whole new tribe of elected local representatives.",0.06262452824952827,panchayati raj ministry : downgrade democracy,", >the hindu ’ >exclusive wednesday indicates , prime minister narendra modi close ministry panchayati raj , would

2016-07-15,expanding the idea of india,"the constitution of india, the longest written constitution of the world, has envisaged a holistic approach towards civic life in a democratic polity. certain rights have been guaranteed within the constitution as fundamental rights. since human conduct cannot be confined to the realm of fundamental rights, the constitution has envisaged certain duties, which are correlated to the rights, and those duties have been described as fundamental duties., the framers of the constitution did not deem it appropriate to incorporate those duties in the text of the constitution when it was originally promulgated. however, the post-constitution civic life, for around a quarter century, did not portray a rosy picture, and therefore, it was thought fit to have a framework of duties in the constitution itself. it may sound paradoxical that the preparatory work for the introduction of fundamental duties by the swaran singh committee was done when the fundamental rights were under suspension during the emergency., >the full text of justice kurian joseph speech, the fundamental duties the following ten fundamental duties were introduced by the 42nd amendment act, 1976 — article 51-a: it shall be the duty of every citizen of india: to abide by the constitution and respect its ideals and institutions, the national flag and the national anthem; to cherish and follow the noble ideals which inspired our national struggle for freedom; to uphold and protect the sovereignty, unity and integrity of india; to defend the country and render national service when called upon to do so; to promote harmony and the spirit of common brotherhood amongst all people of india transcending religious, linguistic and regional or sectional diversities and to renounce practices derogatory to the dignity of women; to value and preserve the rich heritage of our composite culture; to protect and improve the natural environment including forests, lakes, rivers and wildlife and to have compassion for living creatures; to develop the scientific temper, humanism and the spirit of inquiry and reform; to safeguard public property and to abjure violence; to strive towards excellence in all spheres of individual and collective activity, so that the nation constantly rises to higher levels of endeavour and achievement. subsequently, another duty was added by the 86th constitutional amendment act of 2002: for a parent or guardian to provide opportunities for education of the child or ward between the age of six and fourteen., since then, the scope of fundamental rights under part iii of the constitution has seen significant expansion through judicial pronouncements; the right to free legal services to the poor, right to speedy trial and right to live in a clean and healthy environment are just a few examples. as a result, an imbalance has been created between the current set of fundamental rights and duties. here is an attempt to examine if a few additional fundamental duties in the constitution of this country could help in balancing out the rights of its citizens and further make them more responsible towards the country’s development., additional duties duty to vote: article 326 of the constitution read with section 62 of the representation of people’s act, 1951 confers the right to vote. however, quite often the question arises as to whether that right also implies an obligation. the voter turnout during the last general election amounted only to about 67 per cent. this voter apathy should be taken seriously and an attempt should be made to make voting a citizenship obligation., the state can take several steps to ensure that this duty to vote is made operational and effective. one method through which this may be achieved is by developing a system of incentives for voters and conversely disadvantages for those who abstain from performing their duty to vote. a very large section of people can be motivated to vote this way., duty to pay taxes: the tax gap (the revenue that a government is expected to receive as against the revenue it actually collects) continues to increase every year. the greatest indicator of this is the fact that the size of india’s shadow economy as a share of the gdp reached 24.3 per cent in the year 2012. research has found that tax evasion is a direct result of lack of trust among the people, in general, and the government, in particular. citizens must believe that their taxes are bound to be used for public good. the incorporation of the right to pay taxes as part of fundamental duties in the constitution will shift the onus onto the taxpayer to pay taxes rather than the tax department to collect them., duty to help accident victims: every 60 minutes, 16 persons die in traffic accidents in india. according to the law commission of india, at least 50 per cent of fatalities can be prevented if road accident victims receive medical attention within the critical first hour after the accident. the karnataka government’s decision to frame a ‘good samaritan law’ is a step in the right direction. with the increase in the number of accidents, it has become pertinent for india to recognise this duty as one owed by its citizens towards each other., duty to keep the premises clean: prime minister narendra modi’s swachh bharat mission has received tremendous support from people from all walks of life. the most effective mechanism to tackle uncleanliness is to sensitise people about this duty. therefore, it is imperative that a fundamental duty to this effect be added to the constitution., for a better society, duty to prevent civil wrongs: it is not enough that a citizen refrains from committing wrong; he has a duty to see that fellow citizens do not indulge in the commission of wrongs., duty to raise voice against injustice: today people seem to have stopped reacting to atrocities; they neither report crimes nor volunteer to testify in a court. the duties of a victim or a witness can be classified into two main categories, viz. duty to report a crime and duty to testify in court. the state must also on its part work to ensure that the fight to bring the offender to book does not become a kafkaesque nightmare for the victim or witness., duty to protect whistle-blowers: with the coming into force of the right to information act, 2005, every citizen has become a “potential whistle-blower”. while the state has a great deal of responsibility in providing for their protection through appropriate legislative instruments, the responsibility to protect torchbearers of transparency vests on each one of us., duty to support bona fide civil society movements: citizens have a moral duty to organise themselves or support citizen groups so that the gaps in governance left by the executive can be filled and the rights guaranteed by the constitution are made available to every citizen. therefore, it is proposed that there must be an addition to part iv-a of the constitution to that effect., reinvigorating civic responsibility: in the modern context, it has become increasingly important to instil a reinvigorated sense of civic responsibility among indian citizens. this can be achieved by adding new duties to the existing list of fundamental duties while also laying emphasis on the performance of the existing ones. the significance of fundamental duties is not diminished by the fact that there is no punishment prescribed for not following them. fundamental duties constitute the conscience of our constitution; they should be treated as constitutional values that must be propagated by all citizens.",0.18371727478870345,expanding idea india,"constitution india , longest written constitution world , envisaged holistic approach towards civic life democratic polity. certain rights guaranteed within constitution fundamental rights. since human conduct cannot confined realm fundamental rights , constitution envisaged certain duties , correlated rights , duties described fundamental duties. , framers constitution deem appropriate incorporate duties text constitution originally promulgated. however , post-constitution civic life , around quarter century , portray rosy picture , therefore , thought fit framework duties constitution itself. may sound paradoxical preparatory work introduction fundamental duties swaran singh committee done fundamental rights suspension emergency. , >the full text justice kurian joseph speech , fundamental duties following ten fundamental duties introduced 42nd amendment act , 1976 — article 51-a : shall duty every citizen india : abide constitution respect ideals institutions , national flag national anthem ;

2016-07-23,we need a nutrition mission,"the “global nutrition report 2016” once again demonstrates india’s slow overall progress in addressing chronic malnutrition, manifest in stunting (low weight for age), wasting (low weight for height), micronutrient deficiencies and over-weight. our track record in reducing the proportion of undernourished children over the past decade has been modest at best, and lags what other countries with comparable socio-economic indicators have achieved., in a ranking of countries from lowest to highest on stunting, india ranks 114 out of 132 countries, with the incidence of stunting at 38.7 per cent, compared with germany and chile at 1.3 per cent and 1.8 per cent, respectively. even bangladesh and nepal rank marginally higher than india. on wasting, india ranks 120 out of 130 countries, at 15.1 per cent, compared with australia and chile at number 1 and 2, with 0 per cent and 0.3 per cent, and south sudan at 130 with 22.7 per cent. on the prevalence of anaemia in women of reproductive age, india ranks 170 out of 185 countries at 48.1 per cent, compared with senegal which is the worst at 57.5 per cent and the u.s. which is the best at 11.9 per cent., breaking the cycle aggregate levels of undernutrition in india remain shockingly high, despite the impressive reduction in stunting in the last decade. the segments most at risk continue to be adolescent girls, women and children, and among them scheduled castes and tribes are the worst off, reflecting the insidious economic and sociocultural deprivation so prevalent in india. according to the most recent united nations population fund (unfpa) report, nearly 50 per cent of women in india are married before they turn 18, in violation of the law., the poor nutritional status of adolescent girls, combined with child marriage and multiple pregnancies even before becoming an adult, lead to another dismal fact, that 30 per cent of all children are born with low birth weight. so we add approximately seven million, potentially wasted and stunted, to our population every year! for india to be healthy and break the inter-generational cycle of malnutrition, we have to focus on the health, nutrition and social status of children, adolescent girls and women as a priority., undernutrition — both protein energy malnutrition and micronutrient deficiencies like iron deficiency anaemia — among nearly 70 per cent of school-going children challenges the capacity for physical growth and cognitive development., the past decade has seen a steady build-up of momentum around nutrition with the setting up of the sun (scaling up nutrition) secretariat in the un; the world health assembly adoption (in 2012) of the 2025 global targets for maternal, infant and young children’s nutrition, and the 2015 sustainable development goals which centre-stage the ending of all forms of malnutrition for all people by 2030, to name a few. india’s progress clearly lags behind what is needed to eliminate malnutrition by 2030., maharashtra was the first state in india to launch a nutrition mission, in 2005, followed by five other states, madhya pradesh, uttar pradesh, odisha, gujarat and karnataka, covering a total population of 300 million. in all six states the focus of the nutrition mission is inter-sectoral coordination to improve child nutrition in the first 1000 days., the problem and solution framework are correctly identified, but there are hardly any targets or financial commitments or concrete and specific programmes and processes to accomplish this goal. systemic development is a long process that requires continuity, consistency, excellence in execution and a measurement of process, output and outcome/impact metrics, and so far at least, much of this seems to be missing for converting intent to action., one of the reasons for persistent undernutrition in india, despite the creation of integrated child development services (icds) in 1975 and national coverage of the mid-day meal scheme in 1995, is that there is no structure for multi-sectoral coordination which is essential to address the inter-generational and multifaceted nature of malnutrition. the announcement therefore from the ministry of women and child development last week of plans to overhaul the icds is welcome and much needed., poor nutrition is poor economics, the need to systemically address underlying causes of malnutrition in india is an urgency that cannot be postponed for the following reasons: one, poor nutrition is poor economics. the world bank estimates that india loses 2-3 per cent of its annual gdp by way of lower productivity, the underlying cause of which is malnutrition., the ministry of finance in its economic survey 2015-16 says, “imagine the government were an investor trying to maximise india’s long-run economic growth. given constraints on fiscal space and the state’s capacity to deliver public services, where would it invest? this chapter argues that some of the highest economic returns to public investment in human capital in india lie in maternal and early-life health and nutrition interventions.”, the copenhagen consensus has identified twice several nutrition interventions as some of the most high-yielding of all possible development assessments., two, poor nutrition will fracture the dreams and aspirations of india to become a global player in manufacturing and other industries. the human dividend on which we are banking is actually a huge liability given that one out of every three children is born underweight and unable to realise the full potential for physical growth and cognitive development, leading to lower levels of productivity., three, poor nutrition is poor humanity. article 47 of the constitution mentions the “duty of the state to raise the level of nutrition and the standard of living and to improve public health. the state shall regard the raising of the level of nutrition and the standard of living of its people and the improvement of public health as among its primary duties.” we cannot have this broken promise nearly six decades after the constitution was written., harnessing positive factors, right now there is a confluence of positive factors that must be harnessed for impactful and positive transformation. several programmes already announced by the government like swachh bharat, ‘beti bachao, beti padao’, etc. are critical nutrition-sensitive factors that address hygiene, sanitation and education. for the nutrition-specific areas, india already has the infrastructure and mechanism for reaching people most at risk. these have to be urgently revamped and made more effective., the three structures that must be prioritised are: the icds, which caters to the needs of pregnant and nursing mothers and children under the age of six; the mid-day meal scheme, which directly feeds approximately 120 million schoolchildren every day; and the public distribution system, which makes available subsistence rations to above and below poverty line families. all three are also excellent platforms for public-private partnerships to improve the level and quality of service and could be considered as specific areas for collaboration in csr programmes., of these, the intent to revamp the icds has already been announced and must move into action mode quickly. this must include streamlining the work in the 1.34 million anganwadi centres by investing in training the 2.5 million workers and helpers at these centres, standardising the nutrition component of the supplementary food offered and focussing on the overall dissemination of information and education to pregnant and nursing mothers on healthy eating habits, hygiene and sanitation, etc., care india has recently created a “job aid” which is a piloted mobile application that helps anganwadi workers plan, schedule and better coordinate their work. this and other relevant applications must be disseminated quickly to enhance the productivity and effectiveness of the anganwadi workers., similarly, the mid-day meal is an excellent structure to reach 120 million children with continuity and regularity. a single intervention in that scheme to focus on nutrition in addition to food will make a critical difference. this can easily be accomplished by the addition of micronutrients to cooked food or by adding universally liked and accepted products such as milk, biscuits, etc. fortified with micronutrients as a mid-morning or afternoon snack., there is compelling evidence from around the world that large-scale food fortification is one of the best ways to address micronutrient deficiency. the standards of the cooked meal could be changed to using only fortified flour, fortified oil and iodised salt. a large number of children suffer from both insufficient calories and inadequate micronutrients. the most compelling argument for focussing on this group is that it is targeted, there is continuity and regularity and the impact of any intervention is measurable over a period of time., borrowing from best practice in countries that have made quick and significant progress in combating malnutrition, it is recommended that a nutrition mission be created to orchestrate and sequence the work both in nutrition-specific and nutrition-sensitive areas so that the impact from each of these is embedded in positive and productive outcomes. there is enough evidence from other countries, especially those which have adopted a multi-sectoral framework, that the results are tangible and specific., there are other proven interventions like large-scale food fortification (flour, oil, milk, etc. in addition to salt) that are inexpensive and effective and must be mandated into food standards., steps to change outcomes, the immediate actions to step change nutrition outcomes could be summarised as follows: one, create a nutrition secretariat as part of the prime minister’s office with responsibility for ensuring multi-sectoral alignment on priorities, sequencing and timelines. this would include both nutrition-specific and nutrition-sensitive initiatives. agree on a dashboard of nutrition metrics to be tracked, just as we track economic metrics., two, make the nodal ministries accountable for revamping the icds, mdm, pds with clear goals, timelines and resources. open these up for public-private partnerships and make these csr-eligible.",0.0927922077922078,need nutrition mission,"“global nutrition report 2016 ” demonstrates india ’

(ap photo/gautam singh) | photo credit: gautam singh , the government has plenty of schemes for slum redevelopment, but most of these are on paper. importantly, sanitation is not on the agenda., i was all of 17 when i migrated to mumbai in 1967 from kolar, karnataka. i didn’t have a purpose then; my only aim was to find bread. i often wondered why i moved to this city. when i look back, i can visualise how millions have the same problem: you don’t have anything, you look out for a metropolis, you land in mumbai., i would never have dreamt what bombay meant. it was a culture shock at various levels. to begin with, i’d never heard the word ‘slum.’ moreover, the language was alien, and we had open-air, ‘airconditioned’ toilets., a week after i landed in the city, i ended up in the thickly-populated janata colony, mankhurd. conditions were pathetic. if i needed to use the public toilet, i would have to queue for nearly 20 minutes. so i would end up squatting wherever i would find place., i was in a slum, but i had no home. in fact, i had zero liabilities and assets, no roof over my head, no roots. i would sleep anywhere., one of the good things about a slum is that no one ever chases you away from their doorstep. in the day, i would mark out a veranda where i could lay my head at night. i would pick up saris hung out to dry and use them as blankets. in the morning, i would go to the public tap, remove my clothes, bathe, dry myself with the same set of clothes and carry on with the rest of my day., the questions in my head were ceaseless: how did i fall from the frying pan into the fire? for the first time ever, i saw pavement dwellers. why did we all have to live like animals? i gradually learnt about eviction and demolition. and then about homelessness. where could one live? i figured there wasn’t much of a choice., my journey had begun; i needed to do something about all this. from then on, i have been organising people, taking up issues of slum sanitation, eviction and demolition, and trying to find solutions., it’s important for me — for all of us — to talk about our slums. there is an entire section of society living in deplorable conditions, because of which the city’s health and economy are being dragged down., the way things are, there is no collective vision; no rules either. nearly 60 per cent of mumbai lives in slums, but a good chunk of the municipal corporation’s agenda is devoted to gardens, roads, parking and so on; the slums don’t feature. in our lopsided system of political representation, slum dwellers have been relegated to a vote bank. they are patronised, and encouraged to live in deprivation., look at dharavi, for instance. the government has no policy for asia’s largest slum. in the past 15 years, there has been no development in terms of roads, drains, toilets, or common areas. the main road has seen encroachments, encouraged by a former politician., clean the city, build toilets, mumbai lets off a big stench. people call it slumbay. what are the reasons? poor sanitation and environment, contaminated drinking water and crowded conditions., even today, 40 per cent of people in mumbai don’t have access to a toilet. in dharavi, 33–35 per cent of people live in 60-sq-ft areas. we’re talking about five-member families living in that space. how can you think of having individual toilets there? the airport slum doesn’t have a single toilet. how long will this continue?, n mumbai needs sanitation that is not dependent on the sewer system alone. sewerage systems require a capital cost, which the government cannot afford. and the rehabilitation of people will cost them 100 times more than their investment in sewerage lines. nearly 65 per cent of dharavi is not covered by a sewer system. to do so, you need to rehabilitate 80 per cent of the people living here., everyone is talking about swachh bharat, but how many toilets have been constructed in slums under this project? the government could have claimed it had cleaned mumbai, so working with smaller cities would be relatively easier. you have to show what you have done in a difficult situation first., n our sanitation needs to be customised to our living and weather conditions. unlike the west, we cannot afford individual toilets or sewer lines. we have to work towards providing collective, shared and community toilets. we can achieve two agendas at one go: if the municipality invests money in a slum (in the form of toilets) it cannot demolish it., n the main focus should be on how to clean the city. without getting into the politics of it, we need to ask if a mechanism has been created for the purpose. even after we have created wards, there is nothing to show on the ground. where and how is the money being used?, n a city like mumbai should have had an ias officer as the head of sanitation. every area needs a dedicated sanitary inspector, with the additional role of mapping the area and reporting to the higher authority., alternative housing, in the 80s, there were around 600 slum pockets in the city. now it has gone up to 3,000., no one comes to mumbai for the pleasure of getting a house in a slum. they are in tough situations, therefore they migrate. we need to address the needs of those already living in slums by giving them better housing. we need to do away with the dehumanised category of ‘shanty’., former municipal commissioner s.s. tinaikar used to say, “mumbai has so much land, you can arrange to have another city like it.” land needs to be given to the people, but not for free., the development plan outlines a clear policy of homes for the dishoused. there is also a pavement policy, which former secretary, special projects, sanjay ubale and i hammered into shape. the subsequent government resolution said all pavement dwellers are eligible for a house, just like slum dwellers. i was able to secure 4,710 sq.m. land for rehabilitation in mankhurd., there are policies, but the government is sleeping on them, while the people don’t have anyone to organise them into agitating for their due., the government often says it can’t give land because it is reserved. so i tell people, let every slum- or pavement-dweller identify 10-15 pieces of land. if they say it is reserved for a university, ask for a third, a fourth, and so on. after 220 land reservations, can they still say no? there is land, only the will is missing., over a decade ago, i was working with the mmrda on the mumbai urban transport project-ii. i told the sukhtankar committee that the government could float a tender asking for free housing on the land in the project. the first housing scheme was initiated by us. all 20,000-30,000 families have been rehabilitated on it. that means the mmrda has the land and houses., the slum rehabilitation authority (sra) has failed because of corruption and mismanagement; it has become a money-making mission for the government., the first question a councillor asks these days is, “isme mera kya hai? what’s in it for me?” you have 365 cooperative housing societies built under the sra, but most of the residents have had to dedicate 20 per cent extra, or out-of-pocket expenses, like paying someone to approve a document, an extension, or adding a name to a registration. that’s why these societies have taken in only 150 families., in an sra house, you are charged more than five times what you pay in a slum for water. do you expect a rehabilitated person can pay that much? an sra home, then, is not affordable. nobody is going into why the sra scheme hasn’t picked up in mumbai, and why there are so many slums. they have set 269 sq.ft. as the base under the sra, and 300 sq.ft. in dharavi. but a political party wants 400 sq.ft. once this is done, airport slum dwellers will demand the same. this doesn’t just involve finding land; it’s also a question of rehabilitation., the government is doing nothing for affordable housing, which in any case costs rs. 5 lakh and above. besides, most ‘affordable’ homes are outside the city, or in far-flung areas; this requires the creation of a transportation network., our politicians and bureaucrats have learnt nothing from the mistakes of the sra or rehabilitation over the past 35 years. therefore, we live with myths like ‘there is no land’. to begin with, slums are on the ground level. in urban india, you cannot afford to live in a ground-floor structure, simply because the land cost is so high. you compensate for that by getting into an sra house. but if you want to live here, you have to change your living pattern. you live without a toilet for years; you don’t talk about it., i’m not asking everyone to go to an sra accommodation. regularise or recognise a slum and maintain a standard; instead of a corrupt sra society, slums could be more organised. we also need a housing guideline., other fixes, women must be at the centre, local residents, particularly women, need more representation in decision-making. for every issue, be it toilets, housing or water, women are worst affected. a man can meet his needs outside the home: he can use the toilet in his factory, or a public toilet. in most cases, women are tied to the home; their representation is token., use ngos better, today, you have more than 6,000 non-governmental organisations (ngos) registered with the charity commissioner. every ward could be allotted 10 to 15 ngos for specific issues of their choice; this will fix responsibility. the government could create that kind of flexibility, by inviting a ward’s prominent ngos to a meeting and assigning them duties. a coordinating body could be responsible for their functioning., in other words, identify the issue, then create a system and then monitor it, all within a budget., ngos, on their part, need to raise the issue of sanitation in their wards. for now, they are just “talking revolutionaries” who often don’t get down to hard work., generate debate, the government should take these issues to the people, create forums where debate can happen without fear of reprisal being targeted. right now, there is a disconnect between the grassroots and the policy-makers., what you see today is the result of the administration not looking after the city. mumbai is actually well organised, with every inch of land governed by the administration. they ought to be more in control of encroachment though., there is a hindi saying: ‘billi ki nazar chichde mein rehti hai the cat always looks for the cream’. similarly, the politician always looks at how many votes he can garner in an area. he never looks at problems like housing or a poor living environment.",0.08099738885453174,"better mumbai , fix slums first","child walks alley dharavi , asia ' largest slum , mumbai , india , wednesday , jan. 21 , 2009. golden globes winning ' slumdog millionaire ' , british-indian film mumbai slum boy ' rise game-show glory released india two languages jan. 23.

2016-08-04,the age of gst dawns,"the introduction of a >unified goods and services tax (gst) across the nation is the most important indirect tax reform since independence. it has taken almost 16 years from the date of inception of the idea, formation of a task force, to passage in parliament. it represents a herculean, nationwide, multi-party consensus-building exercise which is finally bearing fruit., the upside of gst it has huge implications. first, it addresses a serious impediment to our competitiveness. without the gst, there are multiple points of taxation, and multiple jurisdictions. we also have an imperfect system of offsetting credits on taxes paid on inputs, leading to higher costs. further there is cascading of taxes — that is, tax on tax. interstate commerce has been hampered due to the dead-weight burden on central sales tax and entry taxes, which have no offsets. all this will go once the gst is in place. it will enhance the ease of doing business, and make our producers more competitive against imports., second, the adoption of the gst is an iconic example of what prime minister narendra modi has called “cooperative federalism”. it represents a national consensus, an outcome of a grand bargain struck together by 29 states and seven union territories with the central government. the states agreed to give up their right to impose sales tax on goods (vat), and the centre gave up its right to impose excise and services tax. in exchange they will each get a share of the unified gst collected nationally. the anticipated additional gains in efficiency, competitiveness and overall tax collections are what drove this bargain., third, once the gst is in place, it means a unified, un-fragmented national market for goods and services, accessible to the smallest entrepreneur. companies need not maintain stock depots to avoid paying interstate taxes. this will free up some capital. all this will add to demand, and also efficiency. the national council for applied economic research and others have estimated that national gdp growth can go up by one percentage point on a sustained basis., fourth, because the structure of claiming input tax credit is linked to having proof of taxes paid at an earlier stage in the value chain, this creates interlocking incentives for compliance between vendor and customer. no more questions from a vendor: “would you like that with receipt or without receipt?” because of this inherent incentive, the total taxes paid, and hence collected, may go up significantly. this provides buoyancy to the gst. in fact, a significant part of the black economy will enter the tax-paid economy., the potential downside all of this constitutes the upside of adopting the gst. its roll-out represents a rare and historic political consensus. but that should not blind us to its potential downside, or the devil lurking in the details of its implementation. here are some issues to consider., first is the question of the uniform gst rate. what should it be? an early report of the finance ministry from 2003 mentioned a rate of 12 per cent. over the years this rate drifted higher, and the focal number being discussed now is 18 per cent. what determines this number?, the empowered committee of finance ministers uses a concept called “revenue neutral rate” or rnr. the rnr is that uniform rate which when applied will leave all states with the same revenue as before. so no state should lose out by signing up to the gst. but this approach is faulty, since unless we try it for a year (or more) we won’t be able to gauge the buoyancy of the gst. in trying to assuage the fears of states, the calculation of the rnr has been loaded by every possible existing tax (like entry tax, octroi, etc.). this has caused the rnr to steadily escalate upward. at one point, the national institute of public finance and policy mentioned 26 per cent. the higher the rnr (and hence gst rate), the more is its inflationary impact. this is a sure way of killing the golden egg-laying goose. a better approach is to keep the gst rate low initially, and promise to fully reimburse losing states by the end of the year. everyone may be in for a pleasant surprise by gst buoyancy. but this tax buoyancy will stop working beyond a certain threshold (like say 18 or 20 per cent). the focus on the rnr is self-defeating., taxation and litigation the second issue is that the gst is an indirect tax. by their very nature, indirect taxes are regressive because they affect the poor more than the rich. india’s ratio of indirect to direct tax collection is 65:35, which is exactly the opposite of the norm in most developed countries. india’s ratio of direct tax to gdp is one of the lowest in the world, and it badly needs to expand the direct tax net. only 4 per cent of india pays income tax, but practically all indians pay indirect taxes in one form or the other. direct tax rates have been falling, and indirect tax rates rising. for instance, service tax (an indirect tax) used to be 5 per cent in the 1990s and is now more than 15 per cent. the swachh bharat cess, or frequent increase in excise duty on petrol and diesel are all recent examples of regressive indirect tax. unless a rate cap is adopted, the gst rate could easily drift higher, further hurting india’s income inequality. to meet their fiscal needs, it is always tempting for governments to tweak indirect taxes higher, since the work of expanding the direct tax net is so much harder. this temptation must be curbed with a rate cap., the third issue is of tax litigation. approximately rs.1.5 lakh crore is stuck in litigation related to central excise and service taxes. on the other hand the state-level vat is administered in a way that empowers tax officials to dispose of cases quickly. disputes involving central taxes go though an appeal and tribunal process, and can drag on for years. but empowered staff under the sales tax commissioner can dispose of valid grievances of state-level vat payers much faster. this difference is called the “review” versus “revise” approach to tax disputes. it is important that the gst approach leans towards the more efficient state-level model.",0.1449180747567844,age gst dawns,"introduction >unified goods services tax ( gst ) across nation important indirect tax reform since independence. taken almost 16 years date inception idea , formation task force , passage parliament. represents herculean , nationwide , multi-party consensus-building exercise finally bearing fruit. , upside gst huge implications. first , addresses serious impediment competitiveness. without gst , multiple points taxation , multiple jurisdictions. also imperfect system offsetting credits taxes paid inputs , leading higher costs. cascading taxes — , tax tax. interstate commerce hampered due dead-weight burden central sales tax entry taxes , offsets. go gst place. enhance ease business , make producers competitive imports. , second , adoption gst iconic example prime minister narendra modi called “cooperative federalism ” . represents national consensus , outcome grand bargain struck together 29 states seven union territories central government. states agreed give right impose sales tax goods ( vat ) , centre gave right impose excise services tax. exchange get share unified gst collected nationally. anticipated additional gains efficiency , competitiveness overall tax collections drove bargain. , third , gst place , means unified , un-fragmented national market goods services , accessible smallest entrepreneur. companies need maintain stock depots avoid paying interstate taxes. free capital. add demand , also efficiency. national council applied economic research others estimated national gdp growth go one percentage point sustained basis. , fourth , structure claiming input tax credit linked proof taxes paid earlier stage value chain , creates interlocking incentives compliance vendor customer. questions vendor : “would like receipt without receipt ?

2016-10-08,before he became mahatma,"illustration: deepak harichandan , gandhi scholars generally see his political work in south africa (1893-1914) as but a prelude to the remarkable role he played in reshaping the politics of the indian freedom struggle. in recent years, however, a flurry of writings on gandhi, some authored by known south african scholars, has catapulted to the centre stage of gandhiana his ‘racist’ attitude towards africans and coloured people, exclusion of this segment from the political struggles that he organised, his failure to form political alliances with all oppressed people, his sexual preferences, and his imperial patriotism. how do we begin to reconcile these insights with the widely held belief in india and abroad that gandhi is a mahatma?, we can follow different paths to address this contradiction in gandhi’s thought. we can, for instance, shrug off the problem by quoting the poet walt whitman: “do i contradict myself? very well then, i contradict myself, i am vast, i contain multitudes.” gandhi certainly contained multitudes, he held odd views on social relations, his defence of the caste system is unjustifiable, and he was eccentric to a fault. but he also had an extraordinary gift for understanding the political significance of the moment, and grasping it. he lived a life of contradictions, as we all do. , alternatively, armed with numerous cups of tea as munna bhai did in the marvellous film lage raho munna bhai, we burrow into dusty volumes of his letters and writings, acknowledge he was wrong at that moment of his life, and cite him to establish self-correction in his later life. the project is tiresome but doable. thereby we follow the french marxist philosopher louis althusser, who in the 1960s pointed out an ‘epistemological break’ in marx’s thought, and distinguished between the ‘young’ and the ‘mature’ marx. we can accordingly speak of a ‘young’ and a ‘mature’ gandhi., or we can focus on the historical context of his remarks. the cambridge historian quentin skinner suggests that before we judge words spoken in the past, we must know what they signified then. in the work the prince (1513), the florentine philosopher niccolò machiavelli advises the ruler of florence, lorenzo de' medici, thus. a prince, he said, must know when not to be virtuous. for these words, machiavelli has been slammed throughout history as the teacher of evil, and as immoral for separating, as he did, ethics and politics. prof. skinner asks us to consider what virtue meant in 16th century florence. at that time virtue signified either a life devoted to reflection in the platonic sense, or a life lived in accordance with the tenets of christian morality. lorenzo de' medici, destined in machiavelli’s view to unite a fragmented and conquered italy, needed a different set of virtues. he had to possess pagan virtues of honour, valour, and courage. virtue held different implications in the public sphere compared to the private sphere. consider the time gandhi lived in settler-dominated south africa. dominant linguistic conventions sanctioned the use of derogatory terms for non-whites. indians, for instance, were called coolies. gandhi erred because he did not question a practice that violated his own understanding of what human beings are due. , does it really matter if gandhi statues and photographs are removed, if m.g. roads are renamed, or if our present government tries to depoliticise a politically subversive leader by designating october 2 as swachh bharat? gandhi, who wielded the broom with some dexterity, would not have minded. as munna bhai’s inner-self manifested as gandhi’s apparition instructs him, do all this, just keep my teachings in your heart. , but there was a time when african freedom movements drew upon gandhi; today, nationalist africans attack him. therefore, none of the paths suggested above might help us to reconcile the contradiction in gandhi’s ideas or mollify our african friends. witness the extent of anger. in june 2016 a gandhi statue was installed in the university of ghana during the visit of president pranab mukherjee. soon thereafter a number of academics, students, and artists demanded the removal of the statue. last year an online campaign ‘#ghandimustfall hashtag’ gained traction, even as his statue in johannesburg was vandalised in april during a rally against ‘gandhi the racist’. , this anger is understandable. there was a time when indian leaders were committed to solidarity with other postcolonial countries. today as indian industrialists/entrepreneurs compete with china to appropriate land and resources in sub-saharan africa, we see the rise of resentment against the new colonisers. therefore, gandhi, who inspired nelson mandela, julius nyerere, and kwame nkrumah, is now unacceptable to many africans. the exploitation of vulnerable countries by india, an emerging power, has bred a rather bitter harvest. , we can ask why something said or done a hundred years ago still has the power to evoke offence. arguably, a reinvented nationalism that has swept the world as ‘hatred of the other’ revisits the past to identify those who belong, and those who do not. in parts of africa, gandhi is clearly perceived as someone who came in from the outside, and began to mobilise an otherwise disparate community of indians: indentured labour, memon and bohra merchants locally called arabs, and other indians against discriminatory laws. he was indifferent to the plight of african and coloured people. , but that was not his project. gandhi entered south africa as an inexperienced and brief-less lawyer to assist a case involving two prominent memon traders. at that time of his life, a 24-year-old gandhi believed that the british empire would ensure the freedom of its subjects in an oppressive settler colony. he supported the british in the boer war (1899-1902), and raised a unit of stretcher bearers to accompany troops to the front. he expected the british to reciprocate by protecting indians. his hope was belied, and gandhi the imperial patriot was transformed into gandhi the leader who touched the hearts and minds of millions. he learnt the grammar of anti-colonial nationalism in exile, and amidst oppression, much as irish immigrants became fenians on american soil.

2017-01-26,president's address on the eve of republic day 2017,"fellow citizens:, 1.on the eve of the sixty-eighth republic day of our nation, i extend warm greetings to all of you in india and abroad. i convey my special greetings to members of our armed forces, para-military forces and internal security forces. i pay my tribute to the brave soldiers and security personnel who made the supreme sacrifice of their lives in defending india’s territorial integrity and maintaining law and order., , brothers and sisters:, 2.when india attained freedom on 15th august 1947, we did not have an instrument of governance of our own. we waited till 26th january, 1950 when the indian people gave to themselves a constitution to secure for all its citizens, justice, liberty, equality, and gender and economic equity. we promised to promote fraternity, dignity of the individual, and unity and integrity of the nation., on that day, we became the largest democracy of the world., , 3.the faith and commitment of people gave life to our constitution and our founding fathers, wisely and carefully, steered the new nation past its troubles of being a poor economy with huge regional imbalances and a vast citizenry deprived of even basic necessities., , 4.it goes to the credit of the strong institutions of democracy built by our founders that for the last six and a half decades, indian democracy has been an oasis of stability in the region troubled by unrest. from a population of 360 million in 1951, we are now a 1.3 billion strong nation. even then, our per capita income has shown a ten-fold increase, poverty ratio has declined by two-thirds, average life expectancy has more than doubled, and literacy rate has shown a four-fold increase. we are today the fastest growing amongst the major economies of the world. we are the second largest reservoir of scientific and technical manpower, the third largest army, the sixth member of the nuclear club, the sixth member in the race for space, and the tenth largest industrial power. from a net food grains importing country, india is now a leading exporter of food commodities. the journey so far has been eventful, sometimes painful, but most of the times, exhilarating., , 5.what has brought us thus far will take us further ahead. but we will have to learn to adjust our sails, quickly and deftly, to the winds of change. evolutionary and incremental growth will have to accommodate rapid disruptions brought in by advances of science and technology. innovation, more so inclusive innovation, will have to become a way of life. education will have to keep pace with technology. in the race between man and machine, the winner will have to be job generation. the velocity of technology adoption will call for a workforce that is willing to learn and adapt. our education system will have to join hands with innovation to prepare our youth for life-long learning., , fellow citizens:, 6.our economy has been performing well despite the challenging global economic conditions. in the first half of 2016-17, it grew at a rate of 7.2 percent – same as that last year – showing sustained recovery. we are firmly on the path of fiscal consolidation and our inflation level is within comfort zone. though our exports are yet to pick up, we have managed a stable external sector with sizeable foreign exchange reserves., , 7.demonetization, while immobilizing black money and fighting corruption, may have led to temporary slowdown of economic activity. as more and more transactions become cashless, it will improve the transparency of the economy., brothers and sisters:, , 8.born in independent india, three generations of citizens do not carry the baggage of colonial past. these generations have had the privilege of acquiring education, pursuing opportunities and chasing dreams in a free nation. this sometimes makes it easy for them to take freedom for granted; to forget the price that extraordinary men and women paid to win this freedom; to forget that the tree of freedom needs constant care and nourishment. democracy has conferred rights on each one of us. but along with these rights, come responsibilities which have to be discharged. gandhiji said and i quote: ""the highest form of freedom carries with it the greatest measure of discipline and humility. freedom that comes from discipline and humility cannot be denied; unbridled license is a sign of vulgarity injurious alike to self and others” (unquote)., , fellow citizens:, 9.youth today are brimming with hope and aspirations. they pursue their life goals, which they perceive will bring them fame, success and happiness, with single-minded devotion. they consider happiness as their existential objective, which of course is understandable. they search for happiness in the highs and lows of day-to-day emotions, and in the fulfilment of the objectives they have set for themselves. they look for a job as well as a purpose in life. lack of opportunities leads to frustration and unhappiness which manifests itself in anger, anxiety, stress and aberrations in behaviour. this has to be dealt with by inculcating pro-social behaviour through gainful employment, active engagement with community, parental guidance, and empathetic response from a caring society., brothers and sisters:, , 10.one of my predecessors left on my table a framed quotation which reads (and i quote): ""the object of government in peace and in war is not the glory of rulers or races but the happiness of the common man” (unquote). happiness is fundamental to the human experience of life. happiness is equally the outcome of economic and non-economic parameters. the quest for happiness is closely tied to sustainable development, which combines human well-being, social inclusion and environmental sustainability. we must make happiness and well-being of our people as the touchstones of public policy., , 11.many of the flagship initiatives of the government have been designed to promote the well-being of the society. the swachh bharat mission aims at a clean india by 2nd october, 2019 to coincide with the 150th birth anniversary of gandhiji. increased spending on programmes like mgnrega is enhancing employment generation to rejuvenate the rural economy. aadhaar, with its present reach of over 110 crore people, is helping in direct transfer of benefits, plugging leakages and improving transparency. the digital india programme is creating a knowledge economy through universal provision of digital infrastructure and platforms for cashless economic transactions. initiatives like start-up india and atal innovation mission are fostering innovation and new-age entrepreneurship. under the skill india initiative, the national skill development mission is working on skilling 300 million youth by 2022., , brothers and sisters:, 12.it is my firm conviction that india’s pluralism and her social, cultural, linguistic and religious diversity are our greatest strength. our tradition has always celebrated the ‘argumentative’ indian; not the ‘intolerant’ indian. multiple views, thoughts and philosophies have competed with each other peacefully for centuries in our country. a wise and discerning mind is necessary for democracy to flourish. more than the unison of ideas, a healthy democracy calls for conformity to the values of tolerance, patience and respect for others. these values must reside in the hearts and minds of every indian; inculcating in them a temperament of understanding and responsibility., , fellow citizens:, 13.we have a noisy democracy. yet, we need more and not less of democracy. the strength of our democracy is evidenced by the fact that over 66 percent of the total electorate of 834 million voted in the 2014 general elections. the depth and breadth of our democracy sparkles in the regular elections being held in our panchayati raj institutions. and yet, our legislatures lose sessions to disruptions when they should be debating and legislating on issues of importance. collective efforts must be made to bring the focus back to debate, discussion and decision-making., , 14.as our republic enters her sixty-eighth year, we must acknowledge that our systems are not perfect. the imperfections have to be recognized and rectified. the settled complacencies have to be questioned. the edifice of trust has to be strengthened. the time is also ripe for a constructive debate on electoral reforms and a return to the practice of the early decades after independence when elections to lok sabha and state assemblies were held simultaneously. it is for the election commission to take this exercise forward in consultation with political parties., , fellow citizens:, 15.in a fiercely competitive world, we have to work harder than ever to redeem the promises that we make to our people., , - we have to work harder because our war on poverty is not yet over. our economy is yet to grow at over 10 percent for an extended period of time to make a significant dent on poverty. one-fifth of our countrymen still remain below poverty line. gandhiji’s mission to wipe every tear from every eye still remains unfulfilled., , - we have to work harder to provide food security to our people and to make the agriculture sector resilient to the vagaries of nature. we have to provide better amenities and opportunities to our people in villages to ensure a decent quality of life., , - we have to work harder to provide enhanced employment opportunities to our youth through the creation of world-class manufacturing and services sectors. the competitiveness of the domestic industry has to be improved by focusing on quality, productivity and efficiency., , - we have to work harder to provide safety and security to our women and children. women must be able to lead their lives with honour and dignity. children must be able to enjoy their childhood to the fullest., , - we have to work harder to change our consumption pattern which has resulted in environmental and ecological de-gradation. we have to appease nature to prevent it from unleashing its fury in the form of floods, landslides and droughts., , - we have to work harder because our pluralistic culture and tolerance are still being put to test by vested interests. reason and moderation should be our guide in dealing with such situations., , - we have to work harder to keep at bay the dark forces of terrorism. these forces have to be dealt with firmly and decisively. the forces inimical to our interests cannot be allowed to grow., , - we have to work harder to ensure the well-being of our soldiers and security personnel who protect us from internal and external threats.,

2017-01-26,heed this 67-year-old tryst,"illustration: surendra , dear prime minister, warmest greetings to you on republic day., you were born the same year as our republic was. so, as the republic turns 67, you do too. twinned, by birth, to the constitution, you have with it another bond. as prime minister of india you have taken an oath, in the name of god, to ‘bear true faith and allegiance to the constitution of india’. and from that great position, you have called it india’s holy book. you are therefore, a constitution-person twice over, by birth and by oath., two and a half years after taking that oath, on this anniversary day, how do you see yourself in that bond?, you could, of course, say, “ask the people of india, they will tell you if i have or have not been true to it.” if i were to do that, i know, there would be a torrent of appreciation for you. not just the appreciation of your admirers but appreciation from objective observers as well., no one can deny the fact that between 2014 and 2017 your appeal has grown. it has grown for three reasons. first, you have been seen as decisive, a ‘doer’. second, you are perceived as having ‘taken on’ corruption. third, you are regarded as being tough, tougher than all your predecessors, on terror. there is a fourth image that must also be placed on the table, though it is not exactly complimentary. you are believed to be clever, hushiar. and your ‘at midnight tonight’ announcement on demonetisation has been seen as hushiari.“good for the country, no?” people said while queueing up the next morning in front of atms., but does being all those three — decisive, hard on corruption, tough on terror — translate into ‘bearing true faith and allegiance to the constitution’? today, on republic day, it is important that we reflect on that question., prime minister indira gandhi was a decisive woman. between 1975 and 1977 she was even more decisive than her usual decisive self. having declared a national emergency, she came down with an iron hand on people she portrayed as criminals, black-marketers, hoarders, corrupt. and terrorism, as we now know it, was absent during that period. but was indira gandhi true to her oath? you were 25 years old at the time, mr. prime minister. you will remember how when she reneged on the constitution, betrayed her oath, she was thrown out of power — lock, stock and barrel., indira was not india. no prime minister can be india. india alone is india., an impression prevails that you want to be seen as india, that criticism of you therefore amounts to criticism of india, tantamount to treason. questioning demonetisation becomes, in one flowing sequence, validating black money, going soft on terror and questioning your judgment — all anti-national. an immaculacy surrounds you, an assumption of infallibility imbues your pronouncements. and hence an aura of unquestionability., no one who is accountable to parliament, which represents all the people of india, can be a dictator or even a supremacist in the sense in which the word is normally used for one who wants to establish the superiority of a particular ethnicity, class or culture. but, mr. prime minister, you are a supremacist for your vision of india. you want your india, the india you are prime minister of, to do things that will be hailed as exceptional, unprecedented, unparalleled. you want india to reach, go beyond, mars, an indian land on the moon. you want to send more indian missiles hissing into the light blue skies than your predecessors did, more indian submarines to plumb noiselessly into the deep blue sea than your predecessors would have dreamt of. there is, at one level, something quite natural and admirable about a prime minister being ambitious for his or her country, to think big, bigger, biggest for his or her people. except when a nation’s leader believes in personal supremacism., sardar patel was not such a supremacist. he was a supreme realist., while supremacists love their own very particular crowds and those crowds love them, they are, as persons, very lonely. and loneliness finds two friends: secrecy and arbitrariness. a mist of trail-less circumstances surrounds a supremacist’s decisions. and these decisions come to be taken impulsively, whimsically. sometimes they can be inspired, but on most occasions they create more problems than they solve and can also cause havoc. isolated power is isolated from the advantages of consultation, from the benefit of an equal colleagueship. it is isolated, therefore, from the great bonus of republican partnership. so fond does he become of the dulcet tones of his own voice, that his auditory powers atrophy. even when he seems to be listening to others, the personal supremacist is, in fact, listening to his own voice reacting to what he is hearing. he is his own singer, his own song and his own listener. the self-centrism of an elected leader is, in democratic terms, an irony. in republican terms, an anomaly. it scarred the period 1975-1977. it must not, in the same or modified form, in de jure fact or in de facto spirit, be readmitted into our polity, our political culture., there are signs of it wanting to., abolishing the union planning commission, replacing independent heads of autonomous academic institutions by persons of known bias, the stalling of judges’ appointments, the superseding of generals in army promotions, of diplomats and bureaucrats in other elevations, the dangling in the air of the lokpal, the undermining of the rti act, blacklisting ngos, demonetisation, all come from the conviction,‘i am the alpha and the omega, the indus and the ganga’ of india. that, mr. prime minister, is an uninsured journey into great unknowns on a gilded ratha with mini-supremacists scrambling atop it., a political leader may, for all his egotism, be highly knowledgeable about certain things on his home ground. much more so than, for instance, his officers. no diplomat could have matched jawaharlal nehru’s understanding of international affairs. no officer, ics, ias, ips, could have matched patel’s knowledge of political psychology, chief minister pant’s understanding of rural politics, chief minister namboodiripad’s sense of rural and urban economics, chief minister kamaraj’s mastery of tamil nadu’s complex politics. but there are areas where others, experts, officers and ngos, know better, remember more than a politician. as, for instance, in fiscal planning, foreign relations, defence strategy, science and environment policy and, above all, in ‘real-life’ issues like unofficial ‘official’ extortions, job insecurity, health non-coverage, the absence of insurance and pension cover. the deference by non-expertise to experience becomes a leader., you advise us to do with less and less of cash. are you teaching us how to do with less and less of water? let atms run out of money, use cards, you tell us, use digi-dhan. what about when our lakes go dry? can we live with digi-jal? you are not warning the country of the known and unknown horrors of climate change, the power and fuel crises that await us, the pandemics, air-borne, water-borne and vector-borne, that are whirling overhead. you are telling us to be swachh but what of that behemoth source of aswachhata, our plastic lobby? you are teaching us the merits of yoga, but you are not disabling the fountainheads of ill-being in our gutka lobby, tobacco lobby. the control over our land commons, mines, forests by mafiosi, middlemen and mega ‘developers’ continues unchallenged., and then, there is kashmir. the team which, led by yashwant sinha and catalysed by wajahat habibullah, went to the valley has made searingly honest findings, vital recommendations. heed, mr. prime minister, their clear voice. had jayaprakash narayan’s warnings and guidance been heeded in the 1960s, kashmir would have been spared the agonies it is going through today. the constitution has not intended that part of our country for ceaseless bloodletting. history is giving us another chance for a bold new initiative that makes the most beautiful part of our nation its most peaceful., i said at the start that your appeal has grown. so has, in typical indian contrariness, your dis-appeal. those who believe in the core values of our constitution, though they are not bound to it by birth or oath, are deeply disturbed, dismayed, by the growing intolerance of dissent and the misrepresentation of criticism as anti-national.",0.16233841241266986,heed 67-year-old tryst,"illustration : surendra , dear prime minister , warmest greetings republic day. , born year republic was. , republic turns 67 , too. twinned , birth , constitution , another bond. prime minister india taken oath , name god , ‘bear true faith allegiance constitution india ’ . great position , called india ’ holy book. therefore , constitution-person twice , birth oath. , two half years taking oath , anniversary day , see bond?

black money and corruption, is remarkable. the same spirit has driven the lpg ''give it up campaign."" over 1.2 crore consumers have voluntarily given up their lpg subsidy, which has helped the

inducted in combat streams of our armed forces. the nation is proud of its first three women fighter pilots. this reminds us of what we can achieve, as a nation, if women are fully empowered, and if their skills and talent are optimally utilised., 23. the beti bachao beti padhao scheme that addresses the issue of declining child sex ratio, is yielding encouraging results. under thesukanya

our greatest strength and yuva urja needs to be effectively channelised. with the motto of ""har haath ko hunar”, my government has taken several steps for skilling the youth and improving their employability. the work of skill development, that was earlier spread across 21 ministries and 50 departments, has been brought under one umbrella ministry. the pradhan mantri kaushal vikas yojana has

over 1.1 crore jobs, mostly for women., honourable members,, 27. shram-eva jayate (श्रमेव जयते) is one of the foremost guiding principles of my government and several measures have been taken for the welfare of the shramik. for the first time ever, minimum wages have been increased by 42 percent in both agricultural and non-agricultural sectors. for bonus coverage, the calculation ceiling limit has been doubled to rs. seven thousand, and the eligibility limit increased from rs. ten thousand to rs. twenty one thousand. this will directly benefit an additional 55 lakh workers. the universal

2017-03-16,gst laws ready for assemblies ,"the goods and services tax (gst) council has approved a 15% ceiling on the cess to be levied on aerated drinks and luxury cars over and above the maximum proposed gst rate of 28%. the enabling laws for state and union territories were also approved at the council’s meeting on thursday, paving the way for the adoption of the new indirect tax regime., while bidis have been kept out of the gst net, separate cess ceilings have been approved for pan masala and tobacco products, including chewing tobacco and cigarettes — keeping adequate provision to raise the effective rate from their existing levels., with the council having already cleared three other gst laws — pertaining to central gst, integrated gst and the compensation to be paid to states for loss of revenue — this paves the way for the centre and the states to pilot the new indirect tax system, proposed to be introduced from july 1, through parliament and the assemblies., “four of these laws have to be cleared by the centre in parliament, and will now be taken up by the union cabinet for their introduction and passage. we will try and do that expeditiously, and am sure that states would also try to expedite the state gst law by getting their respective cabinets to approve them,” finance, defence and corporate affairs minister arun jaitley said after the meeting. , apart from zero-rated goods, four tax rates of 5%, 12%, 18% and 28% have been proposed under the gst. the council on thursday approved the ceiling rates for the cess to be levied on top of the maximum gst rate of 28% on demerit or sin goods., “the cess is to be levied on four or five commodities and the caps have been approved by the council. for instance, the council has approved a cap of 15% cess on luxury cars, but that is only for empowerment. these cars are currently taxed at 40%, so the cess may only be around 12%,” the minister said., a similar 15% cess cap has been approved for aerated drinks as well, and revenue secretary hasmukh adhia said that any other item that the council decides to bring into the remit of the cess subsequently would attract the same ceiling rate of 15%. the environment cess on coal, lignite and peat has been capped at the existing rate of rs 400 per tonne., for pan masala, which currently face an effective tax rate of about 135%, the ceiling on cess has been kept at 135% on an ad valorem basis (value of the product). for cigarettes, which currently face a specific duty of rs 4,170 for every 1,000 sticks apart from vat and other taxes, the ceiling has been kept at 4,170 for every 1,000 sticks and 290% on an ad valorem basis, with the option to levy a combination of both. , pratik jain, indirect tax leader at pwc india said that industry still awaits clarity as to whether some of the existing cesses such as swachh bharat cess will continue to operate. , by the next weekend, officials are also expected to finalise four pending draft regulations relating to issues such as valuation under the gst regime, which will then be taken up by the gst council at its thirteenth meeting on march 31 in the capital, the minister said. five sets of regulations relating to payments and other issues have already been approved by the council., “after these rules are approved, one major action remains – the fitment of various commodities into different tax slabs which we will strive to do in the council meeting thereafter. once that is done, we will be ready to implement gst,” the minister said, expressing hope that the fitment of gst rates to products will be taken up immediately after march 31 to enable enough buffer time to stick to the ‘tentative rollout date of july 1.’ , “clearance of the model gst law is a warning bell for

2017-03-31,it’s time for africa ,"after a teenage boy went missing in greater noida on march 26, locals accused five nigerian students of cannibalism. residents of the enclave barged into the home where the nigerian students were staying and searched the fridge for the remains of the youth, who died in a hospital after being found in a nearby park. following unsubstantiated complaints from the victim’s family, the police charged the students with murder but did not detain them for lack of evidence. it was later reported that the boy died of drug overdose. this incident, followed by further violence against african students in noida, marks a new low in the racism faced by africans in india., this vicious race crime is a clear sign of terrible ignorance, arrogance and the recycling of old tropes of africans as “uncivilised”. indians, with their preference for “whiteness” and their total lack of information and exposure to africa’s rich cultural heritage and its contemporary politics, have denied africans in india their basic humanity which is demonstrated in their accusations of “cannibalism” — the ultimate denouncement of the “inhuman other”., there have been several atrocious cases of racism in the last year towards africans in india. masonda ketada olivier, a young congolese man who was a french teacher in south extension, was murdered while returning home from a party when he tried to get an autorickshaw home and got into an argument with three men who wanted to hire the vehicle. he was brutally pulled out of the auto, assaulted, and struck on the head with a stone. he was rushed to the aiims trauma centre but was pronounced dead on arrival., also readattack on nigerians puts greater noida on alert , attack on nigerians puts greater noida on alert , the aggravated hate crimes against africans are not limited to delhi and its environs. three months before the olivier tragedy, a 21-year-old tanzanian woman was driving in bengaluru when a mob stopped the car, dragged her out, beat her and stripped off her shirt. local papers reported that the police stood by while she was beaten and paraded around naked. the car was set ablaze., apparently the young tanzanian student was beaten to avenge the death of a woman who had allegedly been run over by a sudanese man less than an hour before the attack. the student pleaded with the police for help insisting she had nothing to do with the fatal accident. in her filed complaint, she alleged that a policeman told her: “you all look alike and you should get the black man who ran over a woman in the area.”, while these monstrous incidents hit the headlines, africans in india face everyday racism that makes them feel very unsafe. the attitude of the police reflects and exacerbates this racial violence and discrimination. african students are mostly left to protest the hate crimes, and the government, keen to placate the african governments, offers the obligatory sorry and promises to look into the incident and bring about justice. however, no serious attempts to address racism towards africans in india have been undertaken., there were 42,420 foreign students in india in 2016. the top sending countries were nepal (21.3%), afghanistan (10.3%), bhutan, (6.6%), sudan (4.8%), nigeria (4.7%), indicating that after the three saarc partner countries, sudan and nigeria send the most students to study in india. students come from many african countries to india as many universities offer quality education in english that is much more reasonably priced than in the west. the university of mysore, for instance, has 2,000 foreign students, many from african countries., thus indian students have an opportunity to meet african students and learn about a part of the world of which they know little. this is despite the fact that india has had trading connections with africa over the centuries and many people of indian descent live and have lived in africa for centuries., nana peasah, a ghanaian student, has returned recently to accra after studying at the university of mysore for two years. he was the international students’ co-coordinator at the university in 2015-16. he sought to learn about india and joined the rotary club east of mysore. he also attended the destiny international church, a pentecostal church, where many international students are made to feel welcome. while mr. peasah had a lot of foreign student friends from around the world, it was harder to make friends with indian students. to make friends with women students was almost impossible, as indian men were quick to accuse africans of making advances at ‘their’ women even if they were merely studying together., also readthe gaze says it all , the gaze says it all, concerned by the racism faced by many african students, mr. peasah helped organise a peace march to raise awareness about racism in india. he also helped launch a campaign to clean rajkumar park to show that

2017-05-05,tamil nadu cities slip in swachh ranking,"tiruchi is the only city from the state to gure in the top ten in the swachh survekshan 2017 ranking, but slipped from third to sixth position. , the swachh survekshan 2017 ranking, released for 434 towns and cities across the country by the union ministry of urban development on thursday, has not brought cheer to tamil nadu. while coimbatore has moved a couple of notches up to 16, tiruchi has slipped to sixth position from third. the city had stood second in 2015. , madurai is ranked 57, down from the previous year’s 26, and greater chennai plummeted to 235, from 36. against four in 2016, 28 towns and cities from tamil nadu participated in the survey this year. the highest rank of six has gone to tiruchi, while rameswaram is ranked 268, the lowest among cities in the state., tiruchi is the only city from tamil nadu to figure in the top ten, scoring 1,716 out of 2,000 points. it secured 728 points more than the national average of 988 and 536 more than the state average of 1180. coimbatore scored 1,650 points, against the previous year’s 1,361. tiruchi scored well in four categories — citizen feedback, onsite observation, open defecation free/toilets, and capacity building initiatives. its score was low in solid waste collection and transportation, solid waste processing and disposal, and municipal self-declaration. officials in coimbatore said that however high the corporation rated its service level, it was not able to get a positive response from the people. around 50% of respondents were unhappy with its solid waste management., officials do not want to look at the ranking as a reflection of their commitment. in 2016, 73 towns and cities were ranked while the number swelled to 434 in 2017. “we feel happy. we have lost the first place to indore by just 91 points. if we had done well in citizen feedback, tiruchi would have emerged on top,” said n. ravichandran, tiruchi corporation commissioner. this year, cities with over one lakh population had been included in the survey. this meant more competition from cities with fewer people and lesser waste, said coimbatore commissioner k. vijayakarthikeyan. “when compared to last year, we have improved this time. we shall work hard to get into the top 10,” said sandeep nanduri, madurai commissioner., an apparent let-up in attending to solid waste management proved costly for salem, which is ranked 135. the low ranking requires the corporation to calibrate its strategy accordingly, say ngos. salem corporation does not have a proper garbage disposal system. it has proposed to construct a garbage processing unit and four pre-processing units as well as buy adequate dustbins, pushcarts, compactors etc. failure to effectively implement anti-plastic drive has chocked drains., there are others who are disappointed at the ranking. officials of tirunelveli corporation, who implemented a novel system of plastic waste collection, only on wednesdays, and facilitated conversion of degradable waste into manure, could not understand why it was ranked 193. rank 108 is a disappointment for vellore. an official observed that they expected to stand in the top 50. “what is lacking in vellore is citizen involvement. we do not get views or comments from the public,” he said. , the case of greater chennai corporation, which is ranked 235 owing to inadequate waste collection, lack of scientific solid waste processing, delay in construction of toilets and poor communication to bring about behaviour change, is different. , “the team visited the city a few days after cyclone vardah. everything was in shambles. so our ranking dipped,” said an official. many of the markets, places of worship and public places, including the marina, were not clean during the visit of the team. chennai received a score of 916 out of 2000., according to data from the chennai corporation, 571 of the 866 toilets were damaged during the visit of the team. the civic body prepared estimates for restoration of toilets at ₹5.71 crore but just 47 were repaired and most of them were not clean, leading to a poor score. officials

2017-07-04,removing the dark spots,"like in all metros, garbage is a major challenge in bengaluru too. even as concerned agencies continue to grapple with it, few community-led private initiatives trying to resolve the issue have come up on the horizon. in bengaluru, youth for parivartan (yfp) was born two months before swachh bharat abhiyaan came into force to deal with mounting garbage issues in the city., amit amarnath, a resident of banashankari ii stage, had for long seen a park in the vicinity turned into a garbage dump. children didn’t have any place to play and neighbours complained. but, nobody did anything until one day in june 2014, when amit and his friends restored the park back to its glory. that is when yfpwas born. today it has about 1,000 members who lead cleanliness initiatives across the city. they fix black spots which could be beneath a flyover, a wall spoilt with urination, parks and corners turned into garbage dumps. the volunteers clean up the place, beautify it and if the space permits, even construct a bench of cement and bricks., if you come across terracotta painted walls with beautiful trees and other imageries painted in warli art anywhere in the city, know that yfp is behind it. “we have observed that if you beautify a space, people don’t dirty it and that is what we work around with,” says koushik dhayal, a student, who is the brain behind the warli paintings adorning walls., till now, the outfit comprising students and professionals, has undertaken 94 spot fixes. “people also call up and inform and at times, if we come across something, we take it up,” says shravani, a core team member of yfp. while the attitude of people is changing now, it was not easy to deal with in the beginning. “i think swachh bharat abhiyaan helped a lot in this direction. people became positive and encouraging towards us. in fact, now they try to help us,” adds pratham, another core team member of yfp., the sites cleaned up by the outfit hardly get dirty again reveals koushik. “our success rate is 80-90%. and it is because the community takes interest in it and is able to sustain,” he notes., but still every spot is not exactly a cakewalk, like the mysore bank circle. it took them around three visits to ensure that the place remains filth free. “urination was a serious problem there. we washed the whole place and then painted but it didn’t work and the problem persisted. then we painted the karnataka flag but even then it continued. and recently, we painted portraits of rajkumar and br ambedkar and the problem has stopped,” quips pratham adding that after a while bbmp has now even installed dustbins at the location., the members revisit the spot 10 days after fixing it. a huge effort went into fixing the national college flyover. about 250-300 members worked for 12 hours to remove the numerous posters and then painted it. how it works is that the team members first visit the spot, evaluate it, fix a date or time on

and pedestrians for destination-based information in the capital. the 24-year-old, who has been driving at least 20 km daily for the past five years, cannot recall the last time he looked at road signage for directions or information., “road signage is either hidden behind dense foliage, obscured behind poles/ wires or mounted at places not easily visible. this, especially in case of signage on speed limit. my licence once got suspended for three months for driving 10 km per hour over the speed limit. at that point, i had been driving on that road for nearly one year. i never spotted any speed limit signage before or after i was penalised. most signage exist because they must and exist without application of mind,” he said., however, woes regarding road signage may come to an end by this new year’s eve, thanks to lieutenant-governor anil baijal’s directions to road-owning agencies to overhaul the existing network of road signage in the capital., spot the difference: a speed-limit sign in a blue square at kirti nagar in west delhi. , the public works department (pwd) and civic agencies, including the municipal corporations of delhi, have been given a seemingly ambitious deadline to standardise the road signage that have remained more or less unchanged for close to a decade., the pwd and civic agencies have been directed to oversee and complete a pan-city road signage maintenance, rectification and installation exercise, last taken up in the run up to the 2010 commonwealth games, by the end of the year., “a survey to ascertain lacunae in road signage already installed on delhi roads, irrespective of jurisdiction of land-owning agencies, is underway for the first time since the commonwealth games. not just the survey, but installation of new and maintenance of existing road signs is being taken up simultaneously since we do not want to waste time waiting for the survey results. mr. baijal has set december 31 as the deadline for completion of the exercise,” said a delhi government source., according to the source, apart from installation of both indicative and warning signs where none exist, new boards displaying the identity and contact details of local councillors and mlas will also be part of the exercise. efforts are underway to audit the correctness of road details and spelling mistakes in road signs employing languages other than english, such as hindi and urdu., spot the difference: a speed-limit sign set inside a yellow square on rafi marg in central delhi , over 70% of road signage, traffic signals and road markings in the city do not follow the prescribed norms, a study released on june 28 by the institute of road traffic education (irte) revealed., as per the delhi government records, the total road network in 2015-16 comprised 33,868 lane km. as many as six agencies are responsible for maintaining the capital’s ever-expanding road network. this network is divided into jurisdictions of the pwd, which has 1,280 km; the south delhi municipal corporation’s 9,408 km; the east delhi civic body’s 270 km; the north delhi civic body’s 3,118 km; the new delhi municipal council’s 1,290 km; national highways with 430 km; the dsiidc’s 1,434 km; the delhi development authority’s 435 km; other roads which comprise 6,308 km; and land belonging to other agencies., while the pwd is responsible for roads over 60-metre in width, roads less than 60-m wide broadly fall under the jurisdictions of the civic bodies; other land-owning agencies have different patterns of road ownership depending on notified demarcation., the study, released by irte president rohit baluja, showed that of 1,514 signage examined across 14 major stretches in delhi, 1,098 did not meet the standards prescribed by the indian road congress (irc)., , the study revealed that around 93% of regulatory signage, which are meant to be mandatorily followed, violated the prescribed standards of size, installation and shape. the study also found problems with placement, design and colours of signage in case of blue-coloured signage, which are to be used for compulsory messages, and red ones, which are to be used as prohibitory signs. some prohibitory signs were found cased in blue or yellow boards as “beautification objects”., “soon after the study was released, the same presentation was made to senior pwd officials as per a request by the latter. the signage, which was categorised as wrong by the study, includes mainly those which had caution and other warning signs in blue rectangular boards. while some may need to be rectified, a majority comply with prescribed norms,” contended a senior government official., according to a senior municipal official, the l-g had a month ago ordered review of areas under their jurisdiction where road signage need to be put up. after the final order, a detailed report would be submitted to raj niwas by all three corporations., on the eve of independence day, mr. baijal had in a meeting convened to review the functioning of the municipal corporations and progress under the swachh bharat abhiyan directed the commissioners of each civic body to install sign boards specifying details of the officer responsible for maintenance of each street to enable creation of a public interface between them and local residents for redressal of issues related to their upkeep., at a similar meet held this past week, the same instructions were given to representatives of government departments., “the l-g emphasised that the pwd must take up the same exercise of displaying the identities and contact details of pwd officials responsible for maintenance of roads under its jurisdiction,” said an officer who was part of the review., one of the issues that has been identified so far by the corporations is overlapping of authority at intersections where minor roads meet main roads. according to guidelines, warning signs are supposed to be installed to aid commuters’ safety at such points to warn them of oncoming traffic in case of arterial roads such as ring road and outer ring road., united kingdom, there are three basic types of road signage: signs that give orders, signs that warn and signs that give information. each type has a different shape. a further guide to the function of a sign is its colour. all triangular signs are red. blue circles generally give a mandatory instruction, such as ‘turn left’, or indicate a route available only to particular classes of traffic, e.g. buses and cycles. only red rings or circles tell you what you must not do, e.g. ‘you must not exceed 30 mph’ or ‘no vehicles over the height shown may proceed’., blue rectangles are used for information signs except on motorways where blue is used for direction signs.green rectangles are used for direction signs on primary routes. white rectangles are used for direction signs on non-primary routes, or for plates used in combination with warning and regulatory signs. there are a few exceptions to the shape and colour rules, to give certain signs greater prominence. examples are the ‘stop’ and ‘give way’ signs. the words ‘must’ or ‘must not’, when used in the descriptions that follow, refer to legal requirements that have to be obeyed., source: uk government site, , the netherlands, the road signs of the netherlands are regulated in the reglement verkeersregels en verkeerstekens (rvv), 1990. road users are required to observe all road signs giving orders or containing prohibitions. traffic symbols have priority over traffic rules, inasmuch as such rules are incompatible with said symbols. , temporary traffic symbols on the road surface have priority over other traffic symbols applied in that location to the road surface, inasmuch as such traffic symbols are incompatible. where traffic symbols indicating a maximum speed indicate a speed higher than those set out in other manuals, the lowest maximum speed indicated applies. if both traffic symbols on signs and electronic signal panels indicate a maximum speed, the lowest maximum speed indicated applies. traffic lights take precedence over any road signs that govern priority. traffic signs may be represented on an electronic signal panel., source: road traffic signs and regulations in the netherlands, , israel, road signs in israel are decided by the ministry of transportation. they generally use the same pattern of colours, shapes, and symbols as used in europe and set out in the vienna convention on road signs and signals. signs are written in hebrew and arabic, the two official language, and english. the ‘stop’ signs, however, convey their meaning through the depiction of a raised hand. with the exception of the special shapes used for ‘stop’ and ‘yield’ signs (an octagon and a downward-pointing triangle, respectively), signs giving orders are circular and are of two kinds: prohibitory signs (e.g. ‘no left turn’) take the form of a black-on-white symbol inside a red-bordered circle. mandatory signs (e.g. ‘turn right only’) bear a white symbol on a blue disk., source: traffic sign sheet, ministry of transportation, july 2012, , united states, regulatory signs give instructions to motorists, pedestrians, and cyclists. signs such as ‘stop’, ‘no parking’, ‘no turns’, and ‘yield’ are considered regulatory signs. some have special shapes, such as the octagon for the ‘stop’ sign and the x-shape for railroad crossings. some signs can be localised, such as ‘no parking’, and some are only found in state and local jurisdictions as they are based on state or local laws, such as new york city’s ‘don’t block the box’ signs. these signs are in the r-series of signs in the manual on uniform traffic control devices (mutcd) and typically in the r-series in most state supplements or state mutcds. there are over 16 series of regulatory sign and 25 series of warning signs.",0.07066966335432248,signs change come

2017-09-07,"gender, re-imagined ","gender bender 2017, a joint project between sandbox collective and goethe-institut/max mueller bhavan, co-curated by the ladies finger, will be held on september 9 and 10 at goethe-insitut. the grantees speak about their works. , sukriti sureka, i am from muzaffarpur in bihar and currently living in mumbai. i am a self-taught artist/painter. i am presenting an art installation, “berang se rang” is an art installation of madhubani paintings on a small hut. it’s a simple and small hut, similar to many seen all over india. on the outside it is in the process of being decorated with madhubani painting. on the inside, it showcases a series of madhubani paintings which depict several forms in which women face bias and discrimination on the basis of their gender. the paintings are done by various artists, including myself, who are from rural areas of bihar and are madhubani painters by profession. while these paintings are full of colours, their own lives and individuality is colourless. the installation also presents a short video which documents thoughts and views of artists involved in the project and the journey that resulted in this installation., madhusree basu, swachhandacharinee is a story-telling based on malayalam poet vayalar ramavarma’s poem thadaka. it reclaims the so-called demoness thadaka from ramayana as a dravida princess and brings in explicit socio-political, feminist, neo-mythological nuances to this story. ours is a re-narration of vayalar’s poem., i was a student of mohiniattam when i first thought of this project more than six years back. i was very intrigued by the beautiful poem and the similarity between its rendition (by madhoosudanan nair) and the usual renditions of songs within the classical mohiniattam repertoires. at that point, it surprised me why we did not think of performing such politically inspiring poems within the classical boundary itself frequently enough. much later, a. k. ramanujan's three hundred ramayanas is one of the important, well-known examples., for this performance, i have worked with another dancer (anoushka kurien), a singer (akila), two mask-makers (pranav sreerag and vijay ravikumar) and a film-director/videographer (manoj leonel jahson). maarten visser has helped me out in creating and mixing the sound. i have had immense help from jayanti basu, ankur and yadu vasudev in conceptualizing and writing the script. i see this project as a collaboration among all the contributors as well as many friends and advisors. for me, that has been the largest strength while making this work., himani pant, the word ‘hysteria’ originates from the greek word ‘hystera’ which means ‘uterus’. in the texts of ancient greek physicians hysteria is described as a female specific ailment that arises when the uterus starts wandering around in the woman’s body putting pressure on the other organs., this leads to anxiety, numbness, faintness, insomnia, heaviness in the abdomen, shortness of breath, loss of appetite for food or sex, sexually forward behaviour, hallucinations, paralysis, following with the most commonly visible symptom - “tendency to cause trouble’!, the first step of my research was to interview women of different age groups, who have in the past or are presently experiencing psychological stress. i am specifically looking for women who had or are seeking medical help for depression, mood swings, and anger management issues or other mental health related issue. my research is to understand their backgrounds, seek their opinion on the topic of hysteria, and gain from their responses an insight in to the connection between their conditions and their gender, if any., this in my opinion helped me gather stories that might have been classified as hysteria in the past., hysterical hysteria is a devised piece that has been based on data collected by interviewing women through questionnaires and telephonic conversations. at gender bender festival a fifteen minute piece will be showcased, which later will be turned into a full length play., aarthi murali, when i came across gender bender's call for applications, i impulsively wanted to write about things we say and do within a home - things that we are in the middle of, everyday. it was a vague starting point. but it was also when i was turning to queer and feminist spaces to help me understand the drama within my home. i felt disconnected because these spaces were only having loud conversations about legal recognition, or the more personal struggle of figuring out one's gender. , i wanted to write something that looks closely at families. and more importantly, to find relief in trying to understand subtleties in structures that seemed loud and clear. , i'd start a new draft, tell myself it's the last one, and scrap it again. in the actual final draft, it only made sense to write about the process itself. this is a lyric essay that's as much about the process of writing about my mother, as it is about my relationship with her. it's an attempt to make sense of a relationship, through the writing of it. , arunima bose, earlier this year, i started drawing different vaginas depending on my mood. after creating about 30 pieces, i felt the series was moving in a new direction, one i was keen to see through. , in full bloom: playing with pleasure is an interactive installation, inviting the audience to touch, experience, and engage the tactile senses with the pleasure of a simple touch. , this work aims to gradually move away from the constant negativity poked and prodded at women and their bodies. , ibtisam, the majority of my childhood and teenage years were spent growing up in the gulf. my mother who learned how to speak arabic fluently taught my sibling and i the same. , i believe that this more than anything else, gave us a unique insight into the culture within the middle east. with this experience as my personal history it formed the foundation and reference of my inspiration for this piece that exlores the lives of the lgbtqia community in middle-eastern society, because it's where having a certain gender made a significant difference in any given situation. the idea continued to grow until it was a collective experience of not just my own but one connected to many women, and other minorities such as the lgbtqia within this region. , finally it is a visual attempt at comparing modern ideas and concepts of culture and the roles of women and presence of the lgbtqia against historical ones. , elisabeth pfahl, my work explores the processing of unexpected loss, in my case a double mastectomy which has reshaped my body at a relatively young age and without genetic ties or warning of any illness. , it is a long journey from breast reconstruction to 'one-on-one-off' to ‘flatness’, from the once familiar to internalising that “a kilo of tissue is just a kilo of tissue” to ""fit, flat feminine and fabulous”! in the throws of decision making,, i hope my ‘mala of 27 bras’ begins a conversation about the emotions that shape and guide one's understanding of self, beauty, loss and healing while the messiness of life dances around us. , sreecheta das, i had heard about china pal from one of my ex-colleagues. i wanted to make the film on her and hence went and met her. the idol making season had just ended (it was just after the saraswati puja) and she was about to go out on a vacation with her mother and workers. so it did not work out but she was constantly there at the back of my mind. hence, the moment i saw the call for proposals from gender bender 2017 i knew whom to make a film on., it's been more than two decades that chaina has started off as the sole woman artisan in kumartuli. it's astonishing how she's still the only female entrepreneur- cum-artisan in that colony. being the youngest sister amongst seven children, she never got her due from her family who do not celebrate her sucess or her journey. but her passion to stick on to the art has rewarded her with a family outside of her family: her workers. she is a ""didi"" (elder sister) to all of them., shilpa kothakota, in an attempt to portray ‘yellamma’ and ‘dasappa’, siddhanth and i embarked on yet another journey. playing these roles meant, to untangle the notions of gender and sexuality starting with our own. the characters and the process changed us irrevocably, making it an important milestone in our lives. performing land of ashes deepened my interest in understanding this form and this powerful deity of various marginal societies - dalits, jogthis, devdasis and transgender people. we are showcasing 15 minutes of the entire 2-hour play. it is more like a teaser that covers a crucial part of the story that leads to renuka becoming yellamma.",0.10030338513945072,"gender , re-imagined","gender bender 2017 , joint project sandbox collective goethe-institut/max mueller bhavan , co-curated ladies finger , held september 9 10 goethe-insitut. grantees speak works. , sukriti sureka , muzaffarpur bihar currently living mumbai. self-taught artist/painter. presenting art installation , “berang se rang ” art installation madhubani paintings small hut. ’ simple small hut , similar many seen india. outside process decorated madhubani painting. inside , showcases series madhubani paintings depict several forms women face bias discrimination basis gender. paintings done various artists , including , rural areas bihar madhubani painters profession. paintings full colours , lives individuality colourless. installation also presents short video documents thoughts views artists involved project journey resulted installation. , madhusree basu , swachhandacharinee story-telling based malayalam poet vayalar ramavarma ’ poem thadaka. reclaims so-called demoness thadaka ramayana dravida princess brings explicit socio-political , feminist , neo-mythological nuances story. re-narration vayalar ’ poem. , student mohiniattam first thought project six years back. intrigued beautiful poem similarity rendition ( madhoosudanan nair ) usual renditions songs within classical mohiniattam repertoires. point , surprised think performing politically inspiring poems within classical boundary frequently enough. much later , a. k. ramanujan ' three hundred ramayanas one important , well-known examples. , performance , worked another dancer ( anoushka kurien ) , singer ( akila ) , two mask-makers ( pranav sreerag vijay ravikumar ) film-director/videographer ( manoj leonel jahson ) . maarten visser helped creating mixing sound. immense help jayanti basu , ankur yadu vasudev conceptualizing writing script. see project collaboration among contributors well many friends advisors. , largest strength making work. , himani pant , word ‘hysteria ’ originates greek word ‘hystera ’ means ‘uterus ’ . texts ancient greek physicians hysteria described female specific ailment arises uterus starts wandering around woman ’ body putting pressure organs. , leads anxiety , numbness , faintness , insomnia , heaviness abdomen , shortness breath , loss appetite food sex , sexually forward behaviour , hallucinations , paralysis , following commonly visible symptom -

dalits, jogthis, devdasis and transgender people. we are showcasing 15 minutes of the entire 2-hour play. it is more like a teaser that covers a crucial part of the story that leads to renuka becoming yellamma.",0.10030338513945072,"gender , re-imagined","gender bender 2017 , joint project sandbox collective goethe-institut/max mueller bhavan , co-curated ladies finger , held september 9 10 goethe-insitut. grantees speak works. , sukriti sureka , muzaffarpur bihar currently living mumbai. self-taught artist/painter. presenting art installation , “berang se rang ” art installation madhubani paintings small hut. ’ simple small hut , similar many seen india. outside process decorated madhubani painting. inside , showcases series madhubani paintings depict several forms women face bias discrimination basis gender. paintings done various artists , including , rural areas bihar madhubani painters profession. paintings full colours , lives individuality colourless. installation also presents short video documents thoughts views artists involved project journey resulted installation. , madhusree basu , swachhandacharinee story-telling based malayalam poet vayalar ramavarma ’ poem thadaka. reclaims so-called demoness thadaka ramayana dravida princess brings explicit socio-political , feminist , neo-mythological nuances story. re-narration vayalar ’ poem. , student mohiniattam first thought project six years back. intrigued beautiful poem similarity rendition ( madhoosudanan nair ) usual renditions songs within classical mohiniattam repertoires. point , surprised think performing politically inspiring poems within classical boundary frequently enough. much later , a. k. ramanujan ' three hundred ramayanas one important , well-known examples. , performance , worked another dancer ( anoushka kurien ) , singer ( akila ) , two mask-makers ( pranav sreerag vijay ravikumar ) film-director/videographer ( manoj leonel jahson ) . maarten visser helped creating mixing sound. immense help jayanti basu , ankur yadu vasudev conceptualizing writing script. see project collaboration among contributors well many friends advisors. , largest strength making work. , himani pant , word ‘hysteria ’ originates greek word ‘hystera ’ means ‘uterus ’ . texts ancient greek physicians hysteria described female specific ailment arises uterus starts wandering around woman ’ body putting pressure organs. , leads anxiety , numbness , faintness , insomnia , heaviness abdomen , shortness breath , loss appetite food sex , sexually forward behaviour , hallucinations , paralysis , following commonly visible symptom -

because the numerical average of the class scores was 96 points. the professor had purposely raised the perfect score to 137 points. this exam was tougher; the average score had dropped. rationally, the students should have been unhappy. instead, they were elated., that professor is behavioural economist richard thaler, the winner of the nobel prize in economics this year. he went on to show that even small departures from rationality have outsized impacts, and that limitedly rational humans don’t fit neatly into classical economics. so, he helped develop a new branch of economics, behavioural economics, to study the interplay of human quirks and economic forces., prof. thaler’s work is famously applied in constructing choices. how a choice is framed tends to influence choosers’ behaviour. choice architects can thus ‘nudge’ choosers in a direction. for instance, by making a pension plan the default option, while giving the choice to opt out, people can be ‘nudged’ towards saving for their retirement. scores of people have been successfully enrolled into pension schemes by default this way., pushing people in the directions that the choice architects prefer is not nudging, though. the nudge philosophy is that the chosen option makes choosers better off as judged by themselves. say the problem at hand is unhealthy eating habits, which lead to obesity. an extreme solution would be strictly-enforced bans and diktats on food that can be consumed and that which is prohibited. a less extreme public policy would be a sin tax on fat or sugar. nudge-type policies, on the other hand, would tend to include things like displaying the healthier food options relatively more prominently. or mandating calorie labels on sweets boxes., development policies become measurably more effective when combined with insights into human behaviour. a common refrain in india is that constructing toilets will not guarantee cleanliness and hygiene; swachh bharat will succeed truly if behaviours change. for which mindsets must change. in experiments conducted in some states, application of behavioural economics successfully changed the sanitation mindset. the world bank has documented some of the pilots. one such study found that open defecation dropped 11% from very high levels after a community-led total sanitation programme was combined in a few chosen villages with the standard approach of subsidies for toilet construction and information on the transmission of diseases., since going out in the open is partly a social norm, the researchers tried to facilitate the building of a new social norm. a technique was used in which volunteers escorted the villagers out to the field where they put some food next to some human waste. the experiment involved watching the flies go back and forth. the villages were nudged into collectively rejecting open defecation by making a declaration in public. the point being that to reap the benefits of sanitation, everybody has to do it together. behaviours changed measurably., another study involved puzzle-solving sessions. it helped understanding the effects of caste on classroom performance. boys from backward classes were found to be just as good at solving puzzles as boys from the upper castes when the caste identities were not revealed. in mixed-caste groups, revealing each of the boys’ caste created a significant “caste gap” in achievements. the boys from backward classes underperformed by 23%.",0.10811794131794134,architecture choice,"humans unerring. often enough , perfectly rational people tend behave irrationally , salesman advertiser would attest. simply reducing price ₹ 1,000 ₹ 999.99 increases sales. economists used believe human irrationality compatible economic theory. psychologists showed 1960s humans irrational systemic way. , consider true story. class found exam average score 72 points 100 ‘too tough ’ . set students delighted scoring average 70 % subsequent one. ?

2017-10-20,restrictions on women at sabarimala: it is complicated,"(a shorter version of this article appeared as part of a left-right-centre debate that can be read here), taking the sabarimala temple to court for restricting the entry of women of a certain age group is akin to meat-eaters suing vegetarian restaurants for discriminating against non-vegetarians by refusing to serve meat. common sense response would be to say—‘go find a non-veg restaurant, of which there are plenty’. tomorrow, self-styled, ill-informed reformers might demand that durga-kali worship be stopped because it legitimizes violence or declare the worship of shiv lingam as “obscene.” this is not farfetched because politically motivated groups have been decrying durga as a whore and krishna as womanizer. therefore, they declare these deities are not worthy of reverence., in any civilized society, gender equality is to be treated as one of the core values. however, with apologies to faiz ahmed faiz, aur bhi gham hein zamane mein gender equality ke siwa”. there are many more important values a democracy must uphold while standing up for gender equality—certainly not make a fetish of women’s rights., other core values of our democracy & india civilization are respect for diversity among the enormous range of communities co-habiting in india with substantial differences (as well as commonalities) in matters of faith, cultural practices, value systems, family structure, dress codes, food habits & ways of relating to the world as well as the divine. while the leftist-feminist reformers have no difficulty in respecting the rights of ‘religious minorities”—namely muslims and christians—to live by their own cherished cultural and faith traditions, when it comes to diverse hindu groups, they consider it their divine right to dictate terms., the unique grandeur of the hindu faith lies in the fact that each group, each sect and each individual is free to envisage the divine in whatever form, shape, and temperament that devotees like. that's how we have millions of devis and devatas with new ones taking avatar as and when the situation so demands or their devotees so desire. practically every village in india has its own gram devi or devata. our devis and devatas are not distant, unfathomable entities forever sitting in some distant god-land or heaven. they take avatar on earth to offer succour & comfort to those in need. in the process each one acquires distinct personality traits as well as preferences with regard to mode of worship., take the contrasting tastes of ma kali and vaishnodevi, both of whom are manifestations of the same shakti. while vaishnodevi demands strict vegetarianism, animals are routinely sacrificed as offerings to ma kali. lord ganesh likes modak as prasad while hanuman ji prefers boondi and lord shiva devotees offer milk and even bhang. devotees of various deities do not begrudge the practices of others. this freedom has kept alive vibrant diversity in our faith traditions because they allow individuals and groups to define their relationship to the divine according to their preferences., it is the same freedom which allowed manushi to invoke ten armed ma swachhnarayani, as our isht devi.she wields ten different non-traditional weapons that include a broom as symbol of cleansing society of corruption, weighing balance to symbolise social justice, a calculator that demands honest accounts of government, and a video camera that points to the need for an accurate grasp of ground realtity for those engaged in social reform. no hindu has ever questioned or protested against the powers we attribute to our isht devi or our mode of worship that includes jhadu puja., the hindu faith has thus remained amongst the most liberal in the world, with different groups and individuals exercising the right to relate to the divine in whatever way they wish, without insisting that others must follow their chosen path., even the most conservative among hindus don’t insist on uniformity of beliefs and practices. this spontaneous, mutual respect for differences in ways of being, ways of worship, singing, dancing, clothing, cooking and so on, is what enabled the rich diversity of india to survive through millennia. but in the name of equality rabid feminists can’t stomach such freedom and liberalism., traditional hindu temples are run by different sects with each choosing a particular deity in a particular form as their isht dev or devi. they’re not meant as tourist spots for all to come & go as they please. if you don’t respect the unique temperament of that deity or find beliefs of a particular sect offensive, you are free to opt for the devata or devi that suits your taste. there are lakhs of others to choose from., just as our colonial rulers with their faith in the superiority of their monotheistic faith, despised hindu religious practices, with their millions of gods and goddesses, our modern day missionaries can’t stand the temperamental nuances of our diverse deities. they have no problem in accepting that women are barred inside friaries meant to house catholic priests who have taken a vow of celibacy. but they can’t stomach the idea of a hindu deity who has vowed eternal celibacy which involves avoiding the company of young women. they take it upon themselves to cure this kink because their feminist indoctrination interprets it as misogny and gender discrimination! they choose to ignore that it is only one or two temples in all of india where women of certain age groups are denied entry whereas there are several ‘women-only’ temples where males are denied entry., as far as the issue of gender justice is concerned, the hindu faith can hardly be considered anti-women, considering it is the only faith that worships the feminine as shakti--the mighty force that moves the universe. male deities are powerless without feminine shakti from whom various devatas derive their strength., when i find the case against sabarimala frivolous, it is not to suggest that hindu faith traditions are writ in stone and unchanging. devotees reserve the right to change their dharmic practices as well as demand improved behavior by their chosen deities as per the requirements of changing times. that is how we have countless re-writings of ramayanas in different ages with each one interpreting ram in their own way and many even improving upon valmiki's depiction of ram’s conduct in various ways, especially his abandoning ma sita even after she had gone through an uncalled for agni pariksha or the deceit involved in the killing of baliraja. but it doesn’t behove non-believers or hostile attackers of hindu faith to impose their fads and sensibilities on groups who don’t share their worldview, especially if their practices don’t impact, leave alone harm the non-devotees. a genuine devotee has the right to demand change but not politically motivated hateful critics., ironically, the flag bearers of women’s equality don’t seem to have any problem with special compartments reserved for women in trains. most of them insist on our parliament enacting a law to reserve 33% constituencies for women whereby males are barred from contesting from those seats. they’re not satisfied with laws that promise equality. they insist on legislation that is unjustly loaded in favor of women. you can’t have it both ways – fetishize equality when it suits you and insist on special concessions and previliges as per your dictates.",0.1589676146638172,restrictions women sabarimala : complicated,"( shorter version article appeared part left-right-centre debate read ) , taking sabarimala temple court restricting entry

2017-11-22,"by june 2018, you will be able to see smart cities, says hardeep singh puri","hardeep singh puri. , two and a half months ago, in a surprise appointment, a former indian foreign service officer was made minister of state (independent charge) of housing and urban affairs. hardeep singh puri, who served as india’s permanent representative to the united nations from 2009 to 2013, has a multitude of projects to deliver on, including the prime minister’s ambitious smart cities mission, housing for all, and swachh bharat mission. excerpts from an interview on the challenges ahead:, in an ideal world, where resources are unlimited, you could perhaps devise a scheme to ‘smartify’ the entire area. clearly it’s not an ideal world. you have limited resources and you have to make a beginning somewhere. the present project, as i understand it, is the start of a process. it is not exclusive and it most certainly doesn’t mean neglecting other areas. there are other schemes like amrut (atal mission for rejuvenation and urban transformation) which look at providing basic infrastructure. i don’t think there were any claims by the smart cities mission to cover the entire city. i suggest you allow these schemes to unfold., in an ideal scenario, you should have the state and private sector in a happy blend. for much of the infrastructure like urban transport, especially metro projects which are capital-intensive, you need the state to step in. personally, i have no doubt that unless you do the pricing right, world-class facilities will not be available. safe transport, for example, cannot be subsidised by the state. it is just not sustainable. for example, i was travelling from gwalior to delhi and a four hour-long journey took eight hours for a variety of reasons. the price of the ticket was ₹900, obviously heavily subsidised. for comparison, in china which has a more efficient system, a ticket would cost ₹4,000., this is a purely rhetorical question. if the private sector is building toilets, the private sector will maintain them. recently, during an inspection of toilets, i found someone urinating in close proximity to a public urinal. i remarked to my secretary that i am sure this man is not doing so out of choice, but out of compulsion. the toilet must not be well maintained. as a result of that one inspection, we have drawn up a list of all public toilets in the ncr (national capital region). we have names of the authorities or agencies that build them, the name of the agencies responsible for their maintenance and the names of individual supervisors. the toilets were not getting maintained because no one was taking interest., let me tell you this: this government is not going anywhere; we are going to be around for a long time. i am sure what we need to do is devise systems and fix accountability. i have been told that by merely drawing up a list of public toilets, there has been vast improvement. it was the first step towards fixing accountability. we are also planning to come up with a toilet template that will have specifications for odour levels, water availability, exhaust fans, and so on., their (rural mission) task is much larger. for the period of 2014 to 2019, the gap in the number of toilets was found to be 68 lakh, out of which 40 lakh have been built and 14 lakh are under construction. budgetary allocations reflect the amount of work we need to do. tomorrow, if we have more people coming to urban areas, of course we will need to do more. for now, the budget is sufficient., we need to enhance our capacity. and capacity augmentation should not come from the government alone. others must be encouraged to enter too, in order to produce viable economic propositions. if your question is, ‘i see so much dirt around’, then my advice would be to click a picture and upload it on the swachh bharat app. i am told there is 75% compliance. we are dealing with an issue which previous governments have been brushing under the carpet. the opposition criticised prime minister narendra modi for speaking about swachh bharat from the ramparts of the red fort. i think he was right to do so. when a prime minister takes up an issue, it becomes a national andolan. today, on lines of satyagrahis we have swachhgrahis., rhetoric would mean there is more talk and no work. which isn’t true; there is work being done on the ground. and at least there is talk. at least we are shaming people., we have done more than we can. we have banned it, we are taking effective steps to discourage it, we are buying advanced machines. criticism like this is not constructive., the solution is not to swing into action just when you have that problem but to find a lasting solution. one is to de-congest cities. we made a plan in 2016. my ministry cannot take all the measures; there is a lot that the delhi government needs to do. i have spoken to chief minister arvind kejriwal and i have a couple of demands. first, metro phase-iv that has been pending for three years... he should bring in the proposal and we will clear it right away. then there are the delhi-meerut, delhi-ghaziabad corridors which need to be cleared. in so far as buses are concerned, we are seized of the matter. of 11,000 sanctioned buses, less than half are plying in the city. i can’t buy buses for them. they have collected cess worth ₹800 crore to purchase buses, which is lying with them. we are also working with dmrc (delhi metro rail corporation) to take urgent steps for last-mile connectivity., i am not going to comment on the delhi chief minister’s schemes. i have enough on my plate. i am very confident that the measures we have to take at the level of the ministry of urban affairs... we will be able to take them. in any case, pressure seems to have eased a bit with improvement in air quality. however, my way of looking at it is a little different. now that the air is slightly cleaner, we must take corrective action., for 70 years, we didn’t have a regulator. the history of indian real estate will be studied in two parts: pre- and post-real estate (regulation & development) act, 2016 (rera). real estate was the epicentre of black money. if you had black money and you did not feel like keeping it at home in gunny bags or under your mattress, you gave it to a builder, who would book a flat for you in his next project. rera, demonestisation and gst are instruments to clean this up. how many quarters will it take to clean up? i frankly don’t know. but two things will definitely happen — the speculative bubble that was going on due to black money shall be broken. and land prices will get more realistically aligned.",0.11200697450697453,"june 2018 , able see smart cities , says hardeep singh puri","hardeep singh puri. , two half months ago , surprise appointment , former indian foreign service officer made minister state ( independent charge ) housing urban affairs. hardeep singh puri , served india ’ permanent representative united nations 2009 2013 , multitude projects deliver , including prime minister ’ ambitious smart cities mission , housing , swachh bharat mission. excerpts interview challenges ahead : , ideal world , resources unlimited , could perhaps devise scheme ‘smartify ’ entire area. clearly ’ ideal world. limited resources make beginning somewhere. present project , understand , start process. exclusive certainly ’ mean neglecting areas. schemes like amrut ( atal mission rejuvenation urban transformation ) look providing basic infrastructure. ’ think claims smart cities mission cover entire city. suggest allow schemes unfold. , ideal scenario , state private sector happy blend. much infrastructure like urban transport , especially metro projects capital-intensive , need state step in. personally , doubt unless pricing right , world-class facilities available. safe transport , example , cannot subsidised state. sustainable. example , travelling gwalior delhi four hour-long journey took eight hours variety reasons. price ticket ₹ 900 , obviously heavily subsidised. comparison , china efficient system , ticket would cost ₹ 4,000. , purely rhetorical question. private sector building toilets , private sector maintain them. recently , inspection toilets , found someone urinating close proximity public urinal. remarked secretary sure man choice , compulsion. toilet must well maintained. result one inspection , drawn list public toilets ncr ( national capital region ) . names authorities agencies build , name agencies responsible maintenance names individual supervisors. toilets getting maintained one taking interest. , let tell : government going anywhere ;

2017-11-25, puppetry in odisha: who is pulling the strings?,"a ravana chhaya performance. | photo credit: indraneel lahiri , a white screen, about 4x6 feet, is tied to two metal poles at a height of three feet from the ground. a group of puppeteers and musicians sits behind it, hidden by a curtain that is hung from the screen. the performers hold up flat leather puppets against a light bulb and the shadow play begins., it looks like sunrise as the puppets gradually appear on the ‘horizon’, being raised from below the stage by the puppeteers on the other side. there is a clash of cymbals; the harmonium matches the beats of the mridangam; the daskathi, two wooden sticks held in the palm, does a constant clackety-clack. the singing is sometimes euphoric, sometimes pleading, sometimes heroic, as befits the characters., hanuman comes to the rescue of sita in lanka and is confronted by the demon-like lanka devi. in this black-and-white battle of good and evil, the latter must inevitably be defeated: there is raucous, victorious laughter as the demons fall in a trembling heap., i feel like i have been watching scenes from my unconscious. i remember gouranga charan dash, the retired head of the odia department in cuttack’s ravenshaw college and an authority on shadow puppetry, telling me that in the west, shadow puppetry is used to treat patients suffering from mental illnesses., i am at the museum of puppetry, called kandhei ghara (kandhei means puppet in odia), being set up by dash in serene, paddy-field-chequered kutarimunda village in odisha’s angul district. the museum has not been inaugurated yet: dash has arranged a private show to acquaint me with shadow puppetry, called ravana chhaya in odisha (ram, being divinity, theoretically cannot cast shadows; hence the name unwittingly making ravana the hero of these plays, which originally used stories only from the ramayana)., four for joy, odisha is perhaps the country’s only state where four forms of puppetry thrive — shadow puppetry; rod puppetry, where wooden puppets are hoisted up on stage with a metal rod attached to their body and covered by their flowing garments; glove puppetry or sakhi kandhei nata, where the puppets are formed by a ‘glove’, with the index finger becoming the head and the middle finger and thumb the arms of the puppet; and lastly, string puppetry, where the puppets are made to dance with the help of strings attached to their limbs., abhay singh and his glove puppets. | photo credit: indraneel lahiri , once it is ready, dash’s kandhei ghara will display puppets from across the country, host performances, seminars and workshops for national and international researchers, and also have a library. surrounded by puppets that stare at you in an uncannily human way, dash, who did his ph.d on puppetry and is also a ravana chhaya performer, tells me a play won’t come to life unless you are in a relationship with the puppets, who are the ones doing the manipulation, rather than the puppet-meister. the word ‘love’ keeps coming up., dash’s passion is apparent. he confides that in the early years of his engagement, he had been warned by his peers about the insidious charm of the dolls. “the puppets are demanding — they will make you forget every other love, make you indifferent to your wife,’ they had told me,” he says. if anything, that made dash’s commitment even stronger, and no, he didn’t forget his wife., sabitri dash, retired teacher of odia language and literature, is actively engaged with her husband in the promotion and performance of puppetry. together, they run the srirama institute of shadow theatre in kutarimunda, which aims to preserve, modernise and facilitate research on puppetry., india shares this ancient culture with other old civilisations like the greek and the chinese., puppet shows, especially ravana chhaya with its shadow play, are the earliest movies and it is ironic that the coming of television has irreversibly eroded the performers’ audience base., puppets for propaganda, puppeteers are dwindling in number but they still have the power to hold people in thrall, not just in the villages but also in the cities. this must be one of the reasons why the government has been using the art form to popularise its flagship programmes such as swachh bharat abhiyan, and to spread awareness on hiv-aids, human trafficking, malaria and deforestation., such modules are plugged as part of efforts to ‘revive’ puppetry, but the intervention, which has helped the artists in several ways, has not always had a salutary effect. governments often prefer to fix scripts according to political agendas and their conception of the ‘purity’ of the art form. this has tended to sanitise performances., rod puppeteer maguni charan kuanr. | photo credit: indraneel lahiri , as a poor man’s mode of expression and entertainment (the performers were often from marginalised communities), puppetry usually contained elements like short satirical skits against the moneyed class that would be inserted between narratives from the ramayana, mahabharata or the puranas. performed in open village spaces and reaching out to the audience, who would be sitting on the ground a few feet away from the performers, puppetry was always meant to be interactive rather than preachy., it also demands constant improvisation and funny, out-of-the-box bits to hold the audience’s attention., when the government stipulates script, musical instruments and performance parameters, there isn’t much room for innovation., most of the artists have chosen to toe the government’s line, not just for the money it brings (which isn’t really sufficient) but also because it gives them recognition. in my conversations with the puppeteers, delhi invariably featured as the place to be in., while the idea of performing in a closed space to an audience of aficionados in the capital is understandably attractive, it also means the art is moving further away from its origins. performances in villages, which had once given puppetry its settings and context, are now considered demeaning by the artists., dash has been trying hard to revive the village performances — his troupe still travels to the remotest regions — but most puppeteers are reluctant. dash says, “i know how their mind works. they believe that wandering from village to village would immediately brand them as impoverished artists and label their art as ‘low-brow’.”, when the performers fail to get government support or make good money independently, they sell or disband their troupes. dash lashes out at them, saying they are concerned with everything except their art., dash’s idealism and dissidence (he flares up about puppetry being employed for swachh bharat — “that is not art, it’s propaganda,” he fumes) — are admirable. at the same time, you cannot but sympathise with the puppeteers, who are unlikely to have either dash’s intellectual wherewithal or financial cushioning to keep the art alive., kumbhakarna in kendujhar, maguni charan kuanr, a rod puppeteer in his 80s, who has been performing from the age of 27, is an artist par excellence. puppets come alive in his hands in a way that has to be seen to be believed. he is also a sculptor, carpenter and designer: he styles his puppets out of wood and clothes them in multi-coloured costumes. even when they lie lifeless in kuanr’s battered trunk, they look striking; once animated by the master touch, they are irresistible., a string puppet show. | photo credit: indraneel lahiri , kuanr makes kumbhakarna, ravana’s brother from the ramayana, who is dressed in a black satin robe with a silver waistband and sports a stylish handle-bar moustache, ‘speak’ a few lines for me. upset at being roused out of season from his six-month-long hibernation, kumbhakarna complains in a loud, angry voice. kuanr is an expert at voice modulation: he can impersonate gruff kumbhakarna or plaintive sita with equal ease., when i meet kuanr at a half-finished kali puja pandal in kendujhar town, he is sitting on the ground with his legs outstretched — he broke his hips a few months ago. the next day is kali puja and he is busy mixing the colours to be applied on a 12-feet-high idol of kali he has made. the frail man says with confidence that the goddess will be complete by night’s end., when i ask about his puppets, he says, echoing dash, “they are the ones who direct me. if i don’t let them do that, they humiliate me. they are my love and they have put me in great trouble.” then, with sudden canniness, he adds, “they can no longer provide me with bread and butter. no work gets done without money these days. mon theke ki hobe, pashe dhan thaka chai (what’s the point of just having a heart, you must have money near you).”, kuanr has brought in a great number of changes to the art he learnt from his guru. he standardised the dimensions of the puppeteer’s box and used a hand-painted background for the first time. he started using larger puppets (about two feet high) to ensure visibility for a larger audience., monetary constraints have not been able to defeat the artist in kuanr. he is still eager for more innovations, thinking of making puppets of papier-mâché, which, being lighter, will be easier to carry. although his health has taken a beating in the past few months, he is looking forward to travelling with his puppets again — “i get calls from assam, manipur, darjeeling, sikkim. no artist can match my skill: when i play, everybody watches spellbound,” he announces with artistic hauteur., record dance, vidyadhar ratha, of karara mada village in dhenkanal, is a string puppeteer. he presents a portrait of an artist very different from kuanr. at the very beginning of our meeting, he tells me that government-sponsored programmes are convenient because they save him the trouble of having to book spaces, which would involve giving money to the panchayat, the police and local groups., his troupe, made up of family members and artists from neighbouring villages, sells tickets ranging from ₹15 to ₹50, depending on demand and the venue. business is usually good during the festive season., ratha emphasises that he is a poor artist, although, with his pink khadi shirt and dyed hair and affluent-looking household, he seems better off than most other villagers. he tells me, “make a strong case for the likes of us in your paper so that the government gives us an artist’s allowance.” his brothers, part of the troupe, nod in unison., string puppetry seems quite popular — as soon as the first note sounds from ratha’s harmonium, villagers start trooping into his house, even on the dark, rain-lashed day when i was there. i am a bit overwhelmed by the performance that follows., a ravana chhaya performance based on the swachh bharat abhiyan. | photo credit: indraneel lahiri , in a makeshift stage erected at the back of the house, garishly decorated puppets gyrate to odia and hindi songs played on a stereo. at one point in the performance, when a female puppet is dancing wildly to the bollywood hit, ‘nagin, nagin’, five rubber snakes are lowered on the stage to gambol beside her. i am told solemnly that this is called the “record dance”, performed during the intermission or whenever the artists need to take a break, usually to unravel the puppet strings that get tangled during the course of a show., hand in glove, i had heard interesting legends about the glove puppeteers even before i went to meet them in odisha. if eccentricity is one of the defining qualities of artists, then these puppeteers are artists through and through., most glove puppeteers belong to the nomadic kela community, which has settled down in odisha in the past few years. the kelas were once snake-charmers, magicians, quacks and trapeze artists, and have now morphed into pedlars., living up to their nomadic genes, they play hard to get: they have largely refused to be part of government programmes, saying that they won’t be instructed about their own art. but they also want to give it up, as they complain that it marks them as out as belonging to a marginalised, somewhat reviled, group., at kutarimunda, dash called them repeatedly, asking them to come over and give a performance. they agreed initially, but ultimately gave us the slip and i had to be content with a recorded performance., glove puppetry is called sakhi kandhei nata because here the chief characters are krishna and radha and their sakhis. radha is also krishna’s best friend, his alter ego, his soulmate. the philosophy is embodied in the performance, as the krishna and radha puppets are the two arms of the puppeteer. they are literally one body., i watch abhay singh performing in front of a village hut in cinematographer indraneel lahiri’s video documentation of odisha’s puppetry traditions. singh sits on the ground, a dhol strapped to his shoulders. one arm is krishna, with the characteristic blue face, and the other is radha, with a yellow face, both with colourful headgears of tinsel and ribbon.",0.10820298721340388,puppetry

2018-02-02, promise and delivery: on union budget 2018,"if the union budget is construed as an annual tug-of-war between populism and fiscal prudence, arguably it is the latter that prevailed in the past four budgets tabled by the nda. however, populism seems to have gained an upper hand in arun jaitley’s latest effort. despite exceptional buoyancy in direct tax revenues (18.7% growth in fy18) and record disinvestment proceeds (₹1 lakh crore), shortfalls in gst mop-ups and dividend receipts have forced the finance minister to ease off on fiscal consolidation as mandated by the frbm act. the budget has reported a fiscal deficit of 3.5% (of gdp) for fy18 and pegged it at a high 3.3% for next year. the economic survey prepared the ground for a deviation, yet the actual numbers surprised the markets. armed with a war chest of ₹24.4 lakh crore in budgeted receipts for fy19, mr. jaitley has homed in unerringly on the root causes of distress — unremunerative farm incomes, unemployment, lack of social security nets and the squeeze on the middle-class taxpayer., follow the hindu's comprehensive coverage of budget 2018., with this in mind, mr. jaitley has announced a laundry list of ameliorative measures. while his intent is clearly welfarist, resource constraints have forced him to rely significantly on extra-budgetary resources and external agencies to give life to many proposals. if they fail to materialise, it can lead to a gap between promise and delivery. consider agriculture. after asserting that minimum support prices (msps) should cover all crops and assure farmers 1.5 times their production cost, food subsidy allocations for fy19 have been upped by a relatively modest ₹29,041 crore. a ‘fool-proof’ mechanism has been mooted to avoid market prices falling below msps, but it is left to the niti aayog to work out the modalities. setting up farmers’ markets is similarly a great idea to free small farmers from the tyranny of agricultural produce market committees (apmcs), but the project gets a mere ₹2,000-crore allocation., also readplaying on the front foot, playing on the front foot, the ambitious rural package in this budget brings in free gas connections to three crore new households, free electricity connections to four crore homes, two crore new toilets under the swachh bharat mission, higher micro-irrigation coverage, and so on. but of the massive outlay of ₹14.34 lakh crore required to bankroll these grandiose plans, as much as ₹11.98 lakh crore is expected to be met from extra-budgetary resources. a similar template has been used in social sector schemes. the national health protection scheme, to provide a ₹5 lakh health cover to 10 crore households, is a much-needed social security intervention to benefit poor households that rely overwhelmingly on private health care. but there is little clarity on modalities. the entire clutch of proposals on improving learning outcomes, providing universal health coverage and alleviating the lot of minorities and girl children is expected to be funded through a mere ₹16,000-crore increase in allocations to ₹1.38 lakh crore. infrastructure appears to be one of the few sectors where the funding problem has been addressed, with psus bankrolling a significant proportion of the ₹5.97-lakh crore outlay for fy19., also readgood but could have been better , good but could have been better, while being liberal in its announcements for rural india, the budget has been frugal in its giveaways to the middle class and the corporate sector. expectations of an increase in the basic exemption limit on income tax have been belied; instead, a standard deduction of ₹40,000 is back for salaried taxpayers. while it is only fair that the salaried pay income tax on their net income (after expenses) as the self-employed do, this deduction (which also replaces transport and medical reimbursements) is too small to establish real parity. the clamour for an across-the-board cut in the basic corporate tax rate from 30 to 25% has also been ignored, with the cut limited to mid-size companies (up to ₹250-crore turnover). though this will benefit the overwhelming majority of corporate tax filers, how this impacts the competitive edge of india’s largest companies in the global context will be debated. especially so, since the u.s. recently slashed its corporate tax rate to 21% and european nations average 20%. for the salariat and the corporate sector, the increase in education cess will offset some of the gains from these tax cuts. senior citizens have benefited, particularly from the tax relief on interest from bank deposits and post office schemes, which has been hiked from ₹10,000 to ₹50,000 a year. these interest payouts are also exempt from the vexatious tds provisions. this relief renders senior citizens far less vulnerable to steadily dwindling interest rates on bank deposits and small savings schemes; it also helps them to continue relying on fixed-income instruments to cover living expenses. this relief may reverse the unhealthy trend of risk-averse savers shifting wholesale from bank deposits to market-linked options such as equity mutual funds, in search of higher returns., also reada shot in the arm for farm growth ",0.040780605053860865,promise delivery : union budget 2018,"union budget construed annual tug-of-war populism fiscal prudence , arguably latter prevailed past four budgets tabled nda. however , populism seems gained upper hand arun jaitley ’ latest effort. despite exceptional buoyancy direct tax revenues ( 18.7 % growth fy18 ) record disinvestment proceeds ( ₹ 1 lakh crore ) , shortfalls gst mop-ups dividend receipts forced finance minister ease fiscal consolidation mandated frbm act. budget reported fiscal deficit 3.5 % ( gdp ) fy18 pegged high 3.3 % next year. economic survey prepared ground deviation , yet actual numbers surprised markets. armed war chest ₹ 24.4 lakh crore budgeted receipts fy19 , mr. jaitley homed unerringly root causes distress — unremunerative farm incomes , unemployment , lack social security nets squeeze middle-class taxpayer. , follow hindu ' comprehensive coverage budget 2018. , mind , mr. jaitley announced laundry list ameliorative measures. intent clearly welfarist , resource constraints forced rely significantly extra-budgetary resources external agencies give life many proposals. fail materialise , lead gap promise delivery. consider agriculture. asserting minimum support prices ( msps ) cover crops assure farmers 1.5 times production cost , food subsidy allocations fy19 upped relatively modest ₹ 29,041 crore. ‘fool-proof ’ mechanism mooted avoid market prices falling msps , left niti aayog work modalities. setting farmers ’ markets similarly great idea free small farmers tyranny agricultural produce market committees ( apmcs ) , project gets mere ₹ 2,000-crore allocation. , also readplaying front foot , playing front foot , ambitious rural package budget brings free gas connections three crore new households , free electricity connections four crore homes , two crore new toilets swachh bharat mission , higher micro-irrigation coverage , on. massive outlay ₹ 14.34 lakh crore required bankroll grandiose plans , much ₹ 11.98 lakh crore expected met extra-budgetary resources. similar template used social sector schemes. national health protection scheme , provide ₹ 5 lakh health cover 10 crore households , much-needed social security intervention benefit poor households rely overwhelmingly private health care. little clarity modalities. entire clutch proposals improving learning outcomes , providing universal health coverage alleviating lot minorities girl children expected funded mere ₹ 16,000-crore increase allocations ₹ 1.38 lakh crore. infrastructure appears one sectors funding problem addressed , psus bankrolling significant proportion ₹ 5.97-lakh crore outlay fy19. , also readgood could better , good could better , liberal announcements rural india , budget frugal giveaways middle class corporate sector. expectations increase basic exemption limit income tax belied ;

2018-02-04," for mumbai’s poor women, there is no place to go ","mumbai: in the early hours of december 26 last year, sitabai solanke, 51, couldn’t find a toilet at kalyan station, and so relieved herself in the bushes near the tracks. on her way back to the platform, a train ran over her and she died., claira dias, 20, has an equally tragic story to share. till a few years ago, children from azad nagar, the slum in mahim where she lives, would defecate on the railway tracks near their homes because there was no toilet. one day, she says, a man who lived nearby lured a four-year-old with sweets and raped her there and went on to mutilate her private parts. ms. dias says the girl was not even given counselling, and nothing has been heard of the accused since. “jaisa ek bura sapna tha, hum uthke bhul gaye it was like a bad dream: we woke and forgot it. our children defecate into the nullah that runs in front of our homes, because we do not let them out alone anymore.”, the lack of toilet facilities for women plays out in many ways, all not as horrific, but definitely stressful., for a decade, saraswati narayankar has been setting up her stall of vegetables on st. anthony’s road, vakola, at a 15-minute walk away from home. she wakes up at 4 a.m., queues up for an average of 15 minutes at the pay toilet near her home, and then heads to dadar to buy her stock. then, from 8 a.m. to 2 p.m., and from 5 p.m. to 9 p.m., she is at her stall. there is a public toilet a minute’s walk away, but she uses it only if she absolutely must. “there is nobody to maintain it, and so it is always dirty,” she says. “there is no way i can risk falling ill by going there.” on the days of her menstruation, she suffers the most. with no water supply in the public toilet, she controls her bladder for six hours and limits her consumption of water. “i go home, change my sanitary napkin, rest and then return to work. there is no way i can use the toilet without water on those days.”, not far from ms. narayankar's vegetable stall in vakola, kalpana jagde worries about leaving her provision store unattended, if she has to relieve herself. “earlier, there were 10 shops here: a tailor, a scrap collector, vegetable vendor, electrical repair store, and many others. all of these shops were run by women, and we had a pact among ourselves to keep one eye on each other’s wares when one of us has to attend to nature’s call.” the other vendors did not have licences and were evicted, and while she has one, hers is the only shop standing. “but it means that i cannot afford to forget going to the bathroom before i leave home.”, street hawkers, construction workers, house help who aren’t allowed to use the toilets in the homes they work in, even police personnel on outdoor duty, there are lakhs of such women across the city, effectively invisible, silent sufferers when it comes to one of the most basic human needs: sanitation. the simple act of relieving themselves is a battle, because public toilets frequently come without proper doors, with no electricity and water supply, with unclean pots and broken seats, poor or no disposal facilities for sanitary napkins. and always, there is the looming fear of harassment and abuse. they must plan their movements based on access to hygienic and safe toilets, reducing their food and water intake so they can avoid going to the toilet through the day., the issue with public toilets is not limited to the women living in open spaces and slums alone. according to nandita gandhi, co-director, akshara centre, the problem cuts across classes, and is as important for working women. “it is a real issue for women who are travelling long distances to work. where are they supposed to go? many of them end up suffering from urinary tract infections.” this leads to women having to calculate their daily path to work, based on the assumption of no toilets if they are on the road, or the distance to the one they could be most comfortable using., absent in policy, mumbai has 8,482 public and community toilet blocks, with 39,402 seats for women and 42,511 for men, according to the brihanmumbai municipal corporation (bmc) portal (see little relief in sight). however, the report ‘toilet torture’, commissioned by the observer research foundation and based on a bmc study undertaken in 2014, stated that nearly 58% of the community toilets in the slums had no electricity, and 78% had no water. the problem was graver for pregnant women and mothers of young children. “pregnant women are scared to go into the jungle due to the fear of falling,” the study says. “so, a preferable way for them is to relieve themselves in the saree and then wash it. the children also end up relieving themselves on the road as they can’t go into the jungle alone.”, in the years since that study, the swacch bharat mission has been making headlines. but just how much has changed on the ground?, “sanitation is a governance issue,” said payal tiwari, author of the study. “during our fieldwork, we found that even as people had the resources and the will to find space to build a toilet, they were not provided with a sewer connection by their corporator.”, on february 1, union finance minister arun jaitley announced that the overall allocation for swachh bharat mission for both urban and rural areas was proposed to be raised to ₹17,843 crore in 2018-19 (from ₹16,248 crore in 2017-18). however, the allocation for the mission for 2017-18 had been raised to ₹19,248 crore as per revised estimates, which means this is actually a near-₹2,000 crore dip in the allocation. ms. tiwari says, “the entire scheme has been more about propaganda. there is no clear blueprint in place to address issues related to solid waste management, cleanliness, maintenance and access. public sanitation has got to be more than just about building new infrastructure.”, dr. amita bhide, head, school of habitat studies, tata institute of social sciences (tiss) says that while the government has been finding answers to issues related to floor space index and transferable development rights to cope with demand for housing, “sanitation remains one of the most neglected dimensions in planning. the toilet is the most practical, short-term, everyday need for both men and women. however, the standard that we have set for ourselves in constructing a toilet as a public amenity is so low that we do not look at women’s sanitation as more than just peeing.”, inadequate, expensive, there have been efforts to construct and maintain community toilets in the various slum pockets across the city, some free and others pay-to-use. but the mere existence of a toilet does not mean access to sanitation for women., especially for those from the lowest end of the economic spectrum, like migrant women living in open spaces and slums, the cost of a pay-toilet — ₹2 to ₹10 — is a deterrent, so they will eat and drink less during the day and defecate in the open before the sun comes up. shweta tambe, project director, committee for right to housing said, ""families end up spending a substantial amount of money on just using the toilet. imagine a family of four members, with each member having to use the toilet at least twice a day... it is a huge sum to pay especially if they are on a daily wage. in fact, women might end up eating less or drinking less water just to reduce the number of toilet visits. in nargis dutt nagar in bandra, the public toilet is on the main road. it is very discomforting for women to queue up outside."", public toilets in the city are managed by the bmc, mhada and mmrda, depending on the ownership of land where the toilet stands. as part of bmc’s slum sanitation programme, 10% of funds to construct toilets come from the slum communities and the rest is funded by , the corporation. currently, there are 750 toilet blocks in the city as part of this programme with access passes issued to local users. , non-government organisations have constructed pay-toilets with permission from bmc, and they are expected to maintain them for a set number of years. people are expected to pay to use them for a variety of sanitary purposes, including bathing and washing clothes. finally, local area development funds of mps and mlas are used to construct toilets on land owned by mhada, but there is no onus on anyone to maintain them., mumtaz sheikh, who spearheads the right to pee campaign, says that most toilets were constructed a long time ago, and have not been structurally audited, which is why there are innumerable cases of toilet floors collapsing. and as a result of sub-contracting the work, “even if someone has a complaint about , the toilet, they are not addressed, as nobody knows who is ultimately responsible for them.”, ms. sheikh believes that the lack of a vision also comes from a perception that toilets are dirty spaces, best constructed at a distance. “usually toilets are built next to an overflowing garbage dump,” she notes, and seen through the same lens. “so, there is nobody to clean them. railway platforms have food stalls right in the centre, but the toilets are only on one of the platforms and only towards the end, with hardly any light, which also makes them corners for drug addicts.”, the safety issue, ms. sheikh says that there has been a marked improvement, with more toilets visible along highways. but aside from access to water and lighting, there , is also concern about safety. “men do not have to worry about safety as much as women.”, ms. dias from azad nagar says they always live in fear of drug addicts who stare at them as they attend nature’s call; the boys carry blades or cutters for use if the women dare question them. “once a lady got her hip cut. we don’t risk it now and only make use of stones around the railway tracks for defence. screaming for help is not a solution.”, in december 2017, akshara centre in collaboration with un women, safetypin and uber, released their safety audit in mumbai, which brought to the fore the harassment experienced by women in the city due to poor facilities. “in so many cases, the doors of toilets are broken, there are no lights,” says ms. gandhi of akshara. “the roads leading to the toilets are also dimly lit. in fact, even if they put one light in the toilet, we can solve half the problem related to access for women.”, in 2017, tiss audited access to sanitation in m-east ward. in the 400 households of bhim nagar, the institute's researchers found that women preferred to go to an open space to relieve themselves before sunrise and after sunset. however, they still encountered men who harassed them or even photographed the act. purva dewoolkar who is part of the ‘transforming m ward’ project initiated by tiss, says the women chipped in their own money to create an enclosed structure with tin sheets. , no place for loos, according to the national policy on sanitation, there has to be a toilet every 500 metres, and the density of toilets has to be one seat for every 35 men, and one seat for every 25 women., seema redkar, former special officer with the bmc and now a consultant on sanitation for the tata trusts, says the deficit must be addressed not just by getting the funds but also factoring in the city's space constraints. “if ‘toilets for all’ has to be implemented,” she says, “then bmc would have to ensure that sewage lines are installed in every community, and this is not something that can be done overnight. it would require foresight and a well-networked plan. besides, 55% of mumbai's land is privately owned, so nobody wants a toilet in their vicinity.” in several older housing compounds in mumbai, there is a space for large dustbins and toilets that drivers and domestic workers use. she suggests this concept could be reintroduced, perhaps making these pay-toilets, or for a set of users., ideally, ms. redkar says every public space — parks, gardens, railway stations — should have a toilet. “we must also make it compulsory for restaurants to construct toilets, and allow people to use them,” she says. “only well-dressed women are allowed to enter a restaurant or hotel to use the bathroom.” all national highways should have toilets, as per the national policy on sanitation. citing the example of toilets at petrol pumps that are perceived to be safer, ms. redkar says, “toilets at public spaces , should not be constructed in isolation, but be in the vicinity of other establishments to ensure more footfall and better maintenance.”, in march 2017, the south delhi municipal corporation issued a notification that made it mandatory for all restaurants and hotels under its jurisdiction to allow any member of the public to use their toilets by paying up to ₹5., civic plans, kiran dighavkar, assistant municipal commissioner, a ward, and nodal officer at bmc for the swachh bharat abhiyan, says that mumbai has 8,100 pay-and-use toilet blocks, with 10,000 such community toilet blocks in the slums. “the ideal ratio of people to toilets is still not there, but we are working on it. the current ratio of persons per seat is anywhere between 75 and 150. by march, we will be adding 2,000 seats in the city. we are now identifying locations to build more toilets.”, mr. dighavkar says that the corporation’s focus will now be on constructing free toilets and it has allocated ₹50 crore for this. “earlier, we used to give land, somebody would invest money, construct the toilet, and with ₹2 per use, it was revenue for them. but the better way, to cut overcharging and ensure maintenance, is to do away with these toilets, construct our own toilets, and maintain them through outside agencies. the housekeeping agency will be given a fee for maintenance, so that the public can use the toilets for free.”, the bmc budget has moved in this direction by providing for ₹500 crore for the construction of 20,000 toilets over the next three years. many new toilets will be replacing existing structures. , a beginning has also been made on feminine hygiene, mr. dighavkar says. bmc schools now have sanitary napkin vending machines, and, “we are now promoting that all public toilets also have these machines. inox has said they will install these, as well as in the women’s toilet inaugurated on saturday. initially we are looking at tapping , corporate social responsibility (csr) funds for this.” and with women-only toilets, “the issue of them not being safe does not arise.”, better, but enough?, ms. redkar says she has noticed a positive shift in the scope of public toilets. “there is a sense of ownership of toilet blocks. due to the bmc’s slum adoption programme, most of the contractors are women, and people have been demanding better amenities. there is a large demand for individual toilets, and at the same time, people are also ready to contribute to get better amenities.”, ms. shaikh is not entirely convinced that punishment for open defecation and using csr funds are answers; there needs to be a long-term plan. “we need to take the voices of the communities, and have them decide what works best for them,” she says. “otherwise, these ideas of new toilets created with csr funds perceive communities as people without any stake. this is also the case with the swacch bharat campaign: it is a good idea, but where is the blueprint? we are being taxed for it, but where is the audit of those funds? what are the long-term goals?”, till that outlook changes, till those blueprints are put down, women like ms. dias, ms. narayankar and ms. jagde will have to grit their teeth and bear with it., inputs by siddhee washimkar, a long way to go, • in

2018-02-09, 50% of swachh bharat funds remains unused,"half of the funds ever released for sanitation projects under the centre’s swachh bharat mission remained unused by delhi’s civic bodies and government agencies as of the end of 2017, a delhi government report showed. , at a time the delhi government is in the process of finalising its budget for 2018-2019, a report about the amount released and utilised for swachh bharat mission compiled by the urban development department shows that a total of ₹149.86 crore was released as on december 31, 2017. of that, the civic bodies and the government agencies were able to spend ₹74.87 crore, with ₹74.99 crore remaining unused as on december 31, 2017., of the amount used, the majority went to projects of solid waste management (₹52.68 crore), followed by construction of community toilets (₹9.99 crore) and aiding construction of individual household toilets (₹7.80 crore). in addition, ₹4.24 crore was used for information, education and communication costs and ₹14.89 lakh on capacity building. , share of funding, an official of the urban development department said that the funds were disbursed by the centre in financial years 2014-2015 and 2015-2016 and the delhi government added its share and released the total amount to the civic bodies and agencies. , since the funds have not been utilised fully, additional funds for swachh bharat mission projects were not released in subsequent years, said the official. according to the swachh bharat mission guidelines, the civic bodies are expected to put in their share of funding before they are given the money from the centre and the state. , while the new delhi municipal council and the south delhi municipal corporation have been able to use 100% and 97% of the funds released to them, the other municipalities and departments lag behind., the north delhi municipal corporation has spent 22%, the east delhi municipal corporation 53% and the delhi cantonment board 47%

funds by the end of this financial year or return some of the funds. , cash crunch, explaining the reason behind the unused funds, a senior official of the north corporation said the civic body was not being able to make its contribution towards projects because of cash crunch. “in many cases the ratio of the centre and the civic body’s contribution is either 70:30 or 80:20. the sad part is that the north corporation is facing a major shortage of funds and does not even have the resources to make 20% of the contribution,” the official said. the official said that despite initiating several revenue generation projects, the income has been low., in the edmc, which is also reeling under a financial crisis, a major portion of the allocated funds have been utilised in public awareness programmes and building of public toilets., “we have decided to go to the basics. toilets are being built at every neighbourhood and market. the resident welfare associations are also being roped in

2018-03-05, no time for school: why lakhs of children are missing the bus,"the solution to india’s sanitation crisis lies in following simple hygiene practices. | photo credit: hul , swati is all of eight years old and the youngest of her parents’ four children. she goes to class 3 at a government primary school. when swati’s class teacher told her parents that she is one of the most intelligent and curious children in her class, they were the proudest parents in harnirpur. uttar pradesh. having dropped out early from school, swati’s parents wanted her to achieve a life that they could only dream of. they wanted her to finish her schooling and then go to college in the city. it was not just studies that swati liked to do. she could beat the boys of the village at cricket on her day and she is also being taught to sing by one of the didis, trained in classical music., swati’s parents do everything within their means to make sure that she grows up to become a very talented girl. so, her father makes sure he gets nutritious food especially for swati. but there is one thing that worries swati’s parents. she has been almost always sick. she has already fallen ill due to diarrhea twice this monsoon and half the monsoon has already passed. she has missed three weeks of classes and is now unable to comprehend her mathematics lessons. she is now visibly thinner and shorter than her cousin whose family lives in the city. the doctor at the taluk headquarters hospital tells the parents that swati is malnourished. her father has made sure that he has done everything right. in spite of that how swati has remained malnourished?, according to the national family health survey - 4 (nfhs-4) 2015-16, 38.4 per cent of india's children in the age group of 0-59 months are stunted which is substantially higher than the world average of 22.9% (joint malnutrition country dataset, may 2017, unicef, who and world bank group), as an emerging economic superpower, it is quite tragic that more than one in three children in india are stunted. stunting is defined by un1cef as the percentage of children, aged 0 to 59 months, whose height for age is below minus two standard deviations (moderate and severe stunting) and minus three standard deviations (severe stunting) from the median of the who child growth standards. stunting is associated with an underdeveloped brain, with long-lasting harmful consequences, including diminished mental ability and learning capacity, poor school performance in childhood, reduced earnings and increased risks of nutrition-related chronic diseases, such as diabetes, hypertension, and obesity in future. thus stunting can be classified by itself as an illness as it leads to negatively affecting the present and future of the child. multiple researchers have proven the link between illness and malnutrition/ stunting in children., these children’s bodies divert energy and nutrients away from growth and brain development to prioritize infection-fighting survival. when this happens during the first two years of life, children become stunted. what’s particularly disturbing is that, the lost height and intelligence are permanent” - jean humphrey, professor of human nutrition at johns hopkins bloomberg school of public health., higher economic growth and increased spending on nutrition access programmes have not resulted in proportionate decrease in child malnutrition or stunting. alternatively, research shows that india's issues can be explained through the lack of hygiene., in addition, 9.2 % of the children are suffering from diarrhea at any given point of time (prevalence of diarrhea (reported) in the last two weeks preceding the survey (%) -nfhs 2015-16). this leads to loss of school hours and an inability to enjoy their childhood fully., the causes for swati’s inability to reach her full potential is the same. swati, her family and the whole of her entire village defecate in the open. also, at her home, they do not boil or filter water before drinking. and the soap is only used for bathing and rarely used for washing hands. doctor saheb tells them that it is not enough to eat nutritious food, but the family must ensure that hygienic habits are followed., the solution to india's water, sanitation and hygiene crisis lies in 3 simple habits:haath,muh andbum, swati’s story is from last year. changes are visible in her village. the government has encouraged the villagers to build toilets as part of the swachh bharat mission. hindustan unilever limited's swachh aadat, swachh bharat has covered swati’s village as part of two of their initiatives. hul's factory workers have visited swati’s village as part of the swachhata doot initiative. using mobile phones they have spread the message of using and maintaining clean toilets, drinking boiled or filtered water and washing hands with soap and the villagers have promised to maintain the hygiene habits. a 21-day swachh aadat curriculum on right habits has been introduced in her school. today, all of her friends are messengers of change in their village. swati’s family follows the three clean habits. her future looks much brighter and the next mithali raj is in the making., “defecating in the open is the main cause of many diseases. not only does it cause damage to the drinking water and food that we consume, but also directly affects the functioning of human hands and legs., the women and children are mostly affected with anaemia. this is in fact caused by intestinal worms caused by the bacteria from the faeces caused by defecating in the open. the practice of using washrooms should be insisted right from childhood. it will bring an end to most of the diseases created."", -

model on ground building over one lakh toilets. a behavior change programme is currently being implemented in chittoor district in andhra pradesh to increase usage of toilets and encourage proper maintenance of toilets., the lifebuoy handwashing behaviour change programme is amongst the largest handwashing initiatives in the world. the initiatives help in promoting the benefits of handwashing

toilets. hul has multiple initiatives to change behavior including swachhata doot, swachh basti programme, the swachhata curriculum and media campaigns promoting hygiene practices., swachhata doot is a mobile-led rural behaviour change communication model, wherein volunteers can become agents of behavior change in india’s villages. they share two-minute audio stories on clean habits through their mobile phones. they reach out to school children, parents and community members thereby positively impacting rural communities. the programme has successfully reached over 30 lakh people with the message of cleanliness since inception., the swachh aadat curriculum is a 21- day behaviour change curriculum for primary school students. reaching them young ensures that the knowledge about the importance of clean habits and the positive attitudes towards clean habits are picked up early. the curriculum is taught in classrooms with the help of teachers for approximately 20 minutes for 21 continuous working days. the curriculum combines classroom teaching with practical demonstrations and characters, like chamatkari sonu (a superhero) and kitabyutor (kitab + computer), activities, games etc., are used effectively. the curriculum has so far been taught in schools in parts of rural uttar pradesh and maharashtra., , the suvidha centre is a first-of-its-kind urban water, hygiene and sanitation community centre that addresses the hygiene needs of people from low-income urban households who face severe challenges due to lack of infrastructure and facilities. it provides toilets that flush, handwashing facilities with soap, clean showers, safe drinking water and laundry facilities at significantly lower costs than market. the first suvidha centre in azad nagar, ghatkopar, one of the largest slums in mumbai is running for more than a year and has attained operational sustainability. the ‘suvidha’ project would be expanded with more such centres being built at other slums of mumbai., for success to be achieved, it is essential that everyone with a similar mission, work together towards the common goal. hul partners with ngos, development organisations and the government to work together towards common goals. the village social transformation mission is an initiative by the government of maharashtra and top private sector companies to develop the 1000 most backward

the changes to the national council of educational research and training (ncert) textbooks, the draft education policy, and the problem of vacant seats in engineering colleges. excerpts:, as far as higher education is concerned, i am worried for those who graduate every year. i agree that the existing curriculum does not create the necessary professional skills. therefore we are planning to introduce ba (professional), b.com (professional), and b.sc courses where students will get 1,000 hours of additional courseware, 250 hours of soft skills and 250 hours of ict information and communication technology skills so that after graduation they become employable. we are planning the course work so that by june 19 we will be able to introduce this to students. this will be available through the ugc university grants commission, the aicte all india council for technical education, so that it becomes available for all colleges in the country., at least my party has a vision, which was spelt out in our 2014 election manifesto. we had emphasis on quality research, and values to be inculcated in students. we have taken a 360-degree view on education., today the government is spending nearly 4%. it is an increase of 70% over the 2013-14 budget. let’s celebrate this. even states are increasing their budgets for education. it is inching close to 6%. we will reach it., this is a classic case of unplanned, unsustainable growth and oversupply of engineering seats because of two things. during the upa regime, all kinds of permissions were given by aicte. whoever wanted to set up an engineering college was granted permission. the aicte’s authority runs only in affiliated colleges. new private colleges, new deemed universities and state universities have increased their intake tremendously because they are quality institutes — the issue is one of oversupply because aicte cannot intervene. we wish to correct the act so that aicte’s reign continues in all engineering institutes, which is not the case right now., second, now students are choosing where they want to go, and obtain reviews before joining. so, in a way, lower quality institutes will go out and the good will stay. that is a good development. we received 100-150 applications for closure of colleges., it is always a case of somebody breaching the code. in bank atms, there is a foolproof arrangement, yet breaches happen. we will be alert. we have put processes in place. we don’t want to put more things in the public domain. our system is foolproof but if somebody breaches the system, it is a criminal act and the person will be tried under the law., it was one man’s hunger to become headmaster at an early stage, prompted by one lady who said she would help him become headmaster but he must give her two papers. these were the two papers that went viral on social media. that is what the leak was all about. all are arrested., the draft legislation has undergone many changes. first, it was an overarching architecture that the upa’s hrd minister kapil sibal wanted to bring and it was opposed by his own party members. we want to make the processes of the three regulators the same, with increased transparency., we are in the process of discussing it. we need to have more transparency, so that there is no malpractice or corruption. if it comes as a law, so be it., i don’t think so. actually, we don’t regulate anything. the whole inspection process is about the area, ownership and the building. nobody is talking about learning outcomes. nobody is talking about the teaching processes and placements. we want to shift the focus of the regulators to these areas., we have only updated and corrected it, which is a usual exercise. we do not have the committees to redraft and rewrite the curriculum and we have not formed a committee to do this. last year we asked teachers for their suggestions for updating and for correcting erroneous information. we received 1,100 suggestions and we have carried out a little over 700 suggestions., no, i don’t think so. since 2011, knowledge tradition and practices in india is a good course by the cbse. any student who reads that will get correct scientific information. we have only introduced government schemes like swachh bharat, make in india., i think the issue is settled. our mp asked for information on something and it was misunderstood., i would not like to comment on that., state universities don’t seek funds from us. private universities have nothing to ask from us. deemed universities also don’t ask from us. only central universities and centrally funded deemed universities are what the centre finances. as far as central finance is concerned, the centre will give all the money required., but in graded autonomy, this freedom given is their choice if they want to take it. we have not mandated that they have to take it. as far as centrally funded institutions are concerned, the fund regulations will apply. because if finance minister arun jaitley writes the budget, we can’t delegate budget-writing to institutes. so, they will have to submit financial approvals as regular financial approvals., autonomous colleges are not something we have invented. it has been there from the 1970s and there are 635 autonomous colleges working smoothly in our country. there are another 350 applications pending. so, we process them. as far as delhi university is concerned, we said it is not mandatory. it is your choice. as far as financial approvals are concerned, you will have to stick to our original framework. and academic freedom to conduct examinations, on the syllabus... that is the freedom they get. conducting the examination, evaluation of papers — everything remains with the college, if they want to. but if they don’t want, we are not mandating. we are also not increasing fees in any way because of this. but if they have to expand and they want

stop it, you rockstar, stop it., then comes some more super-good news. i speak of the primary aim of this apparel brand., apparently, patanjali paridhan will be mainly targeting women. isn’t that wonderful? targeting women. that’s really what we are about, aren’t we? , patanjali says it will be concentrating on making special, thoughtfully designed jeans for the devotion-worthy sisters and mothers of this ancient land. speaking about the usp (unique shuddh prastaav) of their product, acharya balakrishna, that ubiquitous judy to baba ramdev’s irrepressible punch, said, “our jeans for women will be loose so that they comply with indian cultural norms, and are also comfortable for them. indian families will find our swadeshi jeans concept very comfortable.”, cultural comfort. now that is the operative phrase. , see, this is where they will score over foreign brands. babaji has figured what a mahila wears is not just about her comfort. but the entire family’s, the colony’s, why, even the country’s comfort, dammit. , say no more, babaji. being your undying (hopefully) admirer, i will guess the rest., as a first step, i think the inner-side of the jeans will have portraits of alok nath, sambit patra and pahlaj nihalani, sporting their most disapprovingly sanskari expressions. so that the female wearer is reminded of our ancient culture and the strict code of conduct she has to adhere to, even as she steps into the garment., two, considering that the latest technology is as familiar to patanjali as panchgavya (ref: electricity from bulls), i predict this innovation in the garment. at the first sign of a father, father-in-law or village headman, the shuddh bharat jeans will eject a serpentine pallu from the back pocket, with which the wearer-beti can cover her head. quickly. and get into the prescribed demure position to serve tea or thandai (depending on taste)., three, the jeans, being thoughtfully loose, will be equipped with special pockets that come pre-fitted with the must-haves for the indian woman: a handy rolling pin to make perfectly circular rotis for the husband, a nifty three-pack of patanjali noodles for when he is in a hurry, say, to attend anti-romeo squad briefing. but patanjali realises being a woman isn’t only about duty. so, i suspect, there will be dandiyas, too, in case the beti feels a need to participate in a family-approved flash garbha., since babaji and yoga cannot be separated, even with industrial forceps, i see this feature clearly. the jeans will have a kapalbhati app. the patanjali sim will activate this feature once every three hours or so, making the wearer spontaneously break into the swachh-bharat-health-promoting-paroxysmic-ab move in trains, at public parks and funerals. , next, this might appear minor but it’s not: the label. unlike the diabolical labels of levi’s and wrangler, ours won’t be made of – heaven forbid – leather. it will be made of sacred gobar, flattened into strips. , finally, the sizes. i see the shuddh desi nari jeans coming in these sizes: beti, bahu, saas, and xx-saas-bhi-kabhi-bahu.",0.273885989010989,"jean therapy , patanjali style","sreejith r kumar &#124; photo credit : sreejith r kumar , drop-everything-this-instant alert phone. ’ whenever tmk , john abraham , , baba ramdev makes announcement. ’ yet recover delirious joy patanjali sim desi messaging service , see goes does. , shuddh bharat desi jeans ( brand name patanjali paridhan ) available december 2018 ! , much joy one take ?

2018-08-18, no child left behind ,", the urgency to address poor nutrition in india, especially among children, adolescent girls and women is compelling, and re-confirmed in virtually every survey — from nfhs-4 in 2015-16 (the latest available information), to the global nutrition report 2016 and the global hunger index (ghi) 2017, which ranks india at 100 out of 119 countries, with a low overall score of 31.4. among children less than 5 years, wasting (low weight for height), continues to be 21% in the 2017 index — it was 20% in 1992. there has been a reduction in stunting (height for age) – from 61.9% in 1992 to 38.4% in 2017, reported in the ghi 2017. mortality among children less than 5 years old has declined to around 5% from 11% during the same period, according to both the ghi and the nfhs. however, 25% of india’s children less than 5 years old are still malnourished., add to this the fact that 190.7 million people in india sleep hungry every night, and over half of adolescent girls and women are anaemic, and the conclusion is obvious — despite a 7% compound annual growth rate over the last decade and the various programmes to improve nutrition, levels of under-nutrition are unacceptably high., this grim reality has rightly lead to a renewed emphasis to address the various forms of poor nutrition – stunted, wasted, anaemic and underweight children; anaemic girls and women, especially in the 15-49 age group. the recently announced flagship program of the ministry of women and child development will be anchored through the national nutrition mission (nnm), or poshan abhiyaan, with its own specific budget of ₹9,046 crore and a proposed world bank loan of $200 million, to ensure convergence among the various programmes of the government. additionally, niti aayog has worked on a national nutrition strategy (nns), isolated the 100 most backward districts for stunting and prioritised those for interventions., a cynical view would be that we have seen such declarations before – after all, the special attention to nutrition was highlighted in 2008 when the prime minister’s national council on india’s nutrition challenges was constituted. a detailed report, “addressing india’s nutrition challenges”, was submitted in 2010 by the planning commission, the convergence of an extensive and multi-sector consultation. but nothing changed significantly., the optimistic view says that exploring new models to address the structural and systemic issues on a priority basis, learning from what has worked or not, and single-minded focus on implementation will be critical to delivering better nutritional outcomes and meeting the sustainable development goals, to which india is a signatory. additionally, initiatives like swachh bharat abhiyan, where implemented, will contribute positively to nutrition outcomes, and well-structured public-private partnerships could be the catalyst., seen in this context, the overhaul of capacity and capability in three existing programmes, designed to reach populations most at risk, should be the first priority — namely, the integrated child development services (icds), with its network of 1.4 million anganwadi centres, reaching almost 100 million beneficiaries who include pregnant and nursing mothers and children up to 6 years; mid-day meals (mdm) that reach almost 120 million children in schools; and the public distribution system (pds) that reaches over 800 million people under the national food security act., the national nutrition strategy (nns) has set very ambitious targets for 2022 and the poshan abhiyaan has also specified three-year targets to reduce stunting, under-nutrition and low birth weight by 2% each year, and to reduce anaemia by 3% each year. for purposeful action, it is imperative to have common goals and metrics for improving nutrition, which can then be disaggregated by year, state, district, etc., into a nutrition dashboard, with metrics that are clear and measurable and a real-time tracking mechanism, much like we track economic data. it is interesting to note that the national nutrition monitoring bureau (nnmb), established in 1972, was dissolved in 2015., both the nns and the nnm have recognised the criticality of working collaboratively across ministries; yet both are silent on the constructive role that the private sector, development agencies and civil society can and must play in realising these ambitious goals. altering the fundamentals of poor nutrition requires multiple and sustained interventions over a period of time — increased availability and accessibility of nutritious food, potable water, hygiene and sanitation, primary health care, etc. the approach, commitment and resources therefore have to be inter-generational, multi-sector, multi-dimensional and multi-year. to simplify a complex issue, the challenge for india is to simultaneously address insufficient and poor diets, inadequate hygiene and sanitation and better management of disease and infections., success in this domain will be driven by coordinated action on multiple fronts, but there are at least three urgent priorities., one, to adequately re-engineer the icds, mdm and pds for greater effectiveness. this is an ideal initiative for public-private partnerships as the strength of good private sector companies is in creating and designing frameworks, structures, processes and metrics for action, implementation and tracking. for example, involving the best nutritionists to work with local communities on calorie and nutrition dense supplementary foods, using easily available local ingredients that are within the icds and mdm budget guidelines, and produced by self-help groups, could easily be anchored by the relevant private sector and development agencies, working with state governments, and considered a corporate social responsibility initiative. the key advantages of this disaggregated supply model are that it engages local communities, generates employment and ensures minimal leakage as it works with and inside the community. this will also ensure that space and other constraints of lack of hygiene at anganwadi centres do not become impediments in the supply of nutritious food., two, to mandate and scale staple food fortification comprising edible oil, wheat, rice and dairy products, in addition to salt. there is persuasive evidence from several countries of the efficacy and cost-effectiveness of large-scale staple food fortification to address “hidden hunger” or micro-nutrient deficiencies. the effectiveness of iodised salt in significantly reducing iodine deficiency is well-established in india empirically. the success of micro-nutrient fortified food is that it does not entail a change in behaviour. considerable work will also have to be done to make fortified rice and wheat available through the pds. this requires addressing the supply chain capability to deliver — another excellent ppp initiative, that has been piloted in several states for edible oil and wheat flour and can easily be replicated. a case in point is the mandate of july and august 2017 to use fortified oil, salt and wheat flour in the icds and mdm by the ministries of women and child development and human resource development, respectively. in the absence of coordination with industry to create an effective supply chain, this proposed intervention will be another missed opportunity. , mandatory fortification with micro-nutrients often sparks an emotional debate, and the way to think about it is that these universally consumed staple foods become the carriers of vitamins and minerals that people need but do not get in sufficient quantity from the food they consume.",0.11507183176300828,child left behind,", urgency address poor nutrition india , especially among children , adolescent girls women compelling , re-confirmed virtually every survey — nfhs-4 2015-16 ( latest available information ) , global nutrition report 2016 global hunger index ( ghi ) 2017 , ranks india 100 119 countries , low overall score 31.4. among children less 5 years , wasting ( low weight height ) , continues 21 % 2017 index — 20 % 1992. reduction stunting ( height age ) – 61.9 % 1992 38.4 % 2017 , reported ghi 2017. mortality among children less 5 years old declined around 5 % 11 % period , according ghi nfhs. however , 25 % india ’ children less 5 years old still malnourished. , add fact 190.7 million people india sleep hungry every night , half adolescent girls women anaemic , conclusion obvious — despite 7 % compound annual growth rate last decade various programmes improve nutrition , levels under-nutrition unacceptably high. , grim reality rightly lead renewed emphasis address various forms poor nutrition – stunted , wasted , anaemic underweight children ;

2018-08-22,swachh to target open urination too,"under new norms, cities and towns wanting to be declared odf+ (open defecation free plus) must also be free of public urination and not just open defecation. this is the first time that the swachh bharat mission (urban) is officially including the elimination of public urination in its agenda. , the rural division of sbm had previously said preventing public urination was not on their agenda., the mission is focussed on infrastructure and regulatory changes, on the assumption that this will lead to behaviour change. , “cities are different from rural areas,” sbm-u mission director vinod kumar jindal told the hindu. , “in the case of urban areas, the problem is not one of usage, but of availability...in cities, if toilets are available, accessible and clean, people will automatically use them rather than using the road.”, sustainability is key, the odf+ and odf++ protocols, which were released by the ministry of housing and urban affairs last week, are the next step for the sbm-u and aim to ensure sustainability in sanitation outcomes. , the original odf protocol, issued in march 2016, said, “a city/ward is notified as odf city/ward if, at any point of the day, not a single person is found defecating in the open.” so far, 2,741 cities have been certified as odf, based mostly on third-party verification of toilet construction., the new odf+ protocol, issued last week, says that a city, ward or work circle could be declared odf+ if, “at any point of the day, not a single person is found defecating and/or urinating in the open, and all community and public toilets are functional and well-maintained.”, the odf++ protocol adds the condition that “faecal sludge/septage and sewage is safely managed and treated, with no discharging and/or dumping of untreated faecal sludge/septage and sewage in drains, water bodies or open areas.” “urination has always been implied as part of the odf agenda,” said mr. jindal. “that’s why there is a subsidy for urinals, not just toilets.” however, he admits that third-party verification of odf areas, being carried out by the quality council of india, has not so far checked for public urination. that will be done under the odf+ protocol, he said., “it is currently impractical to include urination,” said nitya jacob, a water and sanitation policy expert. he pointed out that public urination, especially by men, is almost entirely a behaviour change issue. even men who have access to toilets use the roads as a public urinal., mr. jindal disagrees. “in urban areas, no one wants to do it. they are forced to do it because of the lack of clean toilets,” he said, emphasising the need for cleanliness, accessibility and visibility. the odf+ protocol lays down 20 specific conditions across cleanliness, support infrastructure, accessibility and operations and maintenance. , the mission is also pushing forward in its drive to get public toilets listed on google maps. a search for “toilets near me” will now display the location of public toilets in over 700 cities, and allow users to rate and review them. “if people can easily find a public toilet, they will not use the road,” said mr. jindal.

2018-08-25,swachh india review: knowledge to policy,"this far-reaching field study evaluates one of india’s most substantial policy commitments, the national rural health mission (nrhm), to arrive at telling and cautionary conclusions. the nrhm identifies 18 states as having weak public health indicators and health infrastructure; the major determinants here are nutrition, water, and sanitation. the mission, furthermore, requires state-level departments dealing with water and sanitation to promote local community involvement. , the research team, based at the centre for economic and social studies, hyderabad, completed the work in 12 months in 2015-16, studying madhya pradesh, odisha and andhra pradesh. the authors acknowledge ministry of health and family welfare funding and support from the ministry’s national health systems resource centre., comprehensive study, this is high-quality empirical social science; the research is meticulous and the book is easy to use. the tables provide a wealth of information; many also give chi-square test results and the corresponding significance levels. in addition, dozens of fieldwork photographs are reproduced., the authors start with a wide literature review, including research from peru and somalia among other countries, and note issues like the commodification of water. in each of the three chosen states, they cover direct health interventions on drinking water and sanitation, the processes whereby different institutions interact over nrhm goals, and the outcomes for individuals’ health and for community processes., the first hypothesis is that in open defecation-free (odf) villages, functioning local bodies and their interactions with panchayati raj institutions (pris) are better than they are in non-odf villages. the second is that the availability of protected water and sanitation may significantly impact household morbidity and the incidence of epidemics at the community level., the sampling could be a textbook example. the multi-stage selection starts with two high-focus nrhm states, madhya pradesh and odisha, and one non-high-focus state, andhra pradesh. in each selected state, the same method is applied to districts, blocks or mandals, and villages; in the study, 36 villages and 720 households figure, with one third of the villages being certified nirmal grams, where all houses, schools, and anganwadis or mother-and-child centres have access to sanitary toilets and all residents know the importance of personal and community hygiene, and of clean public spaces. the sampling frame also required each household to have a child up to the age of five, and included village size, location, class and caste profile, and the availability and quality of water and sanitation facilities., as for the findings, nirmal gram (ngp) villages are better only on certain indices, from infrastructure through water quality and availability to residents’ awareness of the village water and sanitation committees and village health and sanitation committees, and other local interactions. yet several practices, such as throwing small children’s faeces into the road, are common to both categories of villages., class issues, clear class divisions emerge across all villages, with poorer residents often unaware of the dangers of not washing fruit or vegetables before cooking or eating them; in addition, the poorest have to use sand or ash to clean their hands after defecation, as they have almost no easy access to clean water. all respondents, however, had at least one bath a day, though the care of drinking-water vessels varied by social class, as did water supply and water treatment before consumption., some of the figures are shocking. in madhya pradesh, only 13 of the 239 respondents were female, of whom only three were literate; in odisha, the corresponding figures were 30 and 240, with 27 women being literate; in andhra pradesh, 25 of 244 respondents were female, of whom 24 were literate., moreover, on certain health indices, the ngp villages are not much better than the non-ngp ones, despite evidence of official neglect in the latter. the authors conclude that the relevant similarities imply political factors in the selection of villages for ngp certification; they recommend far greater procedural transparency.",0.058322510822510824,swachh india review : knowledge policy,"far-reaching field study evaluates one india ’ substantial policy commitments , national rural health mission ( nrhm ) , arrive telling cautionary conclusions. nrhm identifies 18 states weak public health indicators health infrastructure ;

2018-09-29,external affairs minister sushma swaraj's statement at the 73rd session of the unga,"external affairs minister sushma swaraj addresses the 73rd united nations general assembly, at un headquarters on september 29, 2018. | photo credit: pti , september 29, 2018, your excellency madame president, , may i begin by congratulating you on your election as the president of the 73rd session of the united nations general assembly, on my personal behalf as well as on behalf of my country, india. as a woman, i feel doubly proud that you have this honour. i also recall, with equal pride, that the first woman to occupy this eminent chair was an indian smt. vijayalakshmi pandit, in 1953 during the 8th session. i will also like to thank the outgoing president mr. miroslav lajcak for successfully conducting the 72nd session of the united nations general assembly. , madame president, we received a very bad news this morning that there was an earthquake and tsunami- both these tragedies occurred at the same time - and from this forum on behalf of my country india i would like to express deep condolences to the people and government of indonesia and at the same time i would like to express assurance that india will cooperate in helping during this tragic time. , madame president, , the united nations is the world’s premier multilateral organization: , 1: where nations seek balm for the wounds of history, and a platform for solutions. , 2: where less developed nations sit with their more fortunate brethren to formulate plans that can correct the skewered economic imbalance. , 3: where new goals are set, and route maps defined, to make our world a better place. , in 2015, we established 2030 as a critically important horizon for 17 sustainable development goals. a common refrain, from 2015, has been that we will reach that horizon only if india finds its way to this destination. otherwise, we shall fail., i assure this august gathering through you, madam, that india will not let you fail. we are totally committed to achieving these objectives for our own people. under the leadership of prime minister narendra modi, india has initiated unprecedented economic and social transformation that will help india achieve its sdg goals much before time. , let me offer a few glimpses of evidence to illustrate what is the world’s biggest exercise in poverty elimination and social transformation: , through the jan dhan yojana, world’s largest financial inclusion scheme, over 320 million indians, who had never crossed the door of a bank before, now have bank accounts. this has enabled the poor to receive allotments from the government’s welfare programmes into their personal accounts, through direct benefit transfer, which has ended waste and corruption in the system. , similarly, ayushman bharat, the world’s biggest health insurance programme, was launched by prime minister modi a few days ago on 23rd september. this revolutionary scheme will benefit 500 million indians, who will get an insurance cover of rs 500,000 per family per year. we have a prayer in india: sarve santu niramaya, which means, all should be healthy. the aayushman bharat yojana is the answer to this prayer. , similarly, we have launched the largest housing scheme in the world aimed at ensuring that everyone has a roof above their heads. under the scheme, we have set ourselves a target of nealy 21 million homes by 2022. so far, over five million homes for the poor have already been constructed. , similarly, two extremely effective schemes have been initiated to raise the skill levels of those waiting to be employed through skill development programme and to turn the poor into entrepreneurs, through the mudra programme. i want to stress that over 140 million indians have taken mudra loans. the most significant aspect of mudra scheme is that 76% of the beneficiaries are women., at the heart of prime minister modi’s transformative vision is a radical idea: that the uplift of any nation is best achieved through the all-round empowerment of women. all the schemes that i have just spoken about have the welfare of women at their core. last year, i spoke about the ujjawala scheme, in which i am happy to report 50 million free gas connections have been provided so far. , another such initiative is the maternity benefit scheme, in which women get 26 weeks of paid leave to care for their newborn. madame president, as a woman, you will understand better than most how vitally important this programme is for every mother. some developed nations with huge economies do not offer more than six weeks paid leave, leading to a continuing struggle for more time off. in india, we have implemented what women across the world need. , madam president, in 2022, free india will be 75 years old. prime minister narendra modi has pledged to build a new india by then. this new india will be: , 1: swachh bharat, swasth bharat (clean india, healthy india); , 2: samarth bharat, surakshit bharat (prosperous india, secure india); , 3: shikshit bharat, viksit bharat (educated india, developed india); , 4: urjawan bharat, shaktiman bharat (energised india, strong india). , that is our horizon for india in 2022. we will reach that horizon. , madam president: , the biggest challenge of our era comes from the existential threats of climate change and terrorism. , under-developed and developing nations are the worst victim of climate change. they have neither the capacity nor the resources to meet this crisis. those who have exploited nature for their immediate needs cannot abdicate their responsibilities. if we have to save the world from the adverse effects of climate change, then developed nations must lift the deprived with financial and technical resources. the principle of common and differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities was reiterated in the 2015 paris agreement. , india has risen to meet the challenge of climate change. prime minister modi in partnership with france launched the international solar alliance. the united nations has recognized their contributions and conferred on prime minister modi and president macron the honour of un champions of the earth. i am happy to inform you that 68 nations are now members of isa. in march this year, india and france chaired the founding conference of isa in which 120 countries participated. , our prime minister has described his vision of sustainable and available energy in a typically apt phrase: one sun, one grid. this breakthrough concept can become the solution we seek to the problems. , madam president, i had described terrorism as the second existential threat to humanity. we imagined that the arrival of the 21st century would bring with it an age of common good, defined by cooperation in the quest for peace and prosperity. but here in new york, the horrific tragedy of 9/11, and in mumbai the catastrophe of 26/11 became the nightmares that shattered our dreams. the demon of terrorism now stalks the world, at a faster pace somewhere, a slower pace elsewhere, but life-threatening everywhere. , in our case, terrorism is bred not in some faraway land, but across our border to the west. our neighbour’s expertise is not restricted to spawning grounds for terrorism; it is also an expert in trying to mask malevolence with verbal duplicity., the most startling evidence of this duplicity was the fact that osama bin laden, the architect and ideologue of 9/11 was given safe haven in pakistan. america had declared osama bin laden it’s most dangerous enemy, and launched an exhaustive, worldwide search to bring him to justice. what america perhaps could not comprehend was that osama would get sanctuary in a country that claimed to be america’s friend and ally: pakistan. eventually, america’s intelligence services discovered the truth of this hypocrisy, and its special forces delivered justice. but pakistan continued to behave as if nothing had happened. pakistan’s commitment to terrorism as an instrument of official policy has not abated one bit. neither has its belief in hypocrisy. the killers of 9/11 met their fate; but the mastermind of 26/11 hafiz saeed still roams the streets of pakistan with impunity. , what is heartening is that the world is no longer ready to believe islamabad. fatf, for instance, has put pakistan on notice over terror funding. , madam president, we are accused of sabotaging the process of talks. this is a complete lie. we believe that talks are the only rational means to resolve the most complex of disputes. talks with pakistan have begun many times. if they stopped, it was only because of pakistan’s behavior. there have been many governments in india, by many different parties. each government has tried the peace option. prime minister modi, by inviting the heads of the saarc nations, to his swearing in ceremony, began his attempt for dialogue on his very first day in office. on 9th december 2016, i personally went to islamabad and offered a comprehensive bilateral dialogue. but soon after, pak sponsored terrorists attacked our air force base in pathankot on 2nd january. please explain to me how we could pursue talks in the midst of terrorist bloodshed? even now, after the new government came to power, the prime minister of pakistan imran khan wrote to prime minister modi suggesting a meeting between foreign ministers in new york. we accepted the proposal. but, within hours of our acceptance, news came that terrorists had killed three of our jawans. does this indicate a desire for dialogue? , time and again, pakistan accuses india of human rights violations. who can be a greater transgressor of human rights than a terrorist? those who take innocent human lives in pursuit of war by other means are defenders of inhuman behavior, not of human rights. pakistan glorifies killers; it refuses to see the blood of innocents. , it has become something of a habit with pakistan to throw the dust of deceit and deception against india in order to provide some thin cover for its own guilt. the united nations has seen this before. last year, pakistan’s representative, using her right to reply, displayed some photographs as ""proof” of ""human rights violations” by india. the photographs turned out to be from another country. similar false accusations have become a part of its standard rhetoric. , madam president: , each year, for last five years, india has been arguing from this podium that lists are not enough to check terrorists and their protectors. we need to bring them to accountability through international law. , in 1996, india proposed a draft document on ccit at the united nations. till today, that draft has remained a draft, because we cannot agree on a common language. on the one hand, we want to fight terrorism; on the other, we cannot define it. this is why terrorists with a price on their head are celebrated , finances and armed as liberation heroes by a country that remains a member of the united nations. cruelty and barbarism are advertised as heroism. the country prints postage stamps glorifying terrorists. if we do not act now, we will have to deal with conflagration later. once again, i appeal to this august body to come to an agreement, soon, on ccit as one of the necessary measures in a long running war. , madam president, i began by highlighting the unique and positive role of the un: but i must add that step by slow step, the importance, influence, respect and value of this institution is beginning to ebb. it is time to wonder if we are wandering towards the fate of the league of nations. if 2030 is the agreed deadline for delivery on sustainable development goals, then it also marks hundred years of the lapse of the league into irrelevance. surely there is something to learn from this coincidence? the league went into meltdown because it was unwilling to accept the need for reform. we must not make that mistake. , the united nations must accept that it needs fundamental reform. reform cannot be cosmetic. we need change the institution’s head and heart to make both compatible to contemporary reality. , reform must begin today; tomorrow could be too late. if the un is ineffective, the whole concept of multilateralism will collapse. in this session, there has been much debate about multilateralism. we will never weaken the multilateral mechanism. india believes that the world is a family, and the best means of resolution is shared discourse. a family is shaped by love and is not transactional; a family is nurtured by consideration not greed; a family believes in harmony not jealousy. greed breeds conflict; consideration leads to resolution. that is why the united nations must be based on the principles of the family. the un cannot be run by the ‘i’, it only works by the ‘we’. , india does not believe that the united nations should become the instrument of a few at the cost of the many. india believes that we must move forward together or we sink into the swamp of stagnation. , madam president, this year india will celebrate the 150th birth anniversary of mahatma gandhi. the mahatma’s favourite bhajan was ""vaishnav jan to tene kahiye”. the essence is deeply moving and quintessentially important: he who understands the pain of another, and absorbs it as his own, is a good human being. he who sees this pain, and helps without becoming arrogant, is a good human being’. , madam president, we have to make this assembly into a platform of understanding, assistance and true justice. we have to understand the pain of other nations, and work with developed nations to ease and eliminate this pain. arrogance has no place in our scheme of things; arrogance is counter-productive and self-defeating. let us work for the benefit of the less fortunate. let us work for a world where there is peace, serenity and shared prosperity; a world that is free from terrorism, tension and violence. , it is with this wish in mind that i end with a shloka from our sanskrit scriptures: , may all experience well being;, may all experience peace;",0.12501983046893222,external affairs minister sushma swaraj ' statement 73rd session unga,"external affairs minister sushma swaraj addresses 73rd united nations general assembly , un headquarters september 29 , 2018. &#124;

2018-10-03,‘swachh bharat has become a people’s movement’,"parameswaran iyer, secretary to the drinking water and sanitation ministry. | photo credit: v.v. krishnan , in his office, parameswaran iyer keeps a countdown calendar to october 2, 2019, the deadline for all of india to become ‘open-defecation free’. on tuesday, the countdown dipped to ‘365 days left’. despite some aberrations, the swachh bharat abhiyan-gramin has taken massive strides towards its goal. but mr. iyer knows that his biggest test will come after the countdown reaches zero: sustaining the gains will be the toughest challenge, he says. excerpts:, first, the fact that this programme has really caught on as a jan andolan. it has become a ‘people’s movement’. it has captured the imagination of the country. it has addressed centuries-old practices on open defecation, and it has had major health and economic impact. a recent world health organisation (who) report has said that by the time swachh bharat ends in 2019, more than 3,00,000 lives would have been saved., we have got the numbers: 24 states have become open-defecation free. the number of toilets built is 8.6 crore. sanitation coverage has gone up from 39% when we started four years ago to over 93% today. what is even more significant is that, according to the most recent independent survey, as part of a world bank-supported project, the usage of the toilets is 93%., that really shows that this whole behavioural change programme that is at the heart of swachh bharat — there is evidence that it is really working. behavioural change at scale — i think that was the biggest challenge., we are very clear that this programme is primarily about changing behaviour. now, obviously you need the infrastructure. we are trying to separate human contact with excreta and the most cost-efficient way of doing that is by providing a toilet. they have to be built, and there has been a remarkable increase in the number of toilets. but we are more interested in toilet usage., we deploy tools at two levels. one is through mass media, the other through interpersonal communication. we have been working on developing an army of foot soldiers called swachhagrahis, grass-root level motivators trained in community approaches and they go out to trigger behavioural change. they get their communities to accept responsibility and accountability. that ground game, that interpersonal communication, is important not just to achieve open defecation free (odf) status, but also to sustain it., and they’re being used., you have touched upon a very important point: sustaining the gains of odf. this is one of the biggest differences between this programme and the previous ones. we have a parallel programme called odf sustainability — and we have not lost contact with states that have become odf. there is continued engagement. there is also focus on ‘odf plus’, which is about solid and liquid waste management and swachhata in general., let me just take you through the process of declaration of a state as odf. it’s quite rigorous. first, there is self declaration by the village in an open aam sabha. then there is verification by an agency from the district level or block level. then, the state government sometimes does sample verification and so do we. so, the process is fairly robust, and then we have got this national rural annual survey., if there are specific cases in rajasthan, they need to be addressed. whenever we get a case where someone reports to us that somewhere there is a problem on the ground, or a toilet is not constructed, or someone is still going out to the open — they may be isolated cases — we refer it to the state., all the feedback we get from our colleagues on the ground says that one of the reasons this programme is so successful is because of the energy, the enthusiasm of the campaign. the fact that it has been done in campaign mode is what brings everyone together. the earlier approach was: ‘drip, drip, drip’. you don’t get anywhere with a ‘drip, drip’ method. you have got to build up momentum., if you talk to the collectors, all the people who were the pioneers for their districts, whether it is in bengal or whether it’s in rajasthan, all of them said, “if you don’t do this in campaign mode, if you don’t get everyone in the district together, all segments, elected representatives, women, swachhagrahis, sarpanchs, it is very difficult to do it over an extended period of time. you cannot sustain the enthusiasm.”, we have reached 93% coverage and eventually, we are going to get to 100%, and i think well before the october 2019 deadline set by the prime minister., i think it is really important now to focus upon sustaining the odf status. in some ways, this is even more challenging than achieving it in campaign mode, because this is something that has to be done on a continuous basis. people have got to understand that sustaining the gains is going to take time, it has got to get ingrained., this is something we have been focussing on and we have got to focus even more. we are convinced that this twin-pit model, which can be used in most parts of rural india, can actually create a treatment plant in itself. the big problem with septic tanks is the disposal of the sludge. sludge management is not a problem when you talk of the twin pit. now of course, that needs to be propagated better, so we are now trying to market it as a colour tv, not as a black and white tv. we have got some of our swachh bharat ambassadors like amitabh bachchan and akshay kumar doing promotion. masons are being trained. we have got a big collaboration with the ministry of skill development., typically, for a family of four or five, five to six years., this is part of the training and the awareness campaign, that when one of your pits fills up, in five to six years, this is what you need to do. you need to divert it to the second pit. when the first pit is closed for more than a year, then you can take out the compost. it is harmless, pathogen-free, and it is a great organic fertiliser., part of the training we are providing is about retrofitting. wherever there are deficiencies in construction, in some cases where there are single pits, you can retrofit them to second pits., in a rural context, just to put it in perspective, the focus has been on conversion of insanitary toilets — dry latrines — to sanitary ones. and work has been going on on for the last three years and the reports we have received from the states are that this conversion

2018-10-17,andhra pradesh hamlets shine in rural survey,"kuligod in karnataka’s belagavi district is the country’s best developed village, but more than a third of the gram panchayats ranked in the top 10 are in andhra pradesh, according to the findings of an ongoing rural development ministry survey., with multiple panchayats assigned the same score – and thus tied at the same ranking – there are 97 panchayats in the top 10 ranks. of these, 37 panchayats are in andhra pradesh while 24 are in tamil nadu. , villages from other states are represented only in single digits. of the states going to the polls next month, telengana and madhya pradesh have five and four panchayats in the top 10 ranks respectively., the rural development ministry has done a gap analysis of more than 3.5 lakh villages, in more than 1.6 lakh panchayats under the mission antyodaya convergence scheme. a team of officials surveyed and scored village level facilities and amenities using parameters related to infrastructure, economic development and livelihood, irrigation facilities, health, nutrition and sanitation, women’s empowerment, and financial inclusion., while in october 2017, an initial baseline survey was carried out in 50,000 gram panchayats, this year, the exercise is expected to cover all of the country’s 2.5 lakh panchayats by the end of november. the rankings will be updated as more panchayats are included, the ministry said., at the national level, the data shows progress in some areas and also spotlights discrepancies in respect of targets met under some other government schemes., for example, the survey reveals that more than 95% of villages have electricity available for domestic use, while the government had earlier this year claimed that 100% of villages had power connections., similarly with regard to sanitation, the survey shows only 58% of villages — slightly more than 2 lakh of the 3.5 lakh surveyed villages — are open defecation free (odf). however, according to the swachh bharat abhiyan-gramin, 5.13 lakh of india’s 6 lakh villages are already odf., the survey also shows only 21% of villages having a community waste disposal system. , about a quarter of all villages have more than 75% of households using clean energy, such as lpg or biogas., the survey indicates moderate progress in the rural housing scheme: less than 10% of the villages have more than 80% of their houses with kachha walls and roofs, indicating temporary structures. more than 73% of the villages are connected with an all-weather road., financial inclusion still has some way to go, with less than 15% of villages having banks, while just more than 10% have atms. while more than 26% of villages have post office facilities, only 8% have a soil testing centre and
