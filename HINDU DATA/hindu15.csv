2010-07-06,"food security — of apl, bpl & ipl","caption : for daily : tirunelveli : july : 11/07/2007 : a boy about get rice during the mambazha sangam held at palayamkottai on wednesday. photo: a_shaikmohideen - caption : for daily : tirunelveli : july : 11/07/2007 : a boy about get rice during the mambazha sangam held at palayamkottai on wednesday. photo: a_shaikmohideen | photo credit: a_shaikmohideen - a_shaikmohideen , there was irony in the timing of the petrol price decontrol order. the decision, which also covered major hikes in diesel and kerosene prices, and affects hundreds of millions of people, came even as manmohan singh advised world leaders in toronto on the need for “inclusive growth.” and while we are still debating “food security” and how best that should be achieved in law. it came while food price inflation edges towards 17 per cent and general inflation is in double digits. who are we trying to “include” in that growth?, no less tragic was the media's reaction to the price decontrol. even as cabinet ministers sought to distance themselves from it, the editorials mostly reeked of triumphalism: “free at last,” screamed one. “a bold, welcome move,” shrilled another headline. with rare exceptions, the edits — in contrast to the response of millions to monday's bandh — showed yet again how far the mass media are from mass reality., most of the time, as the late murray kempton used to say, the job editorial writers do, is to “come down from the hills after the battle is over and shoot the wounded.” the media have done that definition proud. there's even been an editorial on bhopal in the same month that didn't wait for that battle to be over. it finds the villains of bhopal to be the “activist industry that continues to milk the tragedy.” and mourns the real tragedy: that “any corporation, across the world, would be forced to think twice before proudly announcing to its shareholders that it has set up an ancillary unit in bhopal.” it does not once mention the words “union carbide.” roll over kempton. the shooting's on., the early protests against the price rise got short shrift in the media. in the largest english daily, it earned a couple of stories spanning a modest few inches across three or four columns. the same daily twice devoted a full page — without an ad — on successive days to the death by suicide of a fashion model in mumbai. also, passing off without much comment this week — the elevation of our food and agriculture minister to the post of president of the international cricket council. at a time when the entire nation is focussed on the issue of food prices and food security., mr. pawar is quoted as saying (afp, new delhi, july 2) that he would request the prime minister to lessen his ministerial workload. “i may suggest having more hands to help me. i had asked for three ministers but they have given me only one,” he told journalists. “... if i request to reduce some of my work, we may find some solution.” however, he does promise us that “i won't allow my work in the government to suffer.” that's reassuring. maybe it's time for the prime minister to extend inclusive growth to bring the food and agriculture minister into food and agriculture. (or we could include cricket in that sector.) four ministers in the same field would be truly inclusive., yet the fuel price decontrol will profoundly affect the prices of just about everything. at a time of already spiralling food costs. punctuated by periodic claims that “it should come down within a couple of months,” from ministers and upa hacks., now comes the news that the food security bill may be set for a radical overhaul. i guess that is welcome — it can't be worse than the early attempts at drafting one. take for instance the meeting of the empowered group of ministers held in february. they were to “discuss the enactment of the proposed national food security bill.” the first thing the egom came up with was this gem. 2.1 (a) “the definition of food security should be limited to the specific issue of foodgrains (wheat and rice) and be delinked from the larger issue of nutritional security.”, food security delinked from nutritional security? note that the same line concedes nutritional security is “the larger issue.” why then the need to delink the two?, is 35 kg of rice at rs. 3 a kilo (for a section of the population) food security? are there no other determinants of food security? like health, nutrition, livelihoods, jobs, food prices? can we even delink the fuel price hike from discussions on food security? or from the wilful gutting of the public distribution system? or from the havoc wrought by the ever-growing futures trade in wheat, pulses, edible oils and more?, the truth is the government seeks ways to spend less and less on the very food security it talks about. hunger is defined not by how many people suffer it, but by how many the government is willing to pay for. hence the endless search for a lower bpl figure. to the government's great dismay, all three officially-constituted committees have turned up estimates of poverty higher than its own. even the tendulkar committee, closest to the ruling elite's worldview, raises the estimate of rural poverty to 42 per cent. (on a weak and fragile basis, it is true. but still higher than the government's count.), the bpl expert group headed by n.c. saxena raises that to around 50 per cent. while the report of the national commission for enterprises in the unorganised sector states on its first page that 836 million indians (77 per cent of our people) live on rs. 20 a day or less. accepting that, for instance, would mean a few thousand crores more in spending on the hungry. the official line is simple. since we cannot afford to feed all the hungry, there must only be as many hungry as we can afford to feed., most dishonest of all is the “there-is-no-money” line. the country spends rs. 10,000 crore on a new airport. there's rs. 40,000 crore or more for the commonwealth games. there's rs. 60,000 crore happily lost in the spectrum scam. there's rs. 500,000 crore in write-offs under just three heads for the super-rich and the corporate sector in the current union budget. but funds for the hungry are hard to come by. what would it cost to universalise the pds? pravin jha and nilachal acharya estimate that if rice/wheat were made available to all indians at rs. 3 a kilo, it would add rs.84,399 crore to the food subsidy in coming budgets. that's about one-sixth of the tax write-offs for the wealthy in this year's budget. (other estimates place the added expenditure each year at no more than rs. 45,000 crore)., what will be the costs of not finding the money — in a country which ranks at 66 among 88 in the global hunger index? in a nation whose child malnourishment record is worse than that of sub-saharan africa? a country now ranking 134 in the united nations human development index below bhutan and laos?, the same country that has 49 dollar billionaires in the forbes list. (many of whom receive government freebies in diverse forms. some for their ipl involvements). if a government will not even try to ensure that no citizen goes hungry, should it remain in power? or should it, at the very least, state honestly that the food security of every indian is neither its aim nor its intent? why tag ‘food security' to a bill that will legitimise the opposite? how can we call something a ‘right' if everyone does not have it?, a disclosure: i was a member of the bpl expert group. in a note annexed to that report, i argued that in four sectors — food, healthcare, education and decent work — access had to be universal. that flows from the directive principles of state policy of the constitution. the rights of our people are based on their being citizens. not on their ability to pay. not on their being bpl or apl (or even ipl). rights, by definition, are universal and indivisible.",0.12856203477490605,"food security — apl , bpl &amp; ipl","caption : daily : tirunelveli : july : 11/07/2007 : boy get rice mambazha sangam held palayamkottai wednesday. photo : a_shaikmohideen - caption : daily : tirunelveli : july : 11/07/2007 : boy get rice mambazha sangam held palayamkottai wednesday. photo : a_shaikmohideen &#124; photo credit : a_shaikmohideen - a_shaikmohideen , irony timing petrol price decontrol order. decision , also covered major hikes diesel kerosene prices , affects hundreds millions people , came even manmohan singh advised world leaders toronto need “inclusive growth. ” still debating “food security ” best achieved law. came food price inflation edges towards 17 per cent general inflation double digits. trying “include ” growth? , less tragic media ' reaction price decontrol. even cabinet ministers sought distance , editorials mostly reeked triumphalism : “free last , ” screamed one. “a bold , welcome move , ” shrilled another headline. rare exceptions , edits — contrast response millions monday ' bandh — showed yet far mass media mass reality. , time , late murray kempton used say , job editorial writers , “come hills battle shoot wounded. ” media done definition proud.

2010-11-21,manmohan's defence,"this refers to the report “congress rallies behind manmohan” (nov. 20). it is not uncommon for a ruling party to rally behind the prime minister when he faces a crisis situation. it is expected to shield its leader when an allegation is levelled against him. but it is unfortunate that the new telecom minister, kapil sibal, chose to describe janata party leader subramanian swamy's attempt to get answers in the 2g spectrum scam as looking for political space. if dr. swamy's act is purely political, why did the supreme court direct that an affidavit be filed on behalf of dr. singh explaining his alleged inaction and silence for 16 months?, everyone knows that dr. singh, whose integrity is beyond doubt, does not have control over the upa government. the alliance has caused the congress an avoidable embarrassment and left the prime minister helpless., s. radhakrishnan,, chennai, the centre's move to replace solicitor-general gopal subramaniam with attorney-general g.e. vahanvati to appear in the case filed by dr. swamy is surprising. replacing the legal team is certainly not the way forward., ashok jayaram,, bangalore, none can beat the congress in damage control exercises. replacing the solicitor-general with the attorney-general to defend the prime minister in the supreme court, and making mr. sibal counter dr. swamy's accusations of inaction on the part of dr. singh, are amusing, to say the least. the congress is desperate to save the prime minister from a situation in which he finds himself by his own action, rather inaction., t.k. nagarajan,, bangalore, mr. sibal's remark that the prime minister would have been justified had he thrown dr. swamy's letters in the wastepaper basket is in bad taste. every citizen has a right to question the government for its actions and alleged misuse of resources. in india, it seems to have become a habit for the so-called netas to rule according to their whims, with nobody questioning them. misuse of public money has become routine. the common man surely has a right to know the facts., k.v.l. shanta,, singapore, it needs no great intelligence to guess the reasons for dr. singh's alleged inaction on the spectrum issue. coalition politics has landed the unimpeachable dr. singh in a soup. even now, when the scam is rocking the country, there are efforts to smoothen the dmk's ruffled feathers. mr. sibal's defence of the prime minister is unconvincing., a.v. reddi sastri,, srikakulam, the number of skeletons tumbling out of the cupboards of political parties is becoming too numerous to count. amid all this, dr. singh maintains a stony silence, seeing no evil, hearing no evil and speaking no evil. the prime minister cannot be so naive as not to have known the consequences of the scam. coalition compulsions made him look the other way., r. vasudevan,, chennai, no one, including members of the opposition, is likely to doubt dr. singh's personal incorruptibility. nor does anyone question his contributions to the nation in the last two decades and more. but he and the congress err in underestimating the nation's outrage over what is, at the least, a mismanagement resulting in (presumptive but not any the less real) huge losses to the exchequer. dr. singh would do well to be sensitive to this, instead of concentrating only on defending himself., a. ramachandran,, kochi, the rough and tumble of indian politics needs a seasoned, street-savvy prime minister who should be deft enough to know the pressure points of his ministers and

2010-12-05,netspeak: new frontiers of information retrieval,"this edition of netspeak takes a quick look at some of the new entrants in the realm of information retrieval, a highly explosive segment of cyberspace., qwiki, whenever we come across an unfamiliar theme or topic or historical event or something similar, the common recourse is an encyclopaedia., however, the current encyclopaedia content has one serious shortcoming, that is its text-based content. generally, the potential of the current graphics/multi-media technology is not exploited that much. there cannot be any dispute on the significance of presenting content using audio/video tools., for instance, while describing how kidney functions, instead of simply explaining the process using just text content, if we can present the video clipping of the internals of kidney and other organs with necessary voice-over, it would help the user internalise the concept faster. the new service qwiki (>http://www.qwiki.com/) seems to be a product serving this need rather elegantly., the main distinction of qwiki when compared with other information retrieval tools is its lively interactive experience. for instance, if you seek for information about a reasonably known personality, it will provide you a brief bio-sketch of that person with a balanced mix of text, image and video content with voice-over., similarly this service could come in handy in gauging the main attractions of a prospective place of visit. in response to your query, the system culls information -- text, image video etc -- pertaining to the subject and generates a qwiki on the fly. the service offers content on a variety of topics -- people, subjects, historical events and cities. though the service is in just alpha, you will be surprised at the kind of content that comes from it., duckduckgo, despite the existence of popular search engines, several new alternatives emerge regularly (of course, many of them slide into the oblivion too). one such alternative search engine, gaining popularity (especially among the savvy net crowd), is duckduckgo., in response to a query, search engines like google simply display the pages that contain the keyword. however, while delivering search results these search services generally do not consider the varied connotation of the word., for instance, if you enter the word ‘virus' you may find web pages discussing both computer viruses and clinical viruses. of course, for a person seeking information on computer viruses, this could present many frustrating moments., one solution to avoid such frustrations is to be more careful while entering the keyword (for instance, here enter ‘computer-virus' instead of just virus). but this may not be feasible always as the user may not be aware of all the possible connotations of the word/phrase., ideal solution to such word-ambiguities is to make the search engine force the user to correct the word before embarking on the search process. perhaps it can warn the user about the different meanings of the word and offer the user a range of alternatives., such a search service is no more a wishful thinking! duckduckgo (>http://duckduckgo.com/), the fast growing search service, does this pretty well. for instance, if you type the word, ‘iceberg', before starting the search it offers you different meanings of ‘iceberg' in different contexts. from the displayed alternatives, you can choose the one that suits your need. of course, this is just one of the many advantages of this simple but innovative search engine., spam-free and reasonably meaningful links in the search output is an important aspect of this service., besides offering appropriate results in a clean, easy-to-read, uncluttered interface, the service helps to navigate the output effortlessly., as soon as one reaches the end of the first set of results, the service automatically loads the next set — no ‘next' button clicking and all that., another notable aspect of this service is its ‘!bang‘ option that enables focussed searches with ease. for instance, if you wish to narrow your search to twitter database, invoke the search with the prefix ‘!twitter' (like ‘!twitter spectrum scam'). twitter aside, duckduckgo's ‘!bang' feature lets you search hundreds of other sites directly (>http://duckduckgo.com/bang.html)., yet another awesome feature of the service is the facility called ‘zero-click info'., with each search, just above the results, the service presents an answer box (zero-click info) that contains some explanation/description/information (culled from genuine sources like wikipedia) on the subject or theme being queried., instead of searching all over the web, search within topic-specific sites may yield better search output. blekko (>http://blekko.com/) is one such service worth a look in this context., besides offering several built-in topic-specific site lists (called ‘slashtags'), blekko lets you create own lists too. to search on a specific list (say ‘science'), just add the relevant ‘slashtag' at the end of the keyword (example: global warming /science)., an on-line book on net fundamentals, net is fast becoming an essential ingredient of modern way of life. though you can access the web from the comfort of your home, web journey without caution could land you in deep trouble. a reasonably good knowledge on different web technologies would certainly help you navigate the web with lesser hiccups. this context makes the free on-line book “20 things i learned about browsers and the web” rather significant., this free book from ‘google chrome' team lucidly explains topics such as ‘what is internet', ‘cloud computing” “html/html5”, “browser cookies”, ‘ip address and dns” and so on. so, if you wish to be an informed netizen, jump over to: >http://www.20thingsilearned.com/., mdownloader",0.14290075857784193,netspeak : new frontiers information

2010-12-09,"tata hits out at bjp, rajeev chandrasekhar","the 2g scam on thursday triggered a corporate war with industrialist ratan tata hitting out at the policies of the bjp-led nda government, and rajya sabha mp rajeev chandrasekhar, who had alleged that the tatas were one of the biggest beneficiaries of the spectrum allocation., accusing certain gsm operators, represented by the cellular operators association of india, and journalists of trying to subvert policies to suit their interests, mr. tata said many of the flip-flops in the telecom policy occurred during the bjp regime., stating that the licence policy of 2008 helped to break the powerful cartel, mr. tata demanded that the 2g spectrum allocation since 2001, a period that included the bjp-led nda regime, be probed., reacting to an open letter by mr. chandrasekhar, a former president of coai and independent mp supported by the bjp-jd(s), mr. tata said the recent policy (2g spectrum allocation in 2008) broke the powerful cartel that had been holding back competition and delaying implementation of policies., it was in 2008 that tata's telecom arm, ttsl — a key player in cdma space — entered the gsm platform dominated by big names such as airtel and vodafone., rebutting the charges, mr. chandrasekhar, an erstwhile telecom entrepreneur, hit back, saying that mr. tata was trying to divert the issue — which is the gap between the group's claim on probity and conduct of its telecom venture ttsl., he alleged that the tata company was one of the biggest beneficiaries of spectrum policies, contrary to all its claims of fair play and transparency., amid the trading of charges between corporate executives and leading telecom players, the government on thursday announced setting up a one-man panel to look into the spectrum allocation procedures and policies followed between 2001 and 2009., the decision to set up the inquiry by the retired supreme court judge, shivraj patil, comes a day after the court asked the government to widen the ambit of the cbi probe into the 2g spectrum scam to cover the nda regime when the first come, first served policy was first introduced., mr. tata's charge that “many of the flip-flops in the telecom policy occurred during the bjp regime” drew sharp reaction from the party, which said the industrialist was “no judge” and his views would not be given much importance as he himself was a “beneficiary” of the upa's telecom policy., mr. tata alleged that the switchover from auction to revenue sharing system for telecom operators during the bjp regime could have caused a loss of rs. 50,000 crore going by the parameters adopted by government auditor, cag, in examining 2g spectrum allocation., on mr. chandrasekhar's allegation that group company tata teleservices (ttsl) was a beneficiary of an out-of-turn allocation of spectrum, mr. tata said the true position was that ttsl had not, “i repeat not” been advantaged in any way by a. raja or any previous minister., using mr. tata's statement, the congress attacked the bjp, saying it was shying from a debate on the 2g spectrum issue as its top leadership was involved in taking “wrong” decisions, when the nda was in power, which led to a loss of rs. 60,000 crore to the government., “is it not a fact that in july 1999 immediately after the kargil war the then prime minister, atal bihari vajpayee, took the communication portfolio from jagmohan and helped the telecom companies, which resulted in a loss of rs. 60,000 crore to the country,” congress spokesperson manish tewari asked., niira radia, who is in the eye of the storm over leaked taped conversations, was engaged by the tata group to counter a media campaign against it by an “unholy nexus” between certain corporates and journalists., as tatas did not enjoy any “captive” connection to counter such media campaign, the group chief, who had earlier gone to the supreme court seeking a probe into leakage of tapes containing his conversation with ms. radia and also a ban on further publication of the same, said that the radia-led vaishnavi was engaged to counter vested interests., tata's views came amid the uproar over ms. radia's alleged nexus with corporate, politicians and journalists and the ongoing litigation on the 2g spectrum allocation scam., countering mr. chandrasekhar's charges levelled

2011-01-06,dealing with the 2g spectrum scam,"in this december 24, 2010 file photo, former telecom minister a. raja leaves the cbi headquarters after his interrogation in connection with the 2g spectrum allocation scam, in new delhi. , on december 16, 2010, the supreme court (justices g.s. singhvi and asok kumar ganguly, ) ordered a comprehensive and thorough investigation by the central bureau of investigation and the enforcement directorate into what has become notorious as “the 2g scam.” the investigation, into spectrum allocation from 2001 to 2008, would be monitored by the judges., one is reminded of the jain hawala case (vineet narain vs uoi) in which the author was counsel for the petitioners and later designated as amicus curiae. in that case, the cbi chargeesheeted three central cabinet ministers and the then leader of the opposition in january 1996 leading to their resignation. in may 1996, the serving governors of kerala and uttar pradesh were forced to resign and were charged. the fallout of all these resignations was described by the bbc as “the biggest political earthquake to have hit independent india.” in the april 1996 elections, the congress was reduced to 130-odd seats in the lok sabha and was voted out of office. however, all the prosecutions failed and most of the accused were discharged by the trial courts before the final judgment was delivered on december 18, 1997. (1998) 1 scc 226)., the supreme court observed: “the recent experience in the field of prosecution is also discouraging. to emphasise this point, some reference has to be made to a large number of prosecutions launched as a result of monitoring by the court in this matter which have resulted in discharge of the accused at the threshold … these facts are sufficient to indicate that either the investigation or the prosecution or both were lacking” (page 264-265, para 50)., the 2g scam has an equally explosive potential and should not result in a similar denouement. it is instructive to revisit some of the principal shortcomings of the investigations and the lessons from the past., considerable effort was made in the jain hawala judgment (justices c.j. verma, bharucha and sen) to insulate the cbi and the chief vigilance commissioner from political influence and make them autonomous. but the guidelines and directions given have been circumvented and have failed to achieve that result., many cbi officers, past and serving, are handicapped and cannot act independently and fearlessly, being subordinate to the political executive and bureaucrats — the same set of persons who are suspects., where powerful persons are involved, the cbi's track record is abysmal and hopeless. justice santosh hegde in the cpil vs . uoi: (2000) 8 scc 606, 625 = panna-mukta case observed that the cbi had resorted to ‘suggestio falsi' and ‘suppressio veri' and noted that files were destroyed unauthorisedly with an ulterior motive by its officers., an equally trenchant criticism came in the taj corridor scam case ((2007) 1 scc 110 at 133), in which justice kapadia observed: “we reject the status report dated 31-12-2004 as it is a charade of the performance of duty by cbi” (para 33)., “in matters after matters, we find that the efficacy and ethics of the governmental authorities are progressively coming under challenge before this court by way of pil for failure to perform their statutory duties. if this continues, a day might come when the rule of law will stand reduced to ‘a rope of sand'” (para 35)., the cbi's track record in the jain hawala case: the cbi's record in the jain hawala case was equally disappointing. sanjay kapoor's first story in the blitz on august 10, 1991 under the caption “top politicos in multi-crore hawala scandal” evoked no reaction from the investigating agencies. however, while investigating terrorist funding, the cbi on may 3, 1991 carried out simultaneous raids and searches all over india. accidentally, diaries and documents were seized from the jains, in addition to substantial cash and foreign exchange. the diaries contained hawala entries of payment in foreign exchange made abroad and equivalent rupee payments made in india to prominent and powerful politicians, bureaucrats and businessmen easily identifiable by the initials mentioned. the diaries were a ticking time bomb which could suddenly explode and had to be covered up. the cover-up was commenced by suspending the dig-cbi in-charge, on the allegation that he was asking for a bribe — a trap laid by the cbi with the cooperation of the jains who, ironically, instead of being the accused, became star witnesses. the unintended and unforeseen result was that the incriminating diaries were preserved. the time bomb was only temporarily defused., the jains were not even interrogated till the supreme court intervened on a pil petition filed by vineet narain, rajinder puri, kamini jaiswal and prashant bhushan. the authenticity of the diaries was confirmed by the cbi after the resourceful journalist vineet narain presented their photocopies., the version of b.r. lall, former joint director, cbi, on how the jain hawala case was scuttled by vijaya ramo rao (then director, cbi) is detailed in his book, who owns cbi — the naked truth., in sum, the investigations were derailed till the court proceedings. secondly, defective charge sheets were filed leading to the accused being discharged. thirdly, the enforcement directorate and income tax were kept out of the picture from 1991 to about 1995, disabling them from recording statements which are admissible in evidence under fera and income tax unlike those recorded by the police. the entire political establishment (ruling and opposition) closed ranks to save itself., in the skipper construction cases, the supreme court, through a series of orders and with a continuous “hands-on” approach by justice jeevan reddy, forced the investigating agencies to achieve substantial success. some innovative approaches in those cases are worth recalling. if, prima facie, there was a case of bribe or loss caused by public officials by breach of the fiduciary duty or violation of law, the court attached the properties of the suspects, their spouses and dependants. ((1996) 1 scc 272; (1996) 4 scc 622, (1997 (1) scale 532)., the 2g scam case may acquire contours similar to the jain hawala case as very powerful industrial and banking lobbies will exert influence to undermine the investigations., but in contrast, there are powerful elements in favour of unravelling the truth. the supreme court has adopted a “no-nonsense” approach; the cag report cannot be wished away; the opposition is in full cry; the electronic and print media are doing a commendable job — and it is the unremitting pressure and the continuing debate in the media that can tilt the balance and become decisive factors., the media, however, have their faults and excesses. to recall the famous words of chief justice hughes of the u.s. supreme court: “some degree of abuse is inseparable from the proper use of everything, and in no instance is this more true than in that of the press … it is better to leave a few of its noxious branches to their luxuriant growth, than, by pruning them away, to injure the vigour of those yielding the proper fruits. “, the media as a professional group have an inbuilt self-corrective mechanism promoted by the pressure of competition and the lure of improved ratings and readership. this hydraulic pressure is a self-cleanser and works aggressively even against media icons., first, the innovative steps in the skipper cases of attachment of properties for suspected bribes or breach of duty can be a potent judicial tool. secondly, a key input would be to fashion a leak-proof mechanism (independent of the government and investigating agencies) to collect evidence from ‘whistleblowers' and potential insider ‘approvers' with the assistance of former police officers, cvcs, cecs and others with impeccable integrity., thirdly, the money trail through the money laundering, fema and income tax routes — where statements recorded during investigations are admissible — should be traced., our respected prime minister in his new year message has promised to double efforts to make a “course correction” and cleanse our “governing processes” (the hindu, january 1, 2011)., a long-term solution and course correction to reduce corruption will require parliamentary intervention by setting up an independent commission against corruption (icac) with a distinct cadre of investigative officials and with an autonomous status and constitutional protection equivalent to the higher judiciary, the cag and the cec. a director of public prosecution with similar status and protection must also be appointed. other measures would merely be a charade.",0.08645751535286418,dealing 2g spectrum scam,"december 24 , 2010 file photo , former telecom minister a. raja leaves cbi headquarters interrogation connection 2g spectrum allocation scam , new delhi. , december 16 , 2010 , supreme court ( justices g.s. singhvi asok kumar ganguly , ) ordered comprehensive thorough investigation central bureau investigation enforcement directorate become notorious “the 2g scam. ” investigation , spectrum allocation 2001 2008 , would monitored judges. , one reminded jain hawala case ( vineet narain vs uoi ) author counsel petitioners later designated amicus curiae. case , cbi chargeesheeted three central cabinet ministers leader opposition january 1996 leading resignation. may 1996 , serving governors kerala uttar pradesh forced resign charged. fallout resignations described bbc “the biggest political earthquake hit independent india. ” april 1996 elections , congress reduced 130-odd seats lok sabha voted office. however , prosecutions failed accused discharged trial courts final judgment delivered december 18 , 1997.

2011-01-12,"sorry people, we're hanging up on you","new delhi, 07/01/2011: union minister of communications and information technology, kapil sibal addressing a press conference on telecom issues including 2g spectrum in new delhi on friday, 07, january, 2011. photo: s_subramanium | photo credit: s_subramanium , “milord,” cunning lawyers have argued in countless hindi movies, “how can there have been a murder when there is no dead body?” i was reminded of this line when i heard kapil sibal — who has been performing as an understudy at the ministry of communications and information technology ever since a. raja was ousted on corruption charges — bravely defending the legacy of his predecessor at a press conference. by attacking the comptroller and auditor general's 2g spectrum scam report and claiming the government lost no revenue despite the fact that “procedural irregularities in the implementation of the first-come first-served policy” may have occurred, mr. sibal has done the political equivalent of removing the “dead body” from the crime scene and then declaring his clients innocent. for if the government lost no money through the sale of spectrum in 2008, it stands to reason that the politicians, bureaucrats and businessmen who are today being investigated could not have made any money either. illegitimate profits cannot be conjured out of thin air — which is what spectrum essentially is. there is no dead body milord., sadly for prime minister manmohan singh and congress president sonia gandhi, who no doubt prepped mr. sibal to make his ill-advised arguments, the cag report is full of incriminating corpses. and their ghosts are likely to stick around long enough to haunt the ruling party at the time of the next general election., the central thrust of mr. sibal's argument is that the pac used flawed logic to arrive at the conclusion that the sale of universal access service licenses by the department of telecom in 2008 led to a revenue loss of rs.1,76,000 crore. but here's what he chose not to say. the cag itself acknowledged in its concluding chapter that the amount of loss could be debated but “the fact that there has been loss to the national exchequer in the allocation of 2g spectrum cannot be denied.”, indeed, the cag made separate calculations based on four different methodologies in order to demonstrate the flawed nature of the licensing system the dot ran. the figure cited by mr. sibal came from using the 3g spectrum auction proceeds as a guide to the revenue the government gave up by not auctioning 2g spectrum. other methods used were looking at the sale of equity by shell-company licensees swan telecom and unitech. both of these companies sold a chunk of their otherwise worthless equity to established operators, thereby providing a helpful indication of what the licenses they had bought for a song were truly worth. extrapolating from those sales figures, the cag estimated that the government short-changed itself by anywhere from rs.57,666 crore to rs.69,626 crore., the cag report methodically establishes how the great spectrum robbery of 2008 was essentially a scam within a scam. the original scam was designed to benefit the universe of existing and potential telecom operators by selling them a scarce resource — spectrum — on a first come, first served (fcfs) basis at a seven-year-old price that had no bearing on current market conditions. given the exponential increase in teledensity between 2001 and 2008 — by some estimates, the number of mobile subscribers had already risen from four million to 300 million and was expected to continue to grow at a rapid clip — the failure to use an efficient price discovery mechanism meant the government was prepared to forsake an enormous amount of revenue in order to benefit operators fortunate enough to get hold of new spectrum., but having scripted super profits for the lucky telecom companies in the spectrum allocation process, it was inevitable that the politicians and bureaucrats running the show would take the next step. the only way to accumulate rent from companies benefiting from a giveaway that is available to all as a matter of policy is to use one's allocative power to favour some over others. this was the genesis of the second scam in which a handful of applicants — many of whom were completely unqualified to be applying for telecom licenses at all — were cherry-picked by the dot in an arbitrary subversion of the first come, first served process. the cag report demonstrates how swan, in which the anil dhirubhai ambani group had a key stake, and unitech were among the beneficiaries of this. bank drafts and guarantees were prepared in advance by some companies who were unofficially tipped off so that their completed applications for spectrum could be submitted literally within minutes and hours of the official call going out., mr. sibal, who tore into the cag, was sporting enough to admit there may have been some wrongdoing in the manner in which the fcfs policy was implemented. at the same time, he insisted the policy of charging 2001 prices was correct and that a 2g spectrum auction would have led to an increase in the price of telecom services. what he ignores is the fact that the cost of telecom services emerging from the 2g allocation will be a function not of the absurdly low price at which the government sold spectrum but of the prevailing tariff rate in the market and also the higher resale price at which this precious commodity finally enters the system. to paraphrase an argument first made by sunil jain in the financial express last year, there was indeed an auction for 2g spectrum whether mr. sibal approves of auctioning or not. but this auction was conducted not by the government, as it should have been, but by the companies who benefited from the arbitrary manner in which spectrum ended up getting allocated. they simply turned around and resold what they had received to the highest bidder., mr. sibal also sought to argue that the government policy on spectrum allocation — of underpricing it or even giving it away free — was justified in the name of keeping the cost of basic telephony down. he compared the rs.17 a minute cost of a mobile phone call a decade back with the 30 paise per minute rate today to prove his point but this is a flawed argument. most technology-driven consumer goods and services experience a declining price curve over time. i paid $1,000 as a graduate student in new york for my first laptop computer in 1990. it was a no-brand, 386 chip, 40mb hard drive heavyweight monster whose battery lasted about an hour if i was lucky. today, $1,000 will buy you a powerful notebook and decent variants can be bought for as little as $300. it also cost me $2 a minute to call my parents back home (which is why i rarely did so). the last time i was in the u.s., i could call india for eight cents a minute. the drop in call rates has nothing to do with subsidised spectrum as mr. sibal would have us believe, but with competition, increases in productivity and the global ebb and flow of technological change and obsolescence which allowed indian companies to buy 2g network equipment at a relatively inexpensive cost. in any case, even at the supposedly low call rates in india, telecom operators are making serious money. the last thing they need is a free handout in the form of an fcfs spectrum allocation policy, that too one which is rigged., the government's argument about keeping mobile call rates low may have had some credibility if the logic was applied consistently. but everything in india is contingent on whose asset is being sold to whom. when a public asset like spectrum is to be sold to a private company like anil ambani's swan telecom, or to tata or others, we are told the price must be kept low even if there is a revenue loss. when a public asset like food grain is to be sold to the poor under the proposed right to food act, the same people say prices cannot be kept low because this would lead to a revenue loss. when a public resource like krishna-godavari (kg) gas comes into the hands of an industrialist like mukesh ambani, the price must be kept high even if this means consumers end up paying a higher price for electricity and fertilizers. from 2g to kg to cwg the system's logic and rules will always be designed to allow maximum profits for those with real connections.",0.06444228701581642,"sorry people , ' hanging","new delhi , 07/01/2011 : union

2011-02-15,optimism on speedy 2g spectrum scam trial,"r. k. raghavan: ‘my vision is that the cbi should be as powerful and esteemed as the federal bureau of investigation’. photo: r.v.moorthy | photo credit: r_v_moorthy , r.k. raghavan, the distinguished former director of the central bureau of investigation (cbi), spoke to j. venkatesan in the context of the supreme court asking the central government to set up a special court to try the 2g spectrum scam case. in the hour-long interview done in new delhi on february 13, he also spoke on a range of issues including the future of the cbi, and the need to strengthen it by means of a special enactment and insulate it from political influence. excerpts:, the supreme court is monitoring the cbi investigation into the mammoth 2g spectrum scam. how far do you think the probe will go? will it meet the same fate as those announced earlier into other big scams?, i'm quite confident that the investigation will be taken to its logical conclusion with several charge sheets being filed against many individuals. i'm equally sanguine about a speedy trial. the supreme court may even fix a deadline for its conclusion. it could possibly direct a day-to-day trial., can the cbi go beyond the conspiracy angle and take action against the beneficiaries of the 2g scam? do you think a separate court could bring quick justice in this case?, it would be ridiculous if the beneficiaries are not proceeded against. the cbi will undoubtedly do this within the framework of the law., do you think the supreme court should constitute a committee to monitor a further probe, as you have suggested?, i strongly endorse this. since this is a massive investigation, a committee, headed by a former supreme court judge or former high court judge, a reputed lawyer who is knowledgeable in criminal matters, and a former cbi officer, perhaps of the rank of inspector general of police, may be of great assistance to the court. it should be able to report to the supreme court from time to time on the details of the progress in the investigation., do you think the supreme court should confine itself to monitoring the investigation, or can it go further, taking steps such as vetting the charge sheet? will the supreme court approving the charge sheet affect the rights of the accused to claim discharge from the case?, this is a matter for debate. going by the importance of the matter, nothing can be left to chance. vetting of the charge sheet can be done by the committee that i have suggested. this will ensure that there are no gaps. this procedure will not in any way prejudice a fair trial; the accused will have every opportunity to defend themselves., the supreme court is now seized of the matter of the appointment of the central vigilance commissioner (cvc). do you feel that the process of the cbi director's appointment should be similar to that for the cvc's appointment?, i strongly believe that the cbi director's appointment should also be done by a committee comprising the prime minister, the union home minister and the leader of the opposition. of course, it should be by consensus. none will have a veto power. the current procedure makes the director feels obliged to the ruling party or coalition, even though he is generally chosen on the basis of seniority and merit and he enjoys a fixed tenure of a minimum of two years. this is a step that would further strengthen his independence from the executive., should the cbi be vested with more powers, free from political influence?, insularity from political pressure is an absolute must. at present such insularity does not exist. the single directive as spelt out by the supreme court in vineet narain that requires government approval for even a preliminary enquiry against officers of and above the rank of joint secretary, considerably whittles down the director's authority. worse is the dependence on the government for preferring an appeal against acquittals. the provision in the code of criminal procedure in this regard, which vests authority on the government whether or not to appeal needs to be deleted so that the director becomes the sole authority in the matter. at present, this authority is perceived as being misused by governments., what is the future of the cbi and its role in combating corruption and other crimes?, it is not all that well-known that the cbi suffers from a serious resources crunch. it has about 4,000 officers and carries a large number of vacancies at any point of time., the actual number of investigating officers works out to about 1,000. they are required to handle the 1,000 and odd new cases registered every year and also tackle the huge number of pending cases. how do you expect speedy investigation in such a situation? also, promotion opportunities for directly-recruited officers of the cbi are far too limited, leading to a severe morale problem. if the cbi is treated like any other government department, we will be stuck with an inefficient machinery, that too at a time when corruption in public services is nearly at its peak., more than anything else, the cbi needs statutory recognition. it survives on an executive order and derives powers from an antiquated delhi special police establishment act. several draft bills for a cbi act prepared at different points of time are pending with the government. but there is no political will to bring a draft bill before parliament. this is because no political party would like to see a strong cbi that does not depend on the mercies of the executive. as in the case of corruption, this indifference cuts across party lines. and no party is a saint as far as the misuse of the cbi is concerned., if the organisation enjoys relative independence, we must thank the former chief justice of india, j.s. verma, for his judgment in the hawala case (1997) wherein he laid down a procedure for the appointment of a director and gave a mandatory tenure of two years. i think this tenure is too short for a director to leave an impression of his abilities. remember, the director of the federal bureau of investigation (fbi) in the united states enjoys a 10-year tenure so as to make it co-terminus with a u.s. president's two terms in office. it is the president who appoints the federal bureau of investigation director, of course after obtaining the senate's ratification., my vision is that the cbi should be as powerful and esteemed as the fbi. this is possible only if it receives a massive outlay in terms of manpower and technology. i want it to be on a par with the fbi in being able to investigate the most complicated cyber crimes, including any possible cyber attacks on the indian defence and information technology systems. at present it does not possess this capability., divesting the cbi of its authority to take up cases involving terrorism through a new national investigation agency (nia) is highly debatable. this is a poor reflection on the ability of india's premier investigating body. even if this step cannot be reversed, what is the harm in making the nia a wing of the cbi, so that the cbi director oversees its work? after all, you choose the seniormost and the most competent indian police service officer to head the cbi. why don't you use his talent to solve terrorist crimes? the argument that he does not have the time to take up this task is specious., what is your experience as the chief of the special investigation team (sit) in monitoring the gujarat riots cases? are you satisfied with the progress so far?, the sit, comprising officers from both gujarat and outside with a good track record of investigation, is an interesting experiment. it is a good tool through which courts can ensure objectivity and quality in controversial and complicated investigations. if it succeeds — there is no reason why it will not — it would provide the greatest assistance to all courts, including the supreme court, in future contingencies. for me personally, this has been a great learning process. my interaction with two great lawyers — harish salve and raju ramachandran — who are the amicus curiae appointed by the supreme court, has been a rewarding experience. they have done a great job in bringing the balance required in a contentious matter under probe. handling the non-governmental organisations here has required great skill and patience. i am the richer for this. more than all these, if i have survived these three years, it is solely because of the unfailing courtesy and understanding shown to me by the distinguished three-member bench of the supreme court. also relevant is the cooperation extended by the union home ministry and the state government., i must mention here that the supreme court directive on witness protection has been strictly enforced. wherever there was even a hint of a complaint, the sit has moved fast. this has ensured that the deposition of prosecution witnesses, especially victims, has been in an environment generally free from threat or inducement. i am satisfied with the progress made by the sit .one case, the main godhra case, is ready for pronouncing the judgment, slated for february 19. except for two other cases, concerning naroda gaon and naroda pathiya, in the rest of the six cases the trial is nearly over. my nine teams have done a great job, despite several odds., what are your comments on the cbi's handling of the aarushi-hemraj murder case, in which the court has issued summons to the dental surgeon couple?",0.13122870496004824,optimism speedy 2g spectrum scam trial,"r. k. raghavan : ‘my vision cbi powerful esteemed federal bureau investigation ’ . photo : r.v.moorthy &#124; photo credit : r_v_moorthy , r.k. raghavan , distinguished former director central bureau investigation ( cbi ) , spoke j. venkatesan context supreme court asking central government set special court try 2g spectrum scam case. hour-long interview done new delhi february 13 , also spoke range issues including future cbi , need strengthen means special enactment insulate political influence. excerpts : , supreme court monitoring cbi investigation mammoth 2g spectrum scam. far think probe go ?

2011-02-18,the indian revolution is within,"arriving at ‘the happening city,’ what does anand giridharadas find? drivers dressed in white, lining up the corridor leading out of the airport, holding signs for customers such as ‘microsoft mr sridhar’ and ‘m. rita singh motorola.’, sixty-three kinds of whisky for sale at this world-class airport in hyderabad, with toilets cleaned no longer using the traditional twig brooms but with vacuum cleaners; and security cameras monitoring whether the cleaners performed their tasks at the appointed times, he writes in ‘india calling: an intimate portrait of a nation’s remaking’ (harper). “what remained of old india was visible in the colourful folk art that had been etched into the glass walls of the terminal. but it was an india of dancing ladies in saris, simplified and packaged for the white man.”, force of the dreams, driving into the city, past ‘the rugged, boulder-strewn villages,’ it is ‘evidence of a new and sudden middle-class plenty’ that the author sees. “cellphones were hawked every few yards. english classes were on offer. recruiting agencies promised to carry the young out of india, to work as flight attendants and software coders and engineers. a place called istore sold ipods…”, the combined message of the ad signage in the city hinted at ‘the escalator of middle-class respectability that millions were riding,’ observes giridharadas. “first a cellphone, then a motorbike, then a car, then a laptop, then a house, then a wife.”, the deepest change that he witnessed in india was not in what its factories were building or what its programmers were coding, but it was in the mind, in how people conceived of their possibilities. the indian revolution was within, describes the author. “it was a revolution in private life, in the tenor of emotions and the nature of human relationships. the very fabric of indianness… was slowly, gently unravelling by the force of the dreams, and allowing itself to be woven in new ways.”, borrowed emotions, a chapter titled ‘ambition’ talks about the texting culture in umred, a town in maharashtra with a population of about 50,000. text messages brimmed with borrowed emotions – trite proverbs, made-up sayings, quotations from people they scarcely knew of, such as abraham lincoln, reports giridharadas., ninety per cent of the messages appeared to be forwards, as if the young had so much to say to each other, and no language of their own to say it, he notes. “a new day had dawned, and with it a new idea of human relationships, relationships not of hierarchical authority but of democratic amity. there had been no time for these new relationships to develop, and they had not yet gained their own vocabulary. there was so much raw energy but no context, nothing to guide it…”, as an onlooker of the exchange between ‘ravindra’ and ‘sunita’ – about whom you would read in the chapter – what the author records is that they had said more to each other through him or with their thumbs tapping tirelessly at their phones than they had ever dared to say in person. “‘you’re the kind of friend who is difficult to forget,’ she had once texted him. ‘i miss you very much here,’ he had replied.”, private space, a not-to-miss chapter is the one on ‘love,’ where giridharadas goes down ‘the class ladder’ to discover that the sexual revolution is more of a textual revolution. india is in the grip of a mobile phone craze, and for young middle-class indians what could not be attempted in person could now be pursued by phone, he narrates., “the cellphone gave the young a zone of individual identity, of private space, that they had never known. it gave those who did not have their own home, car, or bedroom a chance to have, at least, their own phone number and a collection of messages that no one else would read.” not surprisingly, the author comes across young people, well into their twenties, who still had not touched someone of the other sex, but had their phone in their pockets vibrating ‘all day long with textual innuendo, with flashes of a new kind of romance striving to establish itself.’, the case of ashish chetri (‘twenty-four, short, and pudgy, an assistant chef in a five-star hotel’) recounted in the book is one of a gradualist approach, with quests made mostly via cellphone in a middle-class world where ‘the women did not go to bars or date or go home with men. at most, they agreed to coffees, with coffee meaning just coffee – usually with another woman brought along as a chaperone.’, anonymous texting, ashish’s method, as he explains to the author, begins with taking note of women who interested him when he went out in large groups of friends and friends’ friends, and then obtaining the phone number of an intriguing woman through his friends. “he would text her anonymously for several days, perhaps beginning with a message like, ‘some guy around you likes you.’ if he received a positive reply, he would reveal his identity, raise the temperature of provocation, and press the woman to meet him in person.”, but before you try out the method, read on what happened when ashish fixed his gaze on a neighbour and sent her a message anonymously. “‘thank you for admiring me!’ she wrote back ‘but u know wat i feel dnt u think dat instead of sending me msges like a thief y dnt u come up n speak 2 me openly. i mean (face 2 face) dnt u think dat dis is a better idea? afterall v r not strangers v r neighbours m i not right? now the rest is upto u ashish.’”, part-time pursuit, returning to ‘the happening city,’ in the ‘anger’ chapter, you are introduced to venugopal, a maoist poet, irritated at ‘a new kind of dehumanisation: an obsession with advancement, the erosion of time, the turning of men into robots, and, above all, a fragmenting of the society – no longer into brahmins here and untouchables there, but into software engineers who lived in gated enclosures and villagers who were told to pack up and make way for a new airport for the software engineers.’, the contrast that venugopal presents to the author is one of a journalist in a financial daily – penning articles that gushed tributes to the new economy with headlines such as ‘small is what makes microsoft go,’ ‘ibm’s latest offers road to infinity,’ and ‘get ready to surf the net through your television’ – versus an opinion columnist in a telugu newspaper. “to earn a livelihood, i have to do something, because i’m not a whole-timer for revolution,” venugopal reasons. and, recounts giridharadas, “it was my first brush with the idea of part-time revolution…”, a book that is too difficult to ignore., **, tailpiece, “they found a strand of the spectrum scam stretching into space, and so…”, “they are giving up the probe?”, “no, a team is getting ready to go out there!”, **",0.10331923697995124,indian revolution within,"arriving ‘the happening city , ’ anand giridharadas find ?

2011-02-19,it's time to get down to business,"manmohan singh's second term has seen huge scams but also action against crony capitalism of a kind india has never experienced. , anyone trying to predict the outcome of our polity's life and death struggle with crony capitalism will have to make sense of two contradictory sets of images., on the one hand is the obfuscation and prevarication that senior ministers have served up when confronted with the reality of the 2g spectrum scam and other unprecedented instances of corporate and political robbery. the most recent display of this was by prime minister manmohan singh himself, who needlessly played down the scale and significance of the revenue loss that the 2g scam had caused. but, on the other, are the pace and scope of the current investigation, which has also been unrivalled by anything india has witnessed so far. the same prime minister whose silence and ambivalence on 2g was seen by the opposition and the public at large as weakness and even complicity has pushed the central bureau of investigation into summoning and questioning top industrialists like anil ambani, raiding kalaingar tv, the business arm of a key political ally, the dmk, and sending a. raja, who was telecom minister till some time ago, to the unwholesome confines of tihar jail., these are extraordinary developments by any yardstick and government managers have let it be known that there is further excitement in the offing. in the days and weeks ahead, more iconic businessmen are likely to be questioned for their involvement in the spectrum allocation scam. nor will shahid balva be the only high net worth individual to be packed off to judicial remand., when the leaked radia tapes exposed a small part of the inner workings of the india establishment, our crony capitalists banded together to plead privacy and complain loudly about a “witch hunt.” top corporate figures and even some politicians spoke about the danger of india becoming a “banana republic” and issued dark warnings in serial interviews about how the investment climate in the country was being adversely affected by the absurd suggestion that respectable businessmen might actually be involved in scams. the purpose of that fully scripted campaign was to ensure that the media, the investigating agencies and the courts all back off. fortunately for our body politic, that has not happened. public disaffection is so high that none of the estates of our system can afford to be seen as slackening. and that includes the executive too, notwithstanding the ‘zero loss' logic it foolishly put out. in his testimony to the public accounts committee of parliament, the cbi director was at pains to distance himself from that arithmetic of denial. though the agency was painfully slow in getting off the block, nobody can really fault its current approach. and the credit for that must be shared equally by the media, the courts but also, ironically, dr. singh., yes, the supreme court is monitoring the functioning of the cbi but there are scores of cases where similar monitoring has produced nothing even remotely so dramatic. the mulayam singh disproportionate assets case, for one. when you are in government service, individual acts of bravery without the requisite air cover can be risky. as the police officers who raided the offices of reliance industries in new delhi 13 years ago when atal bihari vajpayee was prime minister discovered, taking on the biggest captains of industry is not exactly a career advancing move. if today, the younger ambani is answering questions about his role in swan telecom, there should be no doubt in anyone's mind that the agency has received pretty direct encouragement from the highest levels of the government., the question, of course, is whether or not the cbi will persist in its endeavours. are we being treated to an elaborate dog-and-pony show? or does the agency's current activism represent a fundamental course correction for a system which has tolerated and thrived on corruption? if yes, does the prime minister have the political clout to see things through?, rent seeking and money making have been fellow travellers of the indian political system for more than four decades but this is arguably the first time that a minister has been run out of office and sent to jail as part of a criminal investigation. never before has the role of big business come under the scanner like this either. when the bharatiya janata party came to power at the centre in 1998, it promised clean governance. what the country got instead was sweetheart deals in the form of privatisation of hotels and other public sector assets, the petrol pump scam, the coffin scam and other crooked ventures. as the justice shivraj patil report has catalogued, the rot in telecom policy and spectrum allocation also started then. but nothing was ever probed., the united progressive alliance inherited this corrupt system and presided over its unprecedented expansion. thanks to whistleblowers, upright auditors, a vigilant media and a fair bit of corporate rivalry, however, the truth about 2g, the commonwealth games and other money-making enterprises has slowly come trickling out. there are, of course, scores of other fishy deals that need probing too, especially those involving land grants and mining concessions., what explains the schizophrenic attitude of the united progressive alliance government towards the 2g scam? why does the prime minister peddle the fiction that companies like swan or unitech did not resell their spectrum (for a profit) but only expanded their equity base, when the sale of equity for a company which has no assets other than spectrum amounts to the same thing? why does he persist in comparing the loot of public money via the sale of cheap spectrum to the cost of providing food subsidies for the poor — even as the cbi is pounding on the doors of the companies that benefited from the 2g allocation?",0.052519135453918064,' time get business,"manmohan singh ' second term seen huge scams also action crony capitalism kind india never experienced. , anyone trying predict outcome polity ' life death struggle crony capitalism make sense two contradictory sets images. , one hand obfuscation prevarication senior ministers served confronted reality 2g spectrum scam unprecedented instances corporate political robbery. recent display prime minister manmohan singh , needlessly played scale significance revenue loss 2g scam caused. , , pace scope current investigation , also unrivalled anything india witnessed far. prime minister whose silence ambivalence 2g seen opposition public large weakness even complicity pushed central bureau investigation summoning questioning top industrialists like anil ambani , raiding kalaingar tv , business arm key political ally , dmk , sending a. raja , telecom minister till time ago , unwholesome confines tihar jail. , extraordinary developments yardstick government managers let known excitement offing. days weeks ahead , iconic businessmen likely questioned involvement spectrum allocation scam. shahid balva high net worth individual packed judicial remand. , leaked radia tapes exposed small part inner workings india establishment , crony capitalists banded together plead privacy complain loudly “witch hunt. ” top corporate figures even politicians spoke danger india becoming “banana republic ” issued dark warnings serial interviews investment climate country adversely affected absurd suggestion respectable businessmen might actually involved scams. purpose fully scripted campaign ensure media , investigating agencies courts back off. fortunately body politic , happened. public disaffection high none estates system afford seen slackening. includes executive , notwithstanding ‘zero loss ' logic foolishly put out. testimony public accounts committee parliament , cbi director pains distance arithmetic denial. though agency painfully slow getting block , nobody really fault current approach. credit must shared equally media , courts also , ironically , dr. singh. , yes , supreme court monitoring functioning cbi scores cases similar monitoring produced nothing even remotely dramatic. mulayam singh disproportionate assets case , one. government service , individual acts bravery without requisite air cover risky. police officers raided offices reliance industries new delhi 13 years ago atal bihari vajpayee prime minister discovered , taking biggest captains industry exactly career advancing move. today , younger ambani answering questions role swan telecom , doubt anyone ' mind agency received pretty direct encouragement highest levels government. , question , course , whether cbi persist endeavours. treated elaborate dog-and-pony show ?

2011-03-04,lessons from the thomas verdict,"the supreme court's verdict pronounced on march 3 on the appointment of central vigilance commissioner p.j. thomas could not have come at a more appropriate time. each day seems to bring up a new scam, and this confirms that the nation's moral fibre is in tatters. unless this dangerous trend is reversed, india's future generations will become hostage to a situation where they cannot afford to be even minimally honest. india's current political leadership of all hues is unequal to the challenge. their focus is solely on grabbing votes with blatantly false promises and alluring freebies at the cost of the exchequer. only the judiciary is equipped and empowered to stem the rot, notwithstanding the fact that it has its own internal problems to solve., there are some uninformed sections that take umbrage at the supreme court ‘taking over' governance. this is an appallingly myopic view. had the judiciary not intervened as strongly and decisively as it did over the past few months, india would have become the laughing stock of the world. recent judicial rulings have enhanced the country's image and sent across the message that it means business in handling the scourge of corruption. today, the rest of the world is watching india admiringly and enviously for the way it is moving forward in creating knowledge and skills. the country will forfeit this enormous goodwill unless it comes down heavily on those who are robbing its national wealth without any fear whatsoever. the recent judicial decisions, however harsh they may seem, should serve, at least partly, to restore outsider-confidence in india's resilience and capacity to move ahead on the economic front., no proof is any longer required to show that the choice of mr. thomas was downright arbitrary, illegal and laughable. it was an exercise of executive authority that was questionable, whatever standards you apply. the supreme court's ruling leaves no one in doubt that fundamental facts that should have agitated the minds of those who are authorised by law (read the central vigilance commission act) to make such a vital appointment were glossed over for reasons of expediency. it is beyond comprehension why the high power committee (hpc) chose to wear blinkers. virtually anybody could have been appointed, except one facing a criminal trial. the clearance by the previous cvc that is touted in defence of mr. thomas is but a pro forma requirement that applies to less important jobs in government. it was certainly not applicable to an ‘integrity commission,' as the court has chosen to label the central vigilance commission., tale in the notings, the revelation that two members of the hpc were not convinced that the position required a 100 per cent corruption-free individual is, to say the least, sad and dismaying. the records speak for themselves, and the department of personnel and training (dopt) could not be faulted. its notings since the year 2000 had made it abundantly clear that mr. thomas in fact had a serious problem. this was ignored. mr. thomas took the stand in court that the fact that he had been made secretary to government was proof enough that he was untainted. but he was greeted the very next day with the arrest of the former telecommunications secretary, siddharth behura, by the central bureau of investigation in connection with the 2g spectrum scam. integrity is by no means the exclusive preserve of the higher echelons in society, and certainly not the bureaucracy., the magnitude of corruption in the higher levels of the civil services is actually enormous compared to that in the lower rungs. the arrest last week of the chairman of the national aluminium company and his wife, and the seizure of significant quantities of gold and cash, are testimony to the need for anti-corruption agencies to focus on senior levels of the officialdom with greater aggression. the cbi is doing an admirable job on this front, and it deserves much larger annual accretions in manpower and more incentives to its staff. their morale needs to be propped up substantially and meaningfully if the government is serious about tackling graft. in parliament, the opposition parties should concentrate on this agenda rather than seek to score brownie points over those in government who have grievously erred and lost their reputation for objectivity and clear thinking. this subject can do with a lot less of politics and more time-bound action, in order that everyone in high places would think twice before doing anything that is even remotely dishonest., debatable aspects, there are two aspects of the supreme court judgment of march 3 that are, however, debatable. the first is the direction that the pool for the choice of a cvc need not be confined to civil servants, and that it should be wider. will this give heavily politicised individuals who may otherwise be known for their personal integrity, the opportunity to infiltrate the institution? this issue remains in the realm of conjecture. given the proclivity among those in power or outside to look at every appointment through a political prism, i fear that the provision to appoint even a person who is not a civil servant to the office could become a mischievous tool in the hands of an unscrupulous executive. this direction to expand the zone of consideration will have to be read along with the supreme court's rejection of the plea to make the appointment on the basis of a consensus. indeed, giving the veto power to one member could stymie the process of selection, and this is not desirable. at the same time, the experience in the case of mr. thomas makes you wary of the possible designs of those in power to steamroll the process just to gain political mileage., recent events should convince the concerned citizen that maturity and magnanimity do not necessarily go with authority. this is why i would still plump for statutory recognition of the need for a consensus in making the appointment. this may seem preposterous, but is worth a trial. even if this process leads to several names being rejected and a consequent delay, ultimately the prime minister, the home minister and the leader of the opposition should be able to agree on one name. the cvc's job is not a fire-fighting assignment. even if the position remains vacant for several months because of a lack of consensus, the heavens will not fall before an acceptable candidate is found. and there are other members of the commission who can hold the fort till a chief is appointed. let us hasten slowly and arrive at a universally acceptable candidate, rather than be saddled with the wrong individual who is surrounded by controversies., the court judgment reinforces the widespread feeling that the judiciary is the last bastion of indian democracy. it must be guarded zealously and at all costs. let not petty minds be

2011-03-08,revenue loss,"this refers to the article “corporate socialism's 2g orgy” (march 7) that highlights the morass the country has sunk into. mr. p. sainath and the hindu must be complimented for digging out the hidden truth about the indian budget. such an example of in-depth analysis and a reading between the lines is what constitutes true journalism., the radia tapes, the original report of the pci sub-committee on paid news, the government's unwillingness to take action against hoarders of black money, the appointment of a cvc flouting regulations and now, the hidden, but largest conceivable, transfer of wealth and resources to the wealthy through the budget are pieces of a puzzle that are becoming clearer by the day. in the name of the poor, the country is being made to pay for the unhealthy political–corporate nexus. it also explains how high net-worth individuals and private companies are the primary drivers of illicit monetary flows out of india, as reported in the gfi report., v.j. nambiar,, jakarta, the article is another masterpiece of responsible journalism. that this mind-boggling amount of money is equivalent to the funds siphoned off from the country and illegally stashed away in foreign banks is a grim and frightening reminder of the reality., but mr. sainath is perhaps wrong in assuming that “even kapil sibal cannot defend the revenue losses as notional,” as mr. sibal can do it by saying that the methodology in computing these losses is wrong as was contended of the cag's calculations in the 2g scam., b. harish,, mangalore, the reported daily loss of rs.240 crore as corporate tax is perplexing. it is amazing how such a thing is being allowed by the finance ministry, especially when there are large advertisements in the mass media that ask the average citizen to pay a variety of taxes on time., we cannot afford such a loss as it can take care of so many fund-starved development projects and even avoid unnecessary taxation in various sectors. the opposition and concerned citizens should ensure that the government gets what is due., ganeshan,, bangalore, the hindu seems to be the only media outlet that has revealed the darkest aspect of budget 2011., rashmi jha,, new delhi, the article is a grim reminder of the insensitivity and lack of collective interest in the welfare of the common people. the amount of money forgone is evidence of this. when we see policies of different budgets over the years, it seems that the government is paying lip service to the aspirations of the people and has slashed ‘agriculture and allied activities' from its agenda., liberal measures adopted in favour of the elite and corporates will only upset the balance in the system. a vast majority already faces the daily pressures of inflation, rising food prices, poverty and hollow promises to ensure universal pds and food security., arjun.r. shankar,, thiruvananthapuram, the comparison of the total amount written off towards corporate income tax and the grand total revenue forgone under corporate income tax, excise and customs with the 2g spectrum scam is fascinating. the huge customs duty concessions allowed to corporate hospitals to import sophisticated medical equipment on the ground that 30 per cent of their beds are free of charge to the poor is unjustifiable. the truth is that the poor will never use or be able to use the services of such hospitals., b. prabha,, varkala, there is nothing wrong in giving tax concessions to corporates but it should not be at the cost of the people's welfare. the opposition, ever ready to lock horns with the government, does not raise the issue as it knows well that it would have to do the same if it came to power., talpa sai balantrapu,, bhadrachalam, the points listed only justify the prevailing economic disorder and inequity in society. the government very often boasts of the growth of gdp saying our economic fundamentals are very strong to meet challenges. no doubt, economic growth is necessary to uplift the poor. but we have many facing poverty, job loss and having to make ends meet with paltry wages. it cannot be treated as an issue of corruption but as national pillage. it may not be incorrect to call this economic terrorism., v.v.k. suresh,, guntur, while the article shows how much the country has lost, the biggest loss is the media having become

2011-03-09,where bjp hopes to mar prospects of the fronts,"a tough battle is in the offing in the capital which has acquired a new constituency profile following delimitation., the maiden contest to the assembly after the delimitation exercise poses stiff challenge to the rival left democratic front (ldf) and the united democratic front (udf) as well as the bjp, which wields considerable clout in the district., winning nine of the 14 segments viz. attingal, kilimanoor (sc), vamanapuram, nedumangad, thiruvananthapuram north, east, west, neyyattinkara and parassala, the ldf established its sway in the previous elections. the udf had to be content with varkala, aryanad, kazhakuttom, nemom and kovalam., the fronts were evenly matched in the lok sabha elections, with the udf winning thiruvananthapuram, and the ldf, the newly formed attingal. local body elections saw the udf making inroads into the ldf bastion wresting the thiruvananthapuram district panchayat and a sizeable share of panchayats from the ldf., even in the thiruvananthapuram corporation council, a stronghold of the ldf, especially the cpi(m), the ldf had to be satisfied with the majority of just one seat., the bjp too succeeded in registering its presence in the rural and urban areas of the district., while delimiting the constituencies, status quo has been maintained in terms of the number of segments. the contours of the segments have been redrawn in such a manner that thiruvananthapuram north, east, west, kilimanoor and aryanad have ceased to exist and five new constituencies, thiruvananthapuram, vattiyoorkavu, aruvikkara, chirayinkeezh and kattakada have been carved out., thus aryanad, which returned congress leader g.karthikeyan four times in a row; kilimanoor, which stood with the ldf in all elections after 1987; north, which had mostly elected ldf nominees and law minister m. vijayakumar in 2006; as well as the east and west where the ldf and the udf enjoy equal strength; have disappeared into the annals of history. the bjp too is a force to be reckoned with in all these urban segments., the most keenly watched will be the contest in the five new segments and nemom, where senior bjp leader o. rajagopal has started campaigning. both the ldf and the udf have exuded confidence of winning the five segments., the electorate, mainly upper middle class and middle class, has never been particularly loyal to any front. no precise benchmark can be set for their preferences and that factor alone makes prediction difficult., the minority communities have a decisive role in influencing the verdict. organisations like the nair service society (nss) and the sndp yogam also have the clout to sway the outcome., thiruvananthapuram segment comprises core corporation wards, former thiruvananthapuram west as well as the major portion of the east segment and parts of the north segment., aruivkkara includes eight panchayats in nedumangad taluk and vamanapuram has nine in nedumangad taluk., nedumangad constituency includes nedumangad municipality, two panchayats in nedumangad taluk and three in thiruvananthapuram taluk. sitting mla mancode radhakrishnan, cpi, has prevailed over congress leader palode ravi since 2001. mr. ravi lost by 156 votes in 2001 and 85 votes in 2006. the udf will have to make an all-out bid to regain the seat., if the cpi decides against fielding candidates who have contested twice, the ldf will field a new candidate. it remains to be seen whether mr. ravi will be fielded once again., with 18 corporation wards, kazhakuttom too has acquired an urban character. varkala, comprising varkala municipality and seven grama panchayats in chirayinkeezh taluk, is expected to witness a keen battle. the ldf succeeded in retaining the constituency thrice after 1987., the late varkala radhakrishnan was elected from here twice. since 2001, varkala kahar has been returned from the constituency. the fight in the constituency has thus become prestigious for both the fronts., attingal (sc), comprising attingal municipality and nine panchayats in chirayinkeezh taluk, and chirayinkeezh, with six panchayats in chirayinkeezh taluk and two in thiruvananthapuram, are ldf bastions., with eight panchayats in nedumangad taluk and kattakada, six panchayats in neyyattinkara taluk, aruvikkara too has gained prominence as a newly formed constituency., neyyatinkara constituency comprising neyyatinkara municipality and six panchayats in the district and the coastal kovalam segment that elected george mercier in 2006 are quite significant for the udf., while the ldf wrested neyyatinkara from the udf in 2006, it lost kovalam to mr. mercier. the udf will have to adopt new strategies to gain control of the two segments., another interesting factor with regard to kovalam is the interest evinced by a.neelalohitadas to contest from the segment. having quit the bsp and joined the janata dal, he has openly expressed his desire in contesting as ldf candidate. parassala with nine panchayats had voted in favour of both the fronts., women voters outnumber men in the district. of the 2,28,78,767 voters, there are 1,19,19,652 women and 1,09,59,115 men., campaign issues, along with the major national and regional issues, including the 2g spectrum scam, inflation and appointment of the chief vigilance commissioner, development issues are set to occupy a prime space in the campaign., the bjp has already entered the fray but it remains to be seen whether it will open account in the district. the ldf is expected to focus on the development initiatives of the government and the corruption charges levelled against the upa and the udf leaders in the state., the udf campaign will focus on the poor maintenance of roads, allegations regarding backdoor appointments and corruption charges against the ldf.",0.0759563892897226,bjp hopes mar prospects fronts,"tough battle offing capital acquired new

advantage over the rival contestants, it helps him or her hide the money spent on paid news from the mandatory electoral expenditure accounts, thereby violating electoral laws. the hindu played a key role in taking the issue to larger sections of people. many journalists pressed for the intervention of organisations such as the editors' guild, besides the press council of india and the election commission, to stigmatise and put an end to the corrupt practice and initiate action against the guilty. it is heartening that the election commission has taken some initial steps to end the menace., a front page expose, “cash for votes a way of political life in south india,” in the hindu (march 16, 2011), based on a report in “the india cables,” accessed by the newspaper through wikileaks, highlighted the various methods adopted by south indian politicians in the 2009 lok sabha election to bribe voters. in a factually rich cable sent to the state department on may 13, 2009 under the name of frederick j. kaplan, acting principal officer of the u.s. consulate-general in chennai, we have a detailed account of “the role and impact of money power in corrupting the electoral process.” mr. kaplan noted that the bribing of voters by political parties was “a regular feature of elections in south india.” referring to an assembly by-election at thirumangalam in madurai district in 2009, the cable mentioned how party workers resorted to ingenious ways to distribute the bribe money, hoodwinking security officials and the workers of rival political parties. at thirumangalam the payment was rs. 5,000 per voter, possibly the highest ever bribe paid to a voter, according to the cable. this is now known as the “thirumangalam formula,” thanks to liberal usage of the term in tamil periodicals., apart from the unprecedented rise in prices of essential commodities, the neglect of agriculture and growing unemployment, the major issues before the electorate in the current phase of the elections are the 2g-spectrum scam and the plethora of corruption scandals involving ruling party politicians at the centre and in the states., although electoral malpractices and corruption in high places are not new to the people, apprehension of a possible scaling up of electoral malpractices and the violence they might result in has made the election commission step up its vigil in a big way. the challenge is particularly serious in tamil nadu and the shrill complaints and criticism heard from leaders of the parties ruling in the state and at the centre speak to the eci's rising to the challenge. the seizure of cash to the tune of at least rs. 42 crore and of articles worth several crores of rupees carried by persons with no valid papers relating to the money in their possession only strengthens the case for stepped-up vigil by the commission., chief election commissioner s.y. quraishi has done well to face the situation head-on and refute the charge that the election commission has exceeded its powers in tamil nadu. he has emphasised that the commission was within its constitutional mandate and any criticism was “totally unfair and we dismiss it.” he made it clear that holding free and fair elections was always the commission's top priority and it would also seek to make the polls peaceful, transparent, and participative. his announcement that the commission had asked officials to intensify search operations with a view to totally curbing “money power” has won much public appreciation and support., it is encouraging to see the news media giving such wide publicity to the election commission's efforts to clean up the whole process. so far, so good.",0.07130789022298456,"paid news , cash-for-votes , election commission","s. viswanathan , readers ’

2011-04-27,small but significant step,"the supplementary charge sheet in the 2g spectrum allocation case is a small but significant step for the central bureau of investigation in what is clearly a difficult journey in pursuit of truth and justice. the first charge sheet kept out some sensitive names for reasons of political expediency. the second deals mostly with one money trail, involving about rs.200 crore, from swan telecom to kalaignar tv, which is but a small part of the rs.22,000 crore that the cbi estimates to be the loss to the government in the spectrum scam. however, in the context of the criminal investigation of the case, this money trail plays a crucial role by laying bare an intricate web of financial transactions which, decoded, could establish a quid pro quo between politicians in power and businessmen who benefited from the manipulation of the ‘first-come, first-served' policy in spectrum allocation. true, kalaignar tv paid back the amount with interest, but this was only between december 2010 and february 2011 after the cbi registered the case, which seemed more like a cover-up attempt. moreover, during the period of the transaction between december 2008 and august 2009, the paid-up equity of kalaignar tv was merely rs.10.01 crore, and its entire income for the year ending march 31, 2009 rs.47.54 crore. not surprisingly, the judge of the special court, taking cognisance of the charge sheet, said he was satisfied that there was “enough incriminating material on record to proceed against the accused persons.”",0.030505952380952377,small significant step,"supplementary charge sheet 2g spectrum allocation case small significant step central bureau investigation clearly difficult journey pursuit truth justice. first charge sheet kept sensitive names reasons political expediency. second deals mostly one money trail , involving rs.200 crore , swan telecom kalaignar tv , small part rs.22,000 crore cbi estimates loss government spectrum scam. however , context criminal investigation case , money trail plays crucial role laying bare intricate web financial transactions , decoded , could establish quid pro quo politicians power businessmen benefited manipulation ‘first-come , first-served ' policy spectrum allocation. true , kalaignar tv paid back amount interest , december 2010 february 2011 cbi registered case , seemed like cover-up attempt. moreover , period transaction december 2008 august 2009 , paid-up equity kalaignar tv merely rs.10.01 crore , entire income year ending march 31 , 2009 rs.47.54 crore. surprisingly , judge special court , taking cognisance charge sheet , said satisfied “enough incriminating material record proceed accused persons . ”","{'bjp': 0, 'cong': 0}",0,0

2011-05-10,the prime minister and the cbi,"“… it the cbi has always to do what is right and correct. for an investigating agency, there can be only one guiding beacon, only one gold standard, and that is the law of the land. whoever transgresses it, however mighty, has to be brought to book.”, those were bold words indeed from prime minister manmohan singh, who also said on april 30, after inaugurating the new building housing the headquarters of the central bureau investigation (cbi) in new delhi, that the cbi should act without fear or favour. the premier criminal investigation agency needed more physical space to work in and a more congenial work environment for its 5,000-plus staff members. it has now got this reward after decades of hard and sustained labour under trying circumstances., nobody will ever grudge more facilities being given to the cbi to enable it to discharge its duties. its workload has increased phenomenally over time: more than a thousand new cases are entrusted to it each year, and there is a huge backlog in courts in various parts of india. a larger workforce, and more tangible incentives for its officers to cope with the burden and proceed methodically with the work, are legitimate dues. the governments headed by the national democratic alliance (nda) and the united progressive alliance (upa) have been more than generous in this respect, and both need to be complimented for their vision., however, every government has its own resources crunch and cannot go on spending lavishly to buttress a criminal investigation agency. at the same time, lack of money should not prove to be a limiting factor, for the cbi needs to be made a top-class outfit that is on a par with the federal bureau of investigation of the united states. anything less does not match india's image as a growing force in the comity of nations. subjecting the cbi severely to bureaucratic prescriptions of effecting economy in administration will be preposterous and disastrous., the prime minister's assurance that his government would be generous in giving the organisation what it needs is gratifying. it is to be hoped that his top babus would not lag behind and that they would be forthcoming in implementing their leader's promises. it is known to many how a secretary to the government can sabotage with impunity what his minister promises., the prime minister has made it clear that he would like to see a sleek cbi that acts without prejudice and avoids harassing innocent persons. these are words of wisdom that should influence even operatives at the lowest level in the agency and convince the people that despite occasional aberrations, the upa government means well by the organisation. it is easy to be critical of the executive for its efforts — often subtle, sometimes blatant — to influence the cbi's decisions in sensitive cases. the fact is that no political party is without blame in trying to arm-twist the cbi director. let us therefore not point fingers to indict this or that government as being more guilty of the obnoxious and questionable tactics that go with the pattern all over the world, of the executive arm of the government trying to subjugate investigation agencies to suit its own caprice and will., on its part, the cbi also has to do a lot of introspection and some spring-cleaning with regard to its internal processes in order not to give ammunition to its tendentious detractors. the one stick with which the agency is often beaten relates to its tendency to prolong investigations. the charge is not without basis. this is somewhat analogous to the accusations against the judiciary for not doing enough to speed up trials., the apparent sloth in this area is explained by several factors. these include the non-availability of critical documents, non-receipt of expert opinion on the genuineness of documents, audio-video recording, and samples collected at the scene of a crime. another factor is indolence on the part of ministries in according permission to the cbi to initiate an enquiry/investigation and in sanctioning prosecution of a public servant once the cbi has garnered enough evidence to prove guilt., perhaps the most unjustified and deplorable among the fetters imposed on the cbi is the infamous ‘single directive,' which found legal sanctity under the nda government in 2003 through incorporation in the central vigilance commission act. (under this directive, the cbi needs the permission of the ministry concerned before undertaking even a preliminary enquiry against an officer of and above the rank of a joint secretary.), equally relevant is the prolonged correspondence with foreign governments and courts in cases that require investigation on external soil. the bofors investigation is a classic example. a whole book can be written on how, in this instance, red tape and protocol issues helped neutralise solid evidence of guilt and greed, built up over a decade through assiduous investigations., there are many similar impediments that come in the way of the cbi being able to complete its investigations swiftly, especially in sensitive cases. if the cbi still managed to file two charge sheets recently in the 2g spectrum scam investigation, it is a tribute to its perseverance and hard-work. (no doubt, supreme court monitoring was earlier the prime mover that set off positive responses from the cbi.), this does not, however, mask the fact that some cbi officers at all levels are themselves prone to lethargy. fortunately, the number of such officers is not too large. this writer knows for a fact that supervisory officers of the cbi are driven hard to quicken the process of investigation in many cases, and a provision for periodic stocktaking by the director himself is built into the system. the cbi owes it to society to speed up all its investigations, whether they are major or minor, by cutting out traditional requirements that do not have legal sanction., in a number of cases, far too many witnesses are being examined and far too many documents summoned than are required. the agency has a well-equipped computer system, and this has to be harnessed to the maximum so that manual methods of storing and retrieving crucial data are jettisoned. technology is not only the answer to subjectivity, but a tool to facilitate expeditious handling of matters that are intimately linked to a fair investigation., none of this will, however, eliminate the widely held suspicion that the cbi is the handmaiden of the ruling party or alliance. this is why there is a clamour to free it from the dictates of the executive. the prime minister said that the current crop of sensitive investigations (it was an obvious reference to the 2g spectrum scam, the adarsh society affair and the cwg scandal) would constitute a litmus test for the cbi., the citizens of india will apply the same test to the prime minister in the matter of conferring near-total autonomy to the cbi. while the agency will depend on the government for logistic support, it will be accountable only to the law (read the supreme court and the high courts), and no one else, in investigating cases and sending up the accused to the courts for trial., ensuring this will require the enactment by parliament of a clear-cut cbi act, a draft of which is being done by the cbi. (several such drafts are languishing at the cbi headquarters or in north block, for want of a political will.) if the elusive institution of the lokpal does ultimately come into existence, the cbi ought to become a part of it to supervise its investigative functions. the leader of the opposition should also be involved in the choice of the director of the cbi, just as in the case of the chief vigilance commissioner. finally, it should be laid down that for five years after retirement a cbi director shall not be eligible for any post to which the appointment is made by the government. this will greatly enhance his capacity to take a totally independent position, especially during his last days in office.",0.08778981372163193,prime minister cbi,"“ … cbi always right correct. investigating agency , one guiding beacon , one gold standard , law land. whoever transgresses , however mighty , brought book. ” , bold words indeed prime minister manmohan singh , also said april 30 , inaugurating new building housing headquarters central bureau investigation ( cbi ) new delhi , cbi act without fear favour. premier criminal investigation agency needed physical space work congenial work environment 5,000-plus staff members. got reward decades hard sustained labour trying circumstances. , nobody ever grudge facilities given cbi enable discharge duties. workload increased phenomenally time : thousand new cases entrusted year , huge backlog courts various parts india. larger workforce , tangible incentives officers cope burden proceed methodically work , legitimate dues. governments headed national democratic alliance ( nda ) united progressive alliance ( upa ) generous respect , need complimented vision. , however , every government resources crunch cannot go spending lavishly buttress criminal investigation agency. time , lack money prove limiting factor , cbi needs made top-class outfit par federal bureau investigation united states. anything less match india ' image growing force comity nations. subjecting cbi severely bureaucratic prescriptions effecting economy administration preposterous disastrous. , prime minister ' assurance government would generous giving organisation needs gratifying. hoped top babus would lag behind would forthcoming implementing leader ' promises. known many secretary government sabotage impunity minister promises. , prime minister made clear would like see sleek cbi acts without prejudice avoids harassing innocent persons. words wisdom influence even operatives lowest level agency convince people despite occasional aberrations , upa government means well organisation. easy critical executive efforts — often subtle , sometimes blatant — influence cbi ' decisions sensitive cases. fact political party without blame trying arm-twist cbi director. let us therefore point fingers indict government guilty obnoxious questionable tactics go pattern world , executive arm government trying subjugate investigation agencies suit caprice will. , part , cbi also lot introspection spring-cleaning regard internal processes order give ammunition tendentious detractors. one stick agency often beaten relates tendency prolong investigations. charge without basis. somewhat analogous accusations judiciary enough speed trials. , apparent sloth area explained several factors. include non-availability critical documents , non-receipt expert opinion genuineness documents , audio-video recording , samples collected scene crime. another factor indolence part ministries according permission cbi initiate enquiry/investigation sanctioning prosecution public servant cbi garnered enough evidence prove guilt. , perhaps unjustified deplorable among fetters imposed cbi infamous ‘single directive , ' found legal sanctity nda government 2003 incorporation central vigilance commission act.

2011-05-14,three state wins but no national booster shot for congress,"as the only player with a major stake in all five assemblies and at the centre, the congress can at best draw limited comfort from friday's election results. the party registered an impressive victory in assam, where chief minister tarun gogoi stormed back to power with a higher number of seats than before. but in kerala, the congress-led united democratic front (udf) defeated the left by the slenderest of margins, while in west bengal the party crossed the winning line only because it tied itself firmly to mamata banerjee's pallu., to these victories must be added the losses: a humiliating defeat for the dmk-led coalition in tamil nadu, the loss of the puducherry assembly to an ex-congressman, and a complete drubbing in two crucial by-elections in andhra pradesh, where the rebel son and wife of the late chief minister, y.s. rajasekhara reddy, won the kadapa lok sabha seat and the pulivendula assembly seat respectively with record margins., these defeats have tempered the congress' joy at recapturing kerala and displacing the left from west bengal for the first time in 34 years, but the party is in no mood to introspect. worse, its leadership has not realised that the national impact of the three provincial wins is less than the sum of its parts. far from providing a much-needed booster shot to the congress at the centre, verdict 2011 has revealed the electoral weakness of its immune system., let's take the statistics first. between them, kerala, west bengal and assam brought in 48 lok sabha seats for the united progressive alliance in the 2009 general election out of a possible 76. tamil nadu and puducherry brought in 28 seats. extrapolating from the present trend, the 2014 election will see the upa losing seats in tamil nadu., these losses can be offset by gains in assam but not in kerala, where the udf's performance in 2011 suggests even a repeat of its 16 out of 20 performance is unlikely. in west bengal, there is scope for the upa to increase its lok sabha tally by a few more seats, but the beneficiary will be mamata's trinamool rather than the congress. finally, y.s. jagan mohan reddy's stunning win in kadapa, taken together with the telangana knot the congress has tied for itself, puts a question mark over its future prospects in andhra pradesh. in 2009, the state returned 33 party mps. it will take a miracle to match those numbers in 2014., if the congress faces bleak prospects at the centre despite winning three states, the bharatiya janata party — which wasn't really in the fray in any of the five assembly races — may paradoxically have some reason to cheer. that virtually all of its candidates in west bengal, assam, kerala and tamil nadu drew a blank gives a serious jolt to its “national” pretensions. but the victory of the upa in west bengal and kerala is seen by bjp strategists as a good thing because the left's defeat buries the ‘third front' idea for at least the current national election cycle. in a polity that is more bipolar than before, the party feels it has a better chance of eventually bringing regional players like the biju janata dal in orissa and even the aiadmk of jayalalithaa back into the national democratic alliance's orbit., in addition, the tamil nadu result could give a boost to the bjp campaign at the centre on the corruption issue, especially since it need no longer fear the left reaping collateral benefit from the manmohan singh government's vulnerability., three years is, of course, a very long time in politics, and there is no reason to assume the electoral appeal of the congress cannot grow. for that to happen, however, the party will have to internalise the three big lessons that the five assembly results have thrown up., the first lesson is that the electorate cares about corruption and wants the guilty to be punished. while many factors contributed to the defeat of the dmk-congress combine in tamil nadu, the 2g spectrum scam played an important role. the arrest of a. raja and the chargesheeting of kanimozhi do not appear to have done much for the congress. in kerala, the popular perception of congress complicity — and the left front's own record in providing clean governance — is one reason why the party failed to fully capitalise on the anti-incumbency mood

2011-05-17,no end soon to pesky calls and sms,"last year, a meeting between finance minister pranab mukherjee and opposition leaders to find a way to end the logjam in parliament over the 2g spectrum scam was interrupted by a telemarketing call. his terse comment – “they don't even spare me” – at the meeting prompted the then communications and information technology minister, a. raja, to order immediate action to check the menace of pesky calls and sms., soon the telecom regulatory authority of india (trai) came out with fresh guidelines, which included higher penalty, aimed at reining in telemarketing companies, and had set january 1, 2011, as the deadline to implement it. but the department of telecommunications is still to devise a mechanism to filter telemarketing calls and sms. since then, four deadlines have been missed, the latest one being march 21, 2011; and it looks like the solution to this problem is still at least a year away., in its regulations to curb unsolicited calls and sms, trai asked dot to allocate identifiable series of phone number for telemarketers or mobile advertisers. subsequently, dot identified “140” series for this purpose, which has led to technical problems., issuing a 10-digit series for mobiles is not an issue; the problem is with landline phones as the state-owned bsnl will take at least 10 months to make technical changes such as configuration of networks and putting in place filtering solutions, to implement the new series. both mr. chandrasekhar and mr. sarma have now refused to give any fresh deadline to implement the new guidelines., unlike its previous mechanism of “do not call registry,” where a subscriber needed to register with operators to bar telemarketers from calling them or sending messages, trai's new guidelines on unsolicited commercial communications (uccs) say a user will now have to register his mobile number to get such calls and sms. the new rules say no calls or sms can be sent between 9 p.m. and 9 a.m., while a penalty of up to rs.2.50 lakh will be levied on erring telemarketing firms which will also face blacklisting for two years., additional revenue, as the ordeal of mobile users with telemarketing companies or mobile advertisers continues, mobile operators are happy to earn additional revenue from this business. apart from pesky calls, the business of unwarranted sms has now become a major concern as an average user receives at least 10-15 such smses everyday, thanks to the business of bulk sms being offered by mobile operators and other companies., while some old operators such as bharti airtel have stopped offering bulk sms that put pressure on their network due to scarcity of spectrum, for new ones it has become an important source of revenue. industry estimates suggest that the bulk sms business is worth around rs.300 crore to rs.350 crore, with over 15,000 crore bulk messages being sent to mobile users every year.",0.07140151515151516,end soon pesky calls sms,"last year , meeting finance minister pranab mukherjee opposition leaders find way end logjam parliament 2g spectrum scam interrupted telemarketing call. terse comment – “they ' even spare ” – meeting prompted communications information technology minister , a. raja , order immediate action check menace pesky calls sms. , soon telecom regulatory authority india ( trai ) came fresh guidelines , included higher penalty , aimed reining telemarketing companies , set january 1 , 2011 , deadline implement it. department telecommunications still devise mechanism filter telemarketing calls sms. since , four deadlines missed , latest one march 21 , 2011 ;

2011-05-21,media matters - partisan stances,"aligned media in india are growing in number, and are increasingly identifiable by party or personality allegiance rather than by ideological affinity. there is no liberal and conservative divide here. except for newspapers and tv channels identified with the left formations in west bengal and kerala, politically aligned media in states like tamil nadu, andhra pradesh, assam, and west bengal are difficult to identify on the basis of ideological bias. they are spawned by political families and promote specific parties. or they are owned by business groups with political allegiance. and when the owner falls out with his party, they promote the owner! the latest round of elections, including the by-election in kadapa in andhra pradesh, has helped to delineate the emerging contours of aligned media in this country., jaya tv and kalaignar tv in tamil nadu are primarily political vehicles and make no bones about it. they sport the party symbol as their logo. joining them is channel 10 from west bengal, which seems to have emerged primarily to be a vehicle for mamata banerjee and the trinamool party. sakshi in andhra pradesh was founded by the late y.s.r. reddy's family to gift his party with a large media house equipped to counter the telugu desam party's media loyalists. while ysr was alive nobody could have foreseen that the newspaper and news channel would end up increasingly becoming a family weapon, deployable against the congress party too when required., we may never know for sure how much of a role sakshi newspaper and tv played in securing jagan reddy's five lakh margin, but it cannot have hurt to have captive media with the sort of circulation sakshi had attained very quickly., studion in andhra pradesh, the tv channel acquired by chandrababu naidu's son, helps to serve the media needs of the tdp. last november, however, it was happy to lend its platform to congressmen faithful to the high command who used it to criticise both jagan reddy and sakshi., then there are media vehicles owned by political families which are conducted like professional news businesses, even if they promote the party cause when required. sakshi the newspaper in fact belonged to this category in its initial years. a current example is news live in assam, owned by the wife of himanta biswa sarma, a congress leader. and though sun tv may have been seen in its early days as a dmk vehicle, housed in the party headquarters, it has left that stage far behind and is a flourishing, professional media business, quite happy to annoy dmk politicians with its news reporting when necessary. it is kalaignar tv which has taken over the role of being a house channel for the dmk and was seen as a clear beneficiary of political clout, even before it began to figure in the 2g spectrum scam., the giveaway, how does one separate those that are primarily political vehicles from those which value their role as professional news media? by watching the news component of the channels. jaya tv and kalaignar were not dissimilar in the run up to polling day. the entire news bulletin would be focused on each party's campaign and leader. on jaya tv jayalalitha was the face of the campaign, occupying the tv screen for at least 20 minutes of the 30-minute bulletin, on kalaigar you got a greater array of family members, the kalaignar himself giving an interview or a speech, m.k. stalin claiming a wave in favour of dmk, m.k. alagiri saying jayalaitha was afraid of being beaten by vijayakanth, and so on. on her channel, jayalaitha returned the attacks: “corruption on this scale not seen anywhere in the world,” she said. the rest of the day these channels show entertainment. while much has been made of how quickly kalaignar tv switched to movies on the day results came in, jaya tv too was showing an old jayalalitha and mgr movie after she finished her press conference on the day of her victory., channel 10 in kolkata has a totally unhurried one-and-a-half hour evening news slot which before the polls resonated each day with the word poriborton. the only visuals were those of the trinamool leader. in the week before polling it was fascinating to watch kunal ghosh, the ceo of the sharda media group which owns the channel, steer the discussion. a long defence of mamta banerjee using helicopters, an equally long defence on how the group's newspaper, pratidin and channel 10 got land for their premises. the rest of the time actors (mithun chakraborty) painters, poets, and others discussed what needed to be done in bengal. on the poila baishakh edition of this news slot, people sang, painted, recited poetry. nothing dry about mamata banerjee's propaganda vehicle, which also has a daily bollywood bulletin called enter-10. all propaganda vehicles seem to know the value of offering entertainment., in contrast, chobbish ghanta, the vehicle for the left, looks and sounds much more like a news channel. on the final voting day the anchor went to reporters in different parts of the state, asking restrained, rather than leading questions. and every reporter stolidly said that it was proving very difficult to read the voter's mind! the same day of course star ananda reporters were having no difficulty reading the voters' mind. while the investment in chobbish ghanta is from zee, its editorial operation is headed by an assistant editor at the cpm newspaper ganashakti., kerala too has its share of aligned media, the cpm-owned newspaper deshabhimani, and the kairali tv bouquet, owned by malayalam communications ltd., begun many years ago with shareholding from cpm supporters, and mentored in its early years by cpm leaders like m.a. baby., then there is doordarshan which does its own bit of party pushing when it can. track their bulletins in west bengal and tamil nadu and you can see a discernable bias in terms of space given to the ally of the congress party in that state., sun news and news live are in the chobbish ghanta category, in terms of being much more professional sounding news channels. but if you wanted critical views on the congress performance in assam, you were more likely to get it on another assamese channel, dy 365. every politically aligned professional channel has learned how and when to criticise its own party. and when to concede that the opposition is gaining ground.",0.10534045815295814,media matters - partisan stances,"aligned media india growing number , increasingly identifiable party personality allegiance rather ideological affinity. liberal conservative divide here. except newspapers tv channels identified left formations west bengal kerala , politically aligned media states like tamil nadu , andhra pradesh , assam , west bengal difficult identify basis ideological bias. spawned political families promote specific parties. owned business groups political allegiance. owner falls party , promote owner !

2011-06-02,telecom scandal,"the editorial “the habit of covering up” (june 2) has raised pertinent questions regarding the involvement of ministers and bigwigs other than a. raja in the 2g spectrum scandal before 2007-08, and the whereabouts of the rest of the money. the declared maxims of sonia gandhi and the proclaimed principles of prime minister manmohan singh are evidently not being practised. dr. singh should ask textiles minister dayanidhi maran to resign. the questions on his alleged acts favouring his family-run sun direct tv pvt. ltd. need to be examined seriously., b. rajasekaran, bangalore, the reports that the former telecom minister's policies benefited the company of sun tv network owned by his brother kalanidhi maran has brought to light yet another case of alleged misuse of power by the dmk ministers. the sequence of events — from the change of fdi norms in the telecom sector, the maxis group acquiring a 74 per cent stake in aircel, the telecom ministry granting 14 2-g unified access services licences to aircel and the maxis group's subsequent investment in sun direct tv pvt. limited — points to a very clear route map of misuse of power. the nation is already shocked by the mega spectrum scam, in which too dmk members have been charge sheeted. with the latest disclosures, the credibility of the upa government, particularly the dmk functionaries, has been eroded., muralidharan raju iyer, chennai, the editorial is incisive, thought-provoking and timely. if the upa government refuses to see the writing on the wall even now, it will have only itself to blame for the inevitable catastrophe., v. balasubramanian, coimbatore, for the dmk, already beleaguered by the arrest of rajya sabha mp kanimozhi in connection with the 2g spectrum issue and the defeat in the recent tamil nadu assembly elections, the maran episode has brought more trouble. the revelations about the textile minister's alleged moves favouring his family during his tenure as telecom minister have given the opposition yet another chance to put the upa government in a spot. it will be interesting to see how the congress, which promised to take corruption head on, responds., pratham dwivedi, new delhi, dr singh, in spite of his proven uprightness, honesty and integrity, has become a soft target. he is like the captain of a ship caught in a vicious storm. he can resign. but imagine the chaos that will follow. dr. singh should tell himself ‘thus far and no more.' he should expose the corrupt so that the nation is rid of the bad elements., j.v. reddy, nellore, the habit of covering up under the stewardship of dr. singh has come to such a pass that he is forced to send an entourage of his cabinet to a baba to persuade him not to go on a fast. the cartoon (june 2) says it all so poignantly., kasim sait, chennai, there seems no end to the predilections of upa-ii. more skeletons tumble out of its cupboard with each passing day. the mere detention of a few politicians and business tycoons is not enough, as there is something more to the 2g scam than meets the eye., h.p. murali, bangalore, i fully agree with the views expressed in the editorial. mr maran needs to do a lot of explaining. his mere denial in terse phrases cannot sell as similar and, perhaps, more vociferous denials issued by another central minister have been laid bare now., on a wider note, what is worrying is the magnitude of the scams that keep surfacing day after day. the prime minister can no longer remain silent. the nation expects him to act., r. kalyanaraman, chennai, dr.

2011-06-27,anything can happen before 2014: jayalalithaa,"all india anna dravida munnetra kazhagam leader and tamil nadu chief minister jayalalithaa, who had made an offer of support to the united progressive alliance on november 11, 2010, prior to a. raja's removal as telecom minister, has reiterated that it was only a one-time offer; there was no question now of working with the congress. she said a political realignment could happen before the 2014 general elections. “anything can happen anytime,” she said when asked about the possibility of elections before 2014. the people wanted a strong and authoritative government to give them a sense of security. she did not rule out the possibility of national political realignment in the near future but did not explain why she felt such a realignment can happen anytime soon. she made it clear that she had moved on from 1999 when she withdrew support to the vajpayee government, leading to its downfall: in the present context she might have acted differently. she did not rule out the possibility of a third front emerging, or the possibility of her being a part of it., excerpts from an interview the chief minister gave arnab goswami, editor-in-chief of the times now television channel, in chennai on june 27., ms. jayalalithaa, i've always considered you to be forthright and direct. when you spoke to me last on november 11, 2010, you made a dramatic offer, and i'm quoting you: you said if required the aiadmk would be willing to support the central government. may i ask you ma'am, the circumstance and context in which you said that, and how you look back at it now?, in november 2010, the entire political situation was different. at that time, the centre had not taken any action against those involved in the 2g spectrum scam. though the nation was expecting it, no action was taken. so at that time there was a feeling that the centre was hesitating due to the compulsions of coalition politics. so that's why i made the offer, so that the congress could feel assured, so that it would not have to suffer in case the dmk withdrew support to the government…. it was in that context that i made the offer, so that the congress that was heading the coalition at the centre would be reassured, so that if it did take strong action against corruption the government would not suffer and the government would not fall because of such action. so that they could continue. it was to give them that reassurance and the confidence that i made that offer. but now, the situation has totally changed. the congress has made it clear that it has an alliance with the dmk, and it did face the elections with the dmk. and even after the results were known and they suffered a massive defeat, the congress continues to say that they have an alliance with dmk, and it continues to be a part of the ruling coalition. and till date it is an important part of the alliance., so, why were they so cool to your offer at that point of time? because it was a very explicit offer. in fact you even put out the numbers. you said to them that the congress does not want to lose the support of those 18, but now, and i'm quoting you, the dmk's position has become untenable, raja's position became untenable. in fact raja went three days after my question. ms. jayalalithaa, why were they cool to you? and do you think you set the ball rolling for raja's ouster?, that's what the entire nation felt and said. but as to why the congress didn't take up my offer, you should put it to the congress. it's all history to me, it's in the past. it was a totally different scenario, it's a totally different situation in politics now. it doesn't exist anymore., but don't you think political alliances, ms. jayalalithaa… the congress leaders have said, and i'm quoting them, that the relationship with the dmk and the case against mr. raja are not related. that's what they say., but that's not the way the nation sees it, that's not the way the people see it., but my question again, ms. jayalalithaa — i'm going to be persistent on this — i can't fathom why they said no to you. the relationship with the dmk did not work electorally, they had a standing offer from you and yet they didn't take up the offer, act on raja. it's a bit of a piecemeal effort, isn't it?, you used the words ‘standing offer.' it wasn't a standing offer i made in november. it wasn't a standing offer. and i repeat, as to why the congress didn't take up that offer, they should answer it, they are the best judges and they should answer your question. as far as i'm concerned, i made that offer in a particular context, in a particular situation. and as far as i'm concerned, that situation doesn't exist anymore., do you think coalition politics with a greater role for regional players is the order of the day?, i can't make any predictions, i'm not an astrologer. but in trying to answer your questions, i can only say that it does seem that the days of single party majority rule are over. i think we are destined to live with coalition governments in the future. i don't think any party is capable of getting a single majority on its own., by that definition, you as leader of one of the largest parties apart from the congress and the bjp in the present political situation in india, in 2014… you will be a major player. you can't restrict yourself to chennai., let's wait for the next general election to come around. it's hardly been a month, a month and a half or may be a little over a month since i took over. let's see how this turns out., can i please interpret your earlier answer… you seem to indicate a mid-term election could happen, before 2014?, anything can happen at any time. i didn't say something would happen. anything can happen. we have to be prepared., prior to 2014?, possibly, anything can happen., why do you say so?, no, i don't want to elaborate., everyone is very keen to know what you have been talking to top bjp leaders, and there has been a great deal of attention paid to your meeting with sushma swaraj, on the fact that narendra modi being present at your swearing-in ceremony, a very important gesture. ideologically, surely you have no differences with the bjp in terms of working with them?, earlier, when mr. narendra modi was sworn in as the chief minister for the second time, i attended his swearing-in ceremony in ahmedabad in 2002. so modi returned the compliment now when i was sworn in. when you refer to sushma swaraj, you are omitting sheila dikshit. both ms. sheila dikshit and sushma swaraj are very charming and gracious ladies, both are my friends and paid courtesy calls, and especially called on me to congratulate me on my victory in the recent assembly elections. mr. ravi shankar prasad is a very good friend of mine and has appeared as a lawyer for me in some cases, so we know each other really well. so, we call on each other when we get the chance., people say narendra modi could be a prime ministerial candidate of the bjp, sushma could be prime ministerial candidate. so there is a slight difference between them and sheila dikshit and the two other leaders who you mentioned. therefore, the general feeling is that everyone in the bjp, especially those who are aspirants for the top job, would believe that they can't get there without your support. do you feel that is not an important inference for us to draw about your meetings with the bjp?, i've friends in all parties. my friends have spread all over the political spectrum, so i have good friends in the bjp, the congress and other political parties too. they call on me as friends. they are friendly visits, and if you choose to read more into it, then i'm not responsible for it. it's not my problem., the congress party said when the gujarat chief minister was here at your swearing-in ceremony: they said, i don't think there needs to be any elaboration that the gujarat chief minister has orchestrated the worst genocide in independent india and therefore should not be touched with a barge pole. this comment was made only because modi came here for your swearing-in ceremony, let's not get into a discussion on narendra modi. he is a good friend, that's all., when you look back at 1998-99, you said that time moves on and political views change. the reasons for which you had differences with the nda in 1999, and now when you look at it in 2011... could there be a fresh start?, any person evolves with time and experience. it's the same with any political leader. if the same situation that occurred in 1999 had arisen today, i'd have acted differently and responded differently. you gain experience as time goes on. so, what was your question?, when you look back at 1999, the circumstances in which you withdrew your support to the nda and in 2011 when you look back, you say that things move on, you say you could have reacted differently?, i'd like to stress on one thing: if you constantly keep looking back and harping on what goes on in the past, you cannot go on, can't do politics. so if you insist on what transpired in the past, and you dwell on issues that happened in the past, you're stagnating. you're preventing yourself from moving forward. as far as i am concerned, i live in the present and look towards the future., in today's political environment, if jayalalithaa is ambivalent — not ambivalent perhaps, but equidistant from both the parties — then that would throw up a whirlwind of opportunities for political parties in delhi. what about the possibility of a third front? it did badly in the 2009 elections. do you think, given the federal structure of our politics and the fact that the states need a greater voice at the centre, that it is realistic or unrealistic… or perhaps a third front in the future?, anything can happen in politics, and particularly in india anything can happen in indian politics. so let's wait and see what the future throws up., would it be unrealistic to think about it?, i said let's wait and see what the future throws up. the future may not be so long away either., why do you say that? the future is quite far away as of now., well, that's what you think, but there could be changes earlier. as i said, you never know what will happen because one can generally sense what is the mood of the people. the people of this country want a change. they want a strong government in the centre. they want a strong, authoritative government at the centre. they want a government that will have a no-nonsense attitude towards corruption, and they want a government that will provide security against our unfriendly, hostile neighbours. so anything can happen in the future., i would request you to give your observations on the national mood. you've seen the lokpal debate. where do you stand on the issue of, say the inclusion of the prime minister in the lokpal bill, an issue which the government clearly is not keen to discuss?, i will enunciate my views very clearly. the proposed lokpal bill should exclude the prime minister for the following reasons: the prime minister is already covered under the prevention of corruption act. any misconduct by the prime minister can be investigated by the cbi. sometimes the lokpal could be used by foreign powers to destabilise the government. but when a frivolous and politically motivated complaint against the prime minister is referred before the lokpal and if the same is telecast by the tv channels — which will run it round-the-clock — it would dent the prime minister's credibility and authority. even if nothing comes out of it, it will seriously dent the authority of the prime minister., the lokpal can investigate all allegations, and therefore when the allegations are levelled against the prime minister, when a complaint is put before the lokpal, he will be put on the defensive and will be occupied in defending himself. in such an event, how can the government which is reliant on the prime minister work? the functioning of the lokpal, inclusive of the prime minister, will pave the way for a parallel government which will undermine the authority of the prime minister. the state government of tamil nadu hasn't given its view, since no final draft has been arrived at. the lokpal is much more than what is envisaged in the pca. the state's view is that the lokpal is much more than has been envisaged. the state's view can be formulated only after the final draft is given in parliament. that's my view i have enunciated., there are two ways in which politicians can be at the national level. it's inevitable that you'll play a role at the national level…, that's your assessment., it has been the experience in the past., i take it as a compliment, thank you very much., what about a national role? is it impossible to conjecture that you will look for a larger role for your party and yourself at the national level? please don't dodge the question.",0.07025482697261838,anything happen 2014 : jayalalithaa,"india anna dravida munnetra kazhagam leader tamil nadu chief minister jayalalithaa , made

2011-06-30,lokpal bill and the prime minister,"new delhi, 14/06/2011: prime minister manmohan singh during a ceremonial reception to borut pahor, prime minister of the republic of slovenia at rashtrapati bhavan in new delhi. photo: v.v.krishnan | photo credit: v_v_krishnan , the indian citizenry is up in arms against corruption at the highest levels of government. anna hazare's movement has caught the people's imagination. the former president, a.p.j. abdul kalam, has pitched in and called upon the youth to start a mass movement against corruption under the banner “what can i give?” (the hindu, june 27, 2011)., according to a crisil report (the hindu, june 29, 2011), inflation has caused the indian public to be squeezed to the extent of rs. 2.3 lakh crores. according to the comptroller and auditor general of india (cag), the estimate of loss to the exchequer owing to the 2g spectrum scam is rs. 1.22 lakh crores., that corruption is a disease consuming the body politic is a fear expressed by dignitaries in india over many years. as far back as 1979, justice v.r. krishna iyer observed in a judgment in his inimitable style: “fearless investigation is a ‘sine qua non' of exposure of delinquent ‘greats' and if the investigative agencies tremble to probe or make public the felonies of high office, white-collar offenders in the peaks may be unruffled by the law. an independent investigative agency to be set in motion by any responsible citizen is a desideratum.”, mark the words: fearless investigation by an independent investigative agency against delinquent ‘greats'. a good lokpal bill has to be nothing less., it is in this context that this article addresses the issue of whether the prime minister should be brought under the ambit of an ombudsman (lokpal) and be subject to its scrutiny. it is important to observe that in most of the lokpal bills, including the 2010 government draft (except the 1985 version), the prime minister is within the ambit of the lokpal., the constitution, under the indian constitution there is no provision to give immunity to the prime minister, chief ministers or ministers. under article 361, immunity from criminal proceedings is conferred on the president and the governor (formerly the rajpramukh) only “during his term of office.”, so what is the principle behind such immunity being given? the line is clearly drawn. constitutional heads who do not directly exercise executive powers are given immunity as heads of state. active politicians such as ministers, who cannot remain aloof from the hurly-burly of electoral and party politics, ethical or unethical, honest or corrupt, are not given any immunity. they are subject to penal laws and criminal liability., the basic structure of the constitution clearly denies immunity to the prime minister., internal emergency, during the period of the internal emergency (1975-77), indira gandhi enjoyed dictatorial powers. she detained without trial prominent opposition leaders and was supported by a captive and rump parliament., the constitution (fortieth amendment) bill was moved in, and passed by, the rajya sabha in august 1975 and later it was to go before the lok sabha. the bill was blacked out from the media and hence very few people knew about it. it never became law because it was not moved in the lok sabha., the bill sought to amend article 361 by substituting sub-clause (2) thus: “(2) no criminal proceedings whatsoever, against or concerning a person who is or has been the president or the prime minister or the governor of a state, shall lie in any court, or shall be instituted or continued in any court in respect of any act done by him, whether before he entered upon his office or during his term of office as president or prime minister or governor of a state, as the case may be, and no process whatsoever including process for arrest or imprisonment shall issue from any court against such person in respect of any such act.”, the attempt to give life-time immunity from criminal proceedings for acts done during and even prior to assuming office, of the president, the governor and additionally the prime minister, did not materialise., foreign jurisdictions, in japan, prime minister kakuei tanaka (july 1972 to december 1974) was found guilty of bribery and sentenced. in israel, prime minister ehud olmert was indicted in corruption scandals in august 2009. in italy, prime minister silvio berlusconi enacted, through a pliant legislature, a law by which he shielded himself from prosecution. the italian constitutional court recently invalidated crucial parts of that law, which may result in his trial being revived., the following are some of the main arguments against bringing the prime minister under the lokpal's scrutiny. the first one runs thus: “the simple answer is, if the prime minister is covered under ordinary law (the prevention of corruption act), you don't need him covered under lokpal.” this is a view that has been attributed to the former chief justice of india, j.s. verma (hindustan times, june 27, 2011). any misconduct by a prime minister can be investigated by the central bureau of investigation: this view is that of chief minister jayalalithaa (the hindu, june 28, 2011). this objection concedes the principle that the prime minister is not immune from criminal liability and can be investigated, but argues and assumes that the prevention of corruption act and the cbi present effective existing alternative procedures. nothing could be farther from the truth and the ground realities., what is the ground reality? first, the cbi, the premier anti-corruption investigative agency, is under the department of personnel and training, which is controlled by the prime minister's office (pmo). secondly, the career prospects of cbi officers and other personnel are dependent on the political executive, and all officers are subject to transfer except the director. thus, the investigative arm is controlled by the ‘political suspects' themselves. thirdly, the single directive, a secret administrative directive that was invalidated by the supreme court in the jain hawala case in 1997 (vineet narain v. union of india) has been legislatively revived. consequently, under section 6a of the delhi special police establishment act, the cbi is disabled from starting an inquiry or investigation against joint secretary or higher level bureaucrats without the central government's prior approval. therefore, the prevention of corruption act is a non-starter against ministers and high-level bureaucrats who may act in concert. it is imperative that the cbi's anti-corruption wing be brought under the lokpal and not under the pmo. this alone would meet the test of an independent and fearless investigative agency as enunciated by justice krishna iyer., secondly, it is argued that if the prime minister is within its ambit, the lokpal could be used by foreign powers to destabilise the government. today, the checks on the executive government are the higher judiciary, which has actively intervened in the 2g spectrum scam and other scams; the cag, whose reports against the functioning of the telecommunications sector triggered investigations into scams; the election commission headed by the chief election commissioner, which conducted elections in west bengal in the most efficient and orderly fashion. all these authorities could be undermined by a foreign power. why should the lokpal alone be the target of a foreign power? why not the intelligence and defence services? why not leaks from cabinet ministers and their offices — bugged or not?, thirdly, it is argued that bringing the prime minister under the lokpal's scrutiny would mean a parallel government being put in place. this objection is disingenuous. do the supreme court and the higher judiciary constitute a parallel government? is the cag a parallel government? is the cec a parallel government? is the cbi a parallel government? the answer is clear. these constitute checks and restraints on the political executive and the administration so that public funds are not misappropriated and constitutional democracy and citizen rights are not subverted. the lokpal will be under the constitution and subject to judicial review, and it is imperative that the anti-corruption wing of the cbi be brought under the lokpal. there is no question of any parallel government. the lokpal will be only a check on the corrupt activities of the executive. if all checks and balances are to be regarded as the marks of a parallel government and therefore abolished, it will be a recipe for dictatorship.",0.013229206069011895,lokpal bill prime minister,"new delhi , 14/06/2011 : prime minister manmohan singh ceremonial reception borut pahor , prime minister republic slovenia rashtrapati bhavan new delhi. photo : v.v.krishnan &#124; photo credit : v_v_krishnan , indian citizenry arms corruption highest levels government. anna hazare ' movement caught people ' imagination. former president , a.p.j. abdul kalam , pitched called upon youth start mass movement corruption banner “what give ?

2011-07-14,2g case accused charge cbi with delaying trial,"the accused in 2g spectrum scam on thursday charged the central bureau of investigation in a court in new delhi with delaying the proceedings for framing of charges for frustrating their chance of securing bail., the accused, including former telecom minister a. raja, dravida munnetra kazhagam mp kanimozhi and top corporate honchos, alleged that the cbi was filing additional documents to delay the proceedings required for starting arguments on framing of charges for which the special court has already asked the parties to complete the scrutiny of documents expeditiously., the advocates for the accused raised objections to the cbi’s move and the proceedings in the 2g case witnessed for the first time, trading of charges between the accused and prosecutors., the agency, the accused said, has not only “concealed the documents” and “wilfully abstained” from filing them with their charge sheets but “they (cbi) are not prepared to go for the trial because they have not completed their investigation”., “even in the supreme court, they have said that they are going to file another charge sheet. how do i know if it has anything against these 17 accused,” advocate vijay agarwal, appearing for swan telecom promoter shahid usman blawa, submitted before special cbi judge o.p. saini., accusing the agency of concealing documents, the counsel said, “if any of the collected additional document was with the cbi before the filing of the charge sheet and now if it turns out in our favour, it would go on to show that the charge sheet was filed to defeat our statutory right to bail.”, while denying bail to ms. kanimozhi, the supreme court had said she could approach the trial court after framing of charges in the case., the cbi, however, countered the allegations by the defence counsel saying at the time of filing of the charge sheets, they have already told the court that they would file additional documents in connection with the case., public prosecutor a.k. singh, appearing for the cbi, said that the subsequent charge sheets in the case have “no connection with the charges levelled in the last two charge sheets” and the probe with regard to the allegations against the accused is complete., the cbi has named 14 persons and three companies as accused in the case., “investigation as far as the same pertains to allegations contained in the instant charge sheets is complete,” he said., mr. aggarwal alleged the cbi filed incomplete documents to defeat the effort of the accused to get bail., he also argued since a charge sheet is the opinion of the investigating officer on the basis of documents and witnesses it has during the probe, the io should give his opinion in the light of new documents and statements., to this, cbi said, “we are not adding any accused or any new penal section or offence. so, there is no need to form an opinion by the io now.”, he also objected to the cbi using the statement of vinod goenka’s wife aseela goenka who has been listed as additional prosecution witness by the investigating agency., counsel for surender pipara said the cbi should show why the documents in its possession were not brought on record earlier., “on the one hand, the court asks me to speed up the entire process and now the cbi is trying to bring in new documents. how do you expect us to argue on charges when the cbi is not stating that the investigation with regard to these 14 accused is complete?”, the authorised representative of unitech wireless also opposed the

2011-08-21,i'd rather not be anna,"new delhi, 29/04/2011: novelists arundhati roy at the public convention against corruption at constitution club in new delhi on friday. april 29, 2011. photo: shiv kumar pushpakar. | photo credit: shiv kumar pushpakar , if what we're watching on tv is indeed a revolution, then it has to be one of the more embarrassing and unintelligible ones of recent times. for now, whatever questions you may have about the jan lokpal bill, here are the answers you're likely to get: tick the box — (a) vande mataram (b) bharat mata ki jai (c) india is anna, anna is india (d) jai hind., for completely different reasons, and in completely different ways, you could say that the maoists and the jan lokpal bill have one thing in common — they both seek the overthrow of the indian state. one working from the bottom up, by means of an armed struggle, waged by a largely adivasi army, made up of the poorest of the poor. the other, from the top down, by means of a bloodless gandhian coup, led by a freshly minted saint, and an army of largely urban, and certainly better off people. (in this one, the government collaborates by doing everything it possibly can to overthrow itself.), in april 2011, a few days into anna hazare's first “fast unto death,” searching for some way of distracting attention from the massive corruption scams which had battered its credibility, the government invited team anna, the brand name chosen by this “civil society” group, to be part of a joint drafting committee for a new anti-corruption law. a few months down the line it abandoned that effort and tabled its own bill in parliament, a bill so flawed that it was impossible to take seriously., then, on august 16th, the morning of his second “fast unto death,” before he had begun his fast or committed any legal offence, anna hazare was arrested and jailed. the struggle for the implementation of the jan lokpal bill now coalesced into a struggle for the right to protest, the struggle for democracy itself. within hours of this ‘second freedom struggle,' anna was released. cannily, he refused to leave prison, but remained in tihar jail as an honoured guest, where he began a fast, demanding the right to fast in a public place. for three days, while crowds and television vans gathered outside, members of team anna whizzed in and out of the high security prison, carrying out his video messages, to be broadcast on national tv on all channels. (which other person would be granted this luxury?) meanwhile 250 employees of the municipal commission of delhi, 15 trucks, and six earth movers worked around the clock to ready the slushy ramlila grounds for the grand weekend spectacle. now, waited upon hand and foot, watched over by chanting crowds and crane-mounted cameras, attended to by india's most expensive doctors, the third phase of anna's fast to the death has begun. “from kashmir to kanyakumari, india is one,” the tv anchors tell us., while his means may be gandhian, anna hazare's demands are certainly not. contrary to gandhiji's ideas about the decentralisation of power, the jan lokpal bill is a draconian, anti-corruption law, in which a panel of carefully chosen people will administer a giant bureaucracy, with thousands of employees, with the power to police everybody from the prime minister, the judiciary, members of parliament, and all of the bureaucracy, down to the lowest government official. the lokpal will have the powers of investigation, surveillance, and prosecution. except for the fact that it won't have its own prisons, it will function as an independent administration, meant to counter the bloated, unaccountable, corrupt one that we already have. two oligarchies, instead of just one., whether it works or not depends on how we view corruption. is corruption just a matter of legality, of financial irregularity and bribery, or is it the currency of a social transaction in an egregiously unequal society, in which power continues to be concentrated in the hands of a smaller and smaller minority? imagine, for example, a city of shopping malls, on whose streets hawking has been banned. a hawker pays the local beat cop and the man from the municipality a small bribe to break the law and sell her wares to those who cannot afford the prices in the malls. is that such a terrible thing? in future will she have to pay the lokpal representative too? does the solution to the problems faced by ordinary people lie in addressing the structural inequality, or in creating yet another power structure that people will have to defer to?, meanwhile the props and the choreography, the aggressive nationalism and flag waving of anna's revolution are all borrowed, from the anti-reservation protests, the world-cup victory parade, and the celebration of the nuclear tests. they signal to us that if we do not support the fast, we are not ‘true indians.' the 24-hour channels have decided that there is no other news in the country worth reporting., ‘the fast' of course doesn't mean irom sharmila's fast that has lasted for more than ten years (she's being force fed now) against the afspa, which allows soldiers in manipur to kill merely on suspicion. it does not mean the relay hunger fast that is going on right now by ten thousand villagers in koodankulam protesting against the nuclear power plant. ‘the people' does not mean the manipuris who support irom sharmila's fast. nor does it mean the thousands who are facing down armed policemen and mining mafias in jagatsinghpur, or kalinganagar, or niyamgiri, or bastar, or jaitapur. nor do we mean the victims of the bhopal gas leak, or the people displaced by dams in the narmada valley. nor do we mean the farmers in noida, or pune or haryana or elsewhere in the country, resisting the takeover of the land., ‘the people' only means the audience that has gathered to watch the spectacle of a 74-year-old man threatening to starve himself to death if his jan lokpal bill is not tabled and passed by parliament. ‘the people' are the tens of thousands who have been miraculously multiplied into millions by our tv channels, like christ multiplied the fishes and loaves to feed the hungry. “a billion voices have spoken,” we're told. “india is anna.”, who is he really, this new saint, this voice of the people? oddly enough we've heard him say nothing about things of urgent concern. nothing about the farmer's suicides in his neighbourhood, or about operation green hunt further away. nothing about singur, nandigram, lalgarh, nothing about posco, about farmer's agitations or the blight of sezs. he doesn't seem to have a view about the government's plans to deploy the indian army in the forests of central india., he does however support raj thackeray's marathi manoos xenophobia and has praised the ‘development model' of gujarat's chief minister who oversaw the 2002 pogrom against muslims. (anna withdrew that statement after a public outcry, but presumably not his admiration.), despite the din, sober journalists have gone about doing what journalists do. we now have the back-story about anna's old relationship with the rss. we have heard from mukul sharma who has studied anna's village community in ralegan siddhi, where there have been no gram panchayat or co-operative society elections in the last 25 years. we know about anna's attitude to ‘harijans': “it was mahatma gandhi's vision that every village should have one chamar, one sunar, one kumhar and so on. they should all do their work according to their role and occupation, and in this way, a village will be self-dependant. this is what we are practicing in ralegan siddhi.” is it surprising that members of team anna have also been associated with youth for equality, the anti-reservation (pro-“merit”) movement? the campaign is being handled by people who run a clutch of generously funded ngos whose donors include coca-cola and the lehman brothers. kabir, run by arvind kejriwal and manish sisodia, key figures in team anna, has received $400,000 from the ford foundation in the last three years. among contributors to the india against corruption campaign there are indian companies and foundations that own aluminum plants, build ports and sezs, and run real estate businesses and are closely connected to politicians who run financial empires that run into thousands of crores of rupees. some of them are currently being investigated for corruption and other crimes. why are they all so enthusiastic?, remember the campaign for the jan lokpal bill gathered steam around the same time as embarrassing revelations by wikileaks and a series of scams, including the 2g spectrum scam, broke, in which major corporations, senior journalists, and government ministers and politicians from the congress as well as the bjp seem to have colluded in various ways as hundreds of thousands of crores of rupees were being siphoned off from the public exchequer. for the first time in years, journalist-lobbyists were disgraced and it seemed as if some major captains of corporate india could actually end up in prison. perfect timing for a people's anti-corruption agitation. or was it?, at a time when the state is withdrawing from its traditional duties and corporations and ngos are taking over government functions (water supply, electricity, transport, telecommunication, mining, health, education); at a time when the terrifying power and reach of the corporate owned media is trying to control the public imagination, one would think that these institutions — the corporations, the media, and ngos — would be included in the jurisdiction of a lokpal bill. instead, the proposed bill leaves them out completely., now, by shouting louder than everyone else, by pushing a campaign that is hammering away at the theme of evil politicians and government corruption, they have very cleverly let themselves off the hook. worse, by demonising only the government they have built themselves a pulpit from which to call for the further withdrawal of the state from the public sphere and for a second round of reforms — more privatisation, more access to public infrastructure and india's natural resources. it may not be long before corporate corruption is made legal and renamed a lobbying fee.",0.028658220864103218,' rather anna,"new delhi , 29/04/2011 : novelists arundhati roy public convention corruption constitution club new delhi friday. april 29 , 2011. photo : shiv kumar pushpakar. &#124; photo credit : shiv kumar pushpakar , ' watching tv indeed revolution , one embarrassing unintelligible ones recent times. , whatever questions may jan lokpal bill , answers ' likely get : tick box — ( ) vande mataram ( b ) bharat mata ki jai ( c ) india anna , anna india ( ) jai hind. , completely different reasons , completely different ways , could say maoists jan lokpal bill one thing common — seek overthrow indian state. one working bottom , means armed struggle , waged largely adivasi army , made poorest poor. , top , means bloodless gandhian coup , led freshly minted saint , army largely urban , certainly better people.

2011-09-22,"will cbi investigate finance ministry note, asks brinda karat","cpi(m) polit bureau member brinda karat has demanded to know if the central bureau of investigations (cbi) would include in its investigation the office memorandum from the finance ministry to the prime minister’s office showing that home minister p. chidambaram had, while holding charge of finance, played an active role in deciding the price of 2g spectrum in 2008., inaugurating the new state committee office of the all india democratic women’s association (aidwa) here on thursday, ms. karat pointed out that the letter had not been letter by any of the opposition leaders or the left parties, but the second most important minister in the united progressive alliance (upa) cabinet after prime minister manmohan singh. the office memorandum from the finance ministry clearly showed that there was a conspiracy involved in deciding the 2g spectrum price and that the government owed an explanation to the people about mr. chidambaram’s real role in the 2g spectrum scam, she said., the cpi(m) leader said that the argument that benefits of economic growth under the new policy regime would percolate from the top to the lower layers of society, being propounded by the advocates of neo-liberalism, was more suited to explain the manner in which corruption was spreading top-down under the upa government. like the river that gets polluted all along its course once the source is polluted, the entire system of governance under the upa was getting corrupted from the very source of power, she added., coming down heavily on the planning commission’s position that rs. 26 constituted adequate private daily individual expenditure on food, education and health in the rural areas, mr. karat asked the prime minister, who is also chairman of the planning commission, to clarify what was the justification for this finding. the planning commission had arrived such a conclusion at a time prices were shooting through the roof, the latest trigger being the hike in petrol price, the situation was likely to turn worse the government takes away the subsidy on cooking gas. the left was of the firm view that the government should revive the administered pricing mechanism in respect of petroleum products, she said.",0.09347041847041848,"cbi investigate finance ministry note , asks brinda karat","cpi( ) polit bureau member brinda karat demanded know central bureau investigations ( cbi ) would include investigation office memorandum finance ministry prime minister ’ office showing home minister p. chidambaram , holding charge finance , played active role deciding price 2g spectrum 2008. , inaugurating new state committee office india democratic women ’ association ( aidwa ) thursday , ms. karat pointed letter letter opposition leaders left parties , second important minister united progressive alliance ( upa ) cabinet prime minister manmohan singh. office memorandum finance ministry clearly showed conspiracy involved deciding 2g spectrum price government owed explanation people mr. chidambaram ’ real role 2g spectrum scam , said. , cpi( ) leader said argument benefits economic growth new policy regime would percolate top lower layers society , propounded advocates neo-liberalism , suited explain manner corruption spreading top-down upa government. like river gets polluted along course source polluted , entire system governance upa getting corrupted source power , added. , coming heavily planning commission ’ position rs. 26 constituted adequate private daily individual expenditure food , education health rural areas , mr. karat asked prime minister , also chairman planning commission , clarify justification finding. planning commission arrived conclusion time prices shooting roof , latest trigger hike petrol price , situation likely turn worse government takes away subsidy cooking gas. left firm view government revive administered pricing mechanism respect petroleum products , said .","{'bjp': 0, 'cong': 0}",0,0
2011-10-04,the indulgence which turned gas into gold,"before 2g was kg: the cag has said “irregularities” in ril’s operation of the kg basin d-6 block gasfield have led to an as yet unquantified loss to the public exchequer. in this file photo from 2008, reliancechief mukesh ambani greets senior pmo officials m.k. narayanan, now the governor of west bengal, andt.k.a. nair, as murli deora, who was union minister for petroleum and natural gas, looks on. photo: rajeev bhatt | photo credit: rajeev bhatt , the dust has not even settled on the 2g spectrum scam and the manmohan singh government has been hit by another storm: the report of the comptroller and auditor general (cag) on irregularities committed in the offshore kg basin d-6 block to favour the mukesh ambani-owned reliance industries limited. parliamentarian tapan sen — a rajya sabha member from the communist party of india (marxist) — has been demanding a probe into the kg project for the past six years. the final cag report has corroborated many of the issues mr. sen had raised with the petroleum ministry as well as with the prime minister and his office. a member of parliament's standing committee on petroleum and natural gas, he spoke to sujay mehdudia on the alleged regularities, the indifferent attitude of the prime minister and pmo, and the nexus between ril and the upa government in gas exploration in the kg basin. excerpts from the interview:, with the cag's final report out, should the government launch a full-fledged investigation into the kg basin operations of ril?, an investigation should have been ordered long back. the cag has only confirmed the issues raised by me during the past six years. the upa government has been in denial mode on corruption in the kg basin d-6 block. it is dragging its feet and does not want to take on a private contractor who has indulged in unjust drainage of the national exchequer. right from the issue of gold plating to raising the gas price irrationally and abnormally, everything has been done to satisfy the private contractor. now the circle is complete. gold-plating was done to get a bigger profit in whichever manner possible. allowing gold-plating at the beginning and then hiking the gas price to almost what had been demanded by the private contractor indicated a nexus at the highest level. despite repeated pleas, the government has been indifferent to the issue. i have read in the media that the cbi is looking into the issue but till something concrete happens or it emerges from the cbi that they have launched investigations into the matter, i would not like to believe reports that a probe is actually happening., what is the most important aspect of this issue that needs to be probed?, the matter is linked to energy, which is very important and a lifeline for the people and the country. the whole issue relates to fuel, and national interest was not taken on priority. this issue has brought out the holes in the system and questions the integrity of the whole system of governance. the irregularities in kg basin d-6 block need to be probed on top priority., what was being done was so visible right from day-one. it all began with the submission of the field development plan (fdp) by ril. the initial fdp was for production of 40 mmscmd million metric standard cubic metres per day of gas at a cost of $2.47 billion. subsequently, the fdp was amended and the production target was raised to 80 mmscmd but the fdp went up four times to a whopping $8.84 billion. the whole fdp was approved by the director-general of hydrocarbons, v.k. sibal, who is facing cbi investigations now, in 33 days flat. how could such a big cost escalation be approved in just 33 days, that too when doubts had been raised inside and outside parliament?, do you think that the $4.2-per-mmbtu price fixed by the empowered group of ministers in 2007 was unjustified keeping in mind that international gas prices had been declining?, unfortunately, the whole governance is captivated by the corporates today. the government went ahead and approved the gas price almost in toto — to what was suggested by ril. a slight difference was made to say that they had not accepted what ril suggested. there was another impropriety done. ril, which quoted $4.3 per mmbtu to the egom, quoted $2.34 per mmbtu in the international competitive bidding tender of ntpc. they would not have quoted $2.34 per mmbtu without keeping a profit margin. the same ril is on record in the supreme court on an affidavit that their basic cost of exploring gas is much less than $2 per mmbtu. the committee of secretaries had opposed the gas price being fixed at $4.2 per mmbtu. the power and fertilizer minister had opposed that price. all this was given in writing to the egom headed by pranab mukherjee, that ntpc would be losing rs.24,000 crore on two projects — gandhar and kawas — if the $4.2 price was accepted instead of the tender price of $2.34. but the egom went ahead and approved a higher price shamelessly. i think the gold-plating issue needs to be probed thoroughly, but also the issue of gas price fixing. the truth should be brought out before the people who have been burdened and made to shell out more to benefit a private contractor. at that point of time, too, i had asked the government to explain on what basis ril fixed the price of $4.3. the egom, just to posture and fool the people, agreed to $4.2., how do you see the role of the prime minister and the pmo in this whole matter?, without being too uncharitable, i can say the role of the pmo and the prime minister has been indulgent. it is not something post facto as the prime minister has been claiming in various cases. the issue was pointed out by me way back in 2006. the matter was raised in parliament. every fact was put in the public domain, in writing, but no action was taken for some strange reason. the cag and its report came on the scene much later. i cannot but point the finger at the prime minister in this whole affair, and not single out the petroleum ministry as they do not have the power to do such a big thing. like a. raja cannot be singled out in the 2g scam, one man cannot be singled out. others cannot just wash their hands off in the present system of governance. in 2007, i wrote to the prime minister pointing out the irregularities. i wrote that i am not satisfied with the petroleum ministry's presentation made to me. i wrote four or five times. only once was it acknowledged., what do you make of the sudden fall in production of gas from

2011-11-25,reversal of a dangerous trend,"new delhi 02/04/2011: cbi personals carrying one of the trunk with 80,0000 page charge sheet in the 2g spectrum case against former union information and technology minister a.raja and 8 others at patalia house court,in new delhi on april 02,2011. photo:sandeep saxena | photo credit: sandeep_saxena , the issue of bail is one of liberty, justice, public safety and burden of the public treasury, all of which insist that a developed jurisprudence of bail is integral to a socially sensitized judicial process. — justice v.r. krishna iyer, in the gudikanti narasimhulu case (1977)., the supreme court's order directing the release of five of the accused in the 2g spectrum scam case, and reiterating the fundamental principles that should govern the grant or denial of bail to accused in a criminal case, did not come a day too soon. it is a shot in the arm for those fighting for greater rationale and less arbitrariness in judicial orders. it serves as a warning to the high courts and the lower judiciary that they should not be swayed by mere popular sentiment while granting or denying bail to those charged with criminal offences. the pronouncement re-establishes the sacred principle that ‘bail is the norm, and jail is an exception' as laid down by justice v.r. krishna iyer decades ago. he, at 97, must be the happiest man to endorse the refreshing order of november 23, 2011 by justice g.s. singhvi and justice h.l. dattu., yes, popular sentiment across india was initially intensely against those involved in the 2g scam. the reaction bordered on jubilation when bail applications in the case were repeatedly rejected by courts. many right-thinking people were, however, a tad uneasy while this was happening. they did not speak up because they could be easily mistaken for endorsing corruption in public life., but then, a point was reached very soon when some sections of the public were beginning to wonder whether we were all being reasonable and objective in rejoicing over the continued incarceration of the number of the accused, including a woman mp. a sense of vindictiveness seemed to have replaced compassion and fair play., unfortunately, i strongly believe that the media did not play the moderating role it should have, in striking a balance between the need to send the harshest signal to those who had grievously strayed from probity and the time tested tenet of english jurisprudence that no man (or woman) is guilty unless he or she is proved guilty. my conjecture is that this growing body of opinion that the lower judiciary was being cussed in the matter has not played an insignificant role in the two respected supreme court judges reversing a dangerous trend of incarcerating persons longer than is justified and sometimes beyond the term they would serve if eventually convicted., rustamji's role, i cannot but recall here the major role played in the 1980s by k.f. rustamji, father of the present border security force (bsf) and member of the dharma vira-led national police commission (1977-81), in bringing to national attention the scandal of a large number of under trial prisoners who were languishing for years in bihar jails. this sent shock waves among many opinion leaders in society and the higher judiciary, and there was a certain judicial enlightenment that gave relief to many from arbitrary orders of detention even after charge sheets had been laid., the latest supreme court order highlights how the law on bails should be regulated. it confirms that the primary objective of the criminal justice system should be to ensure that no person accused of a crime is released from jail if there is even the slightest fear that he would make himself scarce upon coming out, thereby paralysing the trial. the next judicial concern should be that an accused person who is bailed out is not in a position to tamper with the evidence that has already been collected and possibly presented to court. also relevant in my view is an evaluation of the prospects of such a person using his influence or standing to intimidate or subvert an accused who was likely to depose against him. if fear on neither count is present, a judge ought to tilt the scale in favour of the accused., the gravity of the offence(s) committed by an accused may certainly not be ignored as an input into a bail decision. for instance, if a person is charged with serial rapes or repeated attacks on several members of society and, therefore, shows an unmistakable proclivity to violence, the judge could not be expected to be lenient and unleash him on unwary members of society by granting bail. but when the offence is one involving a white collar crime, physical danger to society at large is seldom conceivable., the supreme court has rightly taken umbrage at a lower court's homily, after dismissing a bail application in the 2g case, on the enormity of the scam and the outrage it had caused to honest members of the public. this particular judge had possibly overstepped propriety in using language that showed a certain lack of balance. this was a case of judicial zeal getting the better of a sense of objectivity and propriety. mind you, this is, by all accounts, one of our finest trial judges. if he had been found a little wanting in compassion, what to speak of his lesser brethren? i am convinced that justice singhvi and justice dattu have sent the right signal to everyone in the system that there is need for caution in using language against those arraigned before the system. this is why one often hears complaints from defence counsel that their clients were being subjected to trial by the media. i know from my own experience that the judiciary at all levels is extremely wary of the media, and has said time and again that judges should be circumspect and remain unswayed by what appears on the tv screen or in print. it has also come down heavily on police officers and public prosecutors going to the media too often in pursuit of cheap publicity. in sum, the supreme court desires that the enormity of an offence and the attendant hype in the media should not decide the fate of a bail application., frustratingly long time, a final point referred to by the two judges relates to the frustratingly long time taken by the system to conclude a trial. efforts to speed up trials have been of little avail, except in a few sensational cases of rape in rajasthan and elsewhere. in a number of cases, including the infamous sukhram case, it is the accused who have been responsible for halting a trial at several points during the progress of court proceedings. needless adjournments and appeals based on trivial points to higher forums, also contribute to avoidable delays. but when this is not the case, and when a trial is prolonged because of the large number of witnesses to be examined and equally numerous documents to be obtained and cited, an accused person should not be subjected to the penalty of unnecessary detention without bail. this is what the supreme court judges have said in this case., the 2g scam trial involves a mind-boggling number of witnesses and documents and will definitely be a prolonged affair. the relief offered to the accused now by the supreme court cannot therefore be frowned upon., lessons from the ruling, the lessons from the singhvi-dattu ruling are not only for the lower judiciary. the investigating agencies also need to learn and modify their culture. opposing a bail application mechanically and for form's sake has become the order of the day. this is not always because of cussedness. very often, it is the product of a fear that if a bail plea is not opposed, the message that would go round would be that the investigating officer has been somehow compromised. it is this apprehension that he would be accused of dishonesty that persuades many an officer to opt for the safe option of countering a bail application with unsustainable and incorrect facts. this will not change unless courts repose greater faith in the honesty of an investigator., there is also a role for the public prosecutor who is, legally speaking, an officer of the court and not the police or any other investigating agency. it is essential that he makes an independent assessment of the pros and cons and assists the court in formulating a reasonable decision. if this does not happen uniformly across the nation, there are bound to be aberrations at the level of the lower judiciary and investigating agencies.",0.0858551132149263,reversal dangerous trend,"new delhi 02/04/2011 : cbi personals carrying one trunk 80,0000 page charge sheet 2g spectrum case former union information technology minister

2011-12-31,telecom sector still at the crossroads,"union minister of communications and information technology kapil sibal. , soon after taking charge from his predecessor a. raja (now in jail in the 2g spectrum scam case), telecom minister kapil sibal on january 1 last year came out with his ‘100-day' agenda, promising major policy initiatives for the troubled telecom sector. but even after one year, the telecom sector it still standing at the crossroads., pointing towards lacunae in the national telecom policy for the massive spectrum scam in 2008, mr. sibal had promised a ‘clear and transparent regime' to address all issues plaguing the sector. though the department of telecommunications (dot) has come out with the draft telecom policy, its main contours that would shape the industry's future are still not clear., the most controversial issue being one-time charge for the spectrum that old operators have been possessing. the national telecom policy is likely to be announced in mid-2012., how the things will shape up for the telecom sector in 2012 has been spelt out in the draft policy which says that there will be new licensing norms, exit policy for operators, while sharing and trading of spectrum, and mergers and acquisitions will be allowed., similarly, spectrum will help government generate more revenue in a transparent manner. but how will the dot address the growing need for more spectrum is still unclear even as its efforts to get radio waves vacated from defence forces have failed so far., mr. sibal had pinned major hopes on the launch of 3g services to improve sentiments in the market, which has failed to take off in a big way. but the biggest twist has been the differences between operators and the dot over intra-circle roaming, the issue which is now in court., the government also continues to struggle while dealing with security-related issues. though the blackberry issue has taken the backseat for now, monitoring of social networking websites and internet content has put the government in the dock. similarly, no major progress has been made on the issue of electromagnetic radiation from growing number of towers and skyrocketing sales of mobile handsets. notably, all these were major priorities of the dot in 2011., however, on two fronts — introduction of mobile number portability (mnp) and check on unsolicited telemarketing calls — the dot has delivered., while the new policy talks about expansion of mnp from circle to pan-india level, it also promises to end national roaming that would make calls cheaper. but mr. sibal will have to focus on pesky sms being generated from the internet., in 2012, apart from coming out with a strong and effective new telecom policy with futuristic goals, mr. sibal will have to take measures to instil confidence in the telecom sector, besides bringing in more foreign investments. proliferation of broadband is a major task in hand, streamlining the functioning of loss-making bharat sanchar nigam ltd., which includes bringing in the voluntary retirement scheme for its three-lakh employees and a public issue to improve the financial health of the telecom psu,

2012-10-06,sharing the best and the worst: the indian news media in a global context,"if i were to seek pride in india now it would in a tiny way be part of my pride; if therewere to be disappointment and regret i must now sharethat regret, and in some oblique way accept its responsibility…only now, after twenty-five years of knowing india, can i make the presumption of claiming a small share of its rare joys and its frequent sorrows., -- james cameron, foreword to an indian summer: a personal experience of india,macmillan, london, 1974, page 5., james cameron, i think, would have got it right – i mean about the indian news media as well. i doubt they were part of his pride when he came upon their front ranks, with their wildly speculative ways, during his first visit to india in 1946, a time whenthe transfer of power and, in the grim background, the partition of india were being negotiated. a quarter century later, he was still not impressed with india’s newspapers, not to mention all india radio; he found the tightly controlled broadcast network preoccupied with ‘the machinery of government as distinct from the realities of democracy’ and, like the newspapers, not showing ‘the slightest knowledge of nor interest in the affairs of other places’ (cameron 1974: 58). heknewsome ‘thoughtful and intelligent men, journalists in their own right (as is evident from the work they do outside)’ – there were few women in indian journalism at the time – but these thinking journalists were ‘enmeshed in a dismal machine, which grows worse every year’ (ibid.: 58). he was shocked by the reporting of the story of the birth of bangladesh as an independent nation, when ‘all newspaper professionalism fell to bits’ and readers were served not verifiable reports from the actual scene of the happenings, but ‘half-baked hemingway in an orgy of wish-fulfilment because, one sadly supposed, this was the indian line’ (ibid.:174-175). but cameron, fair-minded as ever, entered this caveat: his longstanding friends, ‘the core of serious and concerned indian journalists’, were even more depressed than he was by this ‘jejune amateurism’ (ibid.:175)., cameron never condescended; he judged from high standards. this self-taught journalist – reporter, broadcaster, occasional illustrator and cartoonist, foreign correspondent – took pride in communicating clearly, precisely, and meaningfully. he wrote like an angel when in flow, with descriptive richness, shiningly honest value judgments, and what he called attitude embellishing his ‘art of omission’ (to borrow a phrase from robert louis stevenson)., cameron, the generous-spirited foreign correspondent, who saw history being shaped before his eyes in vietnam, korea, india, cyprus, kenya, the congo, and elsewhere, had many interesting things to say about journalism as it was and as it should be. for one thing, he understood it to be ‘a trade, or a calling that can be practised in many ways’; he was clear it was ‘not and never has been a profession…since its practice has neither standards nor sanctions’ (cameron 1967: 69).i think the leveson inquiry should be interested in that insight from half a century ago, not much seems to have changed about the essential nature of the trade or calling since then., by the time cameron was in his middle thirties, a famous writer and broadcaster, he had formed strikingly original opinions about the craft and art of being a foreign correspondent. when he started out as a reporter, he had decided that ‘facts must never get in the way of the truth’, as he provocatively put it in an indian summer(cameron 1974: 147).his reputation as a foreign correspondent was made by persisting with this approach., he was clear that ‘objectivity was of less importance than the truth’ and ‘the reporter whose technique was informed by no opinion lacked a very serious dimension’. journalists therefore were professionally obliged to present their ‘attitude as vigorously and persuasively’ as they could, to be set out for consideration, criticism, and debate. being scrupulous and consistent about this he held to be a vital ingredient of ‘moral independence’; among other things, this involved an ‘attitude of mind that will challenge and criticize automatically, thus to destroy or weaken the built-in advantages of all propaganda and special pleading – including the journalist’s own’ (cameron 1967: 72-73)., cameron’s was an unconventional position. but it was well reasoned, intellectually honest, philosophically grounded, and nuanced – and professionally not difficult to grasp for any ‘thinking journalist’ (ibid.: 72), as he pointed out. you will not find this way of thinking about reporting in the elements of journalism and i doubt attitude and voice are,or can be, taught in journalism schools, although they can certainly be recognized,encouraged, and rewarded. self-deprecation, which can be mistaken for cynicism, came naturally to the very scottish cameron who, as though this were not enough, had been through a variant of french school education in brittany.but to the extent his positioninvolves theorizing, it is free not just from cant but also from its polar opposite, the studied cynicism that is an element of journalism in many countries, including britain., it was this highly original attitudeand voice that he brought to india as a foreign correspondent in the 1940s and later as a son-in-law of india (as we say), after he married moni, my friend, who is here with us today with her husband, sir denis forman. cameronloved the country with its enormous diversity and its ‘warm and generous’ people – and was its most consistent and empathetic critic among all the foreign correspondents who have covered ‘its rare joys and frequent sorrows’ over the years. he was a friend of jawaharlal nehru, india’s first prime minister, whom he rated as ‘incomparably the greatest man i ever met…and a big influence in my life’ in a 1975 guardian piece (cameron 1981: 309). but there was no question of cronyism for this journalist,who did not hesitate to criticize nehru severely for letting himself, his nation, and his people down., james cameron was incapable of compromising what he believed to be the truth unfolding before his eyes.he never surrendered his thinking journalist’s attitude and voice, his capacity for admiration as well as outrage, his moral independence; and not even lord beaverbrook could get one past his apparently nonchalant guard. you can read cameron, to learn about his life in journalism, in point of departure, or about his tough love for india, in an indian summer, written after a terrible, life-changing road accident that probably shortened his life eventually. for sheer literary pleasure, you can go to the best of cameron, a selection brought out by new english library in 1981 that should find a place in the library of every good journalism school in the world but is unfortunately out of print., i believe this great friend of india would have been spot on about the joys and sorrows of the contemporary indian news media. i imagine he would have found his ‘pride’ on the one hand and his ‘disappointment and regret’ on the other to be in some kind of rough equivalence., a mixed report, cut to 2012. i recently asked mark magnier, south asia bureau chief of the los angeles times, how he viewed india’s print media. here is his response (magnier 2012), which i think speaks to that kind of balance:, ‘there’s a real vibrancy (and profitability) in india’s print media that stands in marked contrast to the often depressive atmosphere we’re seeing in the west. this can be very uplifting, a reflection of india’s general outlook and stage of development, its strong economic growth, upward mobility, social possibility and heady embrace of wealth and bling, i.e. the early days of a growth story (before aging, economic maturity and other problems set in)., ‘that said, in my view this enthusiasm and energizing sense of possibility is not yet necessarily matched by the quality of the journalism. many organizations seem to rely on inexpensive, young talent that, revolving door fashion, leaves after a few years, in organizations relatively uninterested in building institutional experience or the professional standards that come out of the careful nurturing of promising journalists over many years., ‘in an aside, i learned this soon after i moved to india and followed a story on the front-page of one of the english-language dailies about an angry village god outside delhi supposedly killing off residents every 17 days over a several-month period. when i got to the village, in fact the time gap between deaths was fairly random, as you would find with any population, and the main point of the story in error. there was no appreciable fact checking and no attempt to correct it, however, a valuable lesson., ‘of course these are generalizations, and there are reporters and organizations that work very hard and do great work, but i believe the industry could benefit from a bit more focus on fundamentals.’ , this then is the topic i have chosen, in consultation with my hosts, for the james cameron memorial lecture i am honoured to give at city university london today. my theme is how india’s newspapers, news television, state-controlled radio, and nascent digital media share the best and the worst of traits and practices that we witness round the world – as journalism struggles to come to terms with profoundly changed and changing circumstances that have destabilized the game, whatever spin one chooses to put on it., key issues and challenges, let me flag some of the key issues and challenges, after disclosing that i have addressed them in papers and essays i have published over the years and especially in a talk to the contemporary history section of the last indian history congress (ram 2011), and draw from that bit of research and reflection here., the first issue is the need critically to reflect on, and rethink, the implications of the buoyant growth story. it is a well-worn narrative that draws heavily on the differences in the situation of the news media in developed countries (‘mature media markets’) and some major developing countries (‘emerging media markets’).i won’t bother you too much with the statistics; they are readily available elsewhere. what they reveal is that ‘india is one of the few places on earth where newspapers still thrive’, as ken auletta puts it in an article in the new yorker (auletta 2012), and plenty of professional opportunities are available for journalists, especially young journalists., the indian press, especially indian-language newspapers, and satellite news television continue to be in growth mode. some of that story has been splendidly researched, analyzed, and told by my friend, the political scientist robin jeffrey in his book, india’s newspaper revolution, published more than a decade ago (jeffrey 2000) and a series of articles in the economic & political weekly (1987, 1993, 1997).the key factors behind india’s newspaper revolution, jeffrey points out, are improved technology, steadily expanding literacy, better purchasing power, aggressive publishing, and, last but not least, political excitement (jeffrey 1993: 2007). there is a huge appetite out there for news and what masquerades as news, for analysis, for comment, and of course for entertainment and also for that hybrid creature, ‘infotainment’. all this has spawned tens of influential indian language daily newspapers, many of them with large circulations and huge readership. today half this total readership of about 352 million is in small towns and rural areas and women account for a third of the readership (irs 2011, q2; irs 2012, q2)., but the buoyancy and implications of this print media development, while ‘uplifting’ when viewed against ‘the often depressive atmosphere’ seen in the west, must not be romanticized. the social reach of the indian press is not impressive – about 85 copies of daily newspapers per 1000 in the population, a statistic that fares dismally in any kind of international comparison. this means, among other things, vastly uneven dispersion among regions and states, between urban and rural india, between men and women, and among social classes. such poor social reach and the extreme disparities obviously influence and distort news and editorial coverage of happenings in society., the audience for television in india is huge, in the region of 563 million (irs 2012, q2), and still growing. however, that is largely for the entertainment channels. the dozens of 24 x 7 satellite television news channels that compete with the print media in english and the various indian languages account for only about 10 per cent of the total tv market, which means they are decidedly not the dominant ‘organism’ in the indian news media ‘ecosystem’ that they sometimes claim to be. there are also signs that the long-expected shakeout is beginning to happen in the news television sector., there are other reasons why the buoyancy of the indian news media should not be exaggerated. for newspapers, the huge circulation numbers ride on the back of extreme under-pricing of cover prices and the printing and dumping of hundreds of thousands of copies that go straight to the raddhi or used paper market for recycling. the latter, a sharp practice to inflate circulation for advertising gain, has become systemic. as though this were not enough, the television audience measurement (tam) system has come under widespread criticism and even frontal attack. ndtv, a pioneer in news television in india, recently filed a suit in new york to recover about $ 1 billion from nielsen and wpp, the world’s largest communication services group, who jointly own tam in india. the suit alleges, among other things, gross negligence, false representations, prima facie tort, and corruption in the ratings system., what is now clear is that the economics of both the print and broadcast sector has been hardening, gradually. the advertising market has tightened in the last few years. the catalyst seems to be the global economic slowdown: it has taken its toll of the indian media growth story, leading some industry experts to rule out any return to the pre-crisis situation, especially in the crucial matter of advertising revenues., and how does india fare in the digital age paradox? let me first try and define this paradox, which is central to this transformational age. on the one hand, more and more people are reading newspapers digitally; you have for the first time in history a live global audience for the best publications; there are excellent newspaper and news websites offering rich, many-sided, multi-media content, including long-form features, investigative articles and thoughtful analysis; there are even success stories, here and there, of journalism garnering impressive digital revenues; the sky seems to be the limit to what you can offer in this exciting space. on the other hand, the existential crisis of the old news media has not been resolved and it continues to take a heavy toll; the discussions of the ‘future of journalism’ have not ceased; and poor morale and low spirits continue to haunt the journalistic profession as well as the news media industry – for the simple reason that all this wonderful development has not yet yielded a viable revenue and business model for internet or digital journalism., the newspaper industry continues to face ‘a double squeeze’: the print business continues heavily to subsidize digital journalism, which cannot pay for itself by attracting enough advertising or subscriptions or a mixture of the two; and the new digital players put increasing pressure on newspaper circulation, readership, and the business itself (ram 2011: 3). broadcast television faces the same problem, in somewhat different ways and measure. i rely on the judgment of john naughton and other experts that this ‘dominant organism’ in the ‘media ecosystem’ is in ‘inexorable decline’ (naughton 2006), with commercial television, in parallel with printed newspapers, ‘losing its audience, its advertising revenue, and its reporting resources’ (downie & schudson 2009)., there can be little doubt that within this digital age paradox, both the print and broadcast media in india continue to benefit from the country’s relative backwardness in internet use and broadband access – and from the digital divides that stand out. china’s development in this respect has been quite spectacular: at the end of june 2012, it had an estimated 538 million internet users (cnnic july 2012), most of them served by broadband, minimally defined by western standards. india, by contrast, has only something like 121 million internet users (internet world stats 2012), most of them poorly served by bandwidth. one would think the number would be much higher, given the country’s fairly advanced capabilities in the software field. but this is typical of india’s political economy paradox, large swathes of backwardness amidst relatively high economic growth rates. the most revealing indicator in the comparison is the internet’s penetration of the comparable populations: china’s 40 per cent, which is still only about half the developed country norm, contrasts sharply with india’s 10 per cent., what this means is that the impact of the digital revolution on the print press and on news television is considerably stronger in china than in india – and that the tipping point is likely to arrive sooner in the former. it also means that while virtually every indian newspaper has a website and some major ones offer informative and attractive digital content to readers in india and abroad, this is secondary to print content by a long chalk. my friend alan rusbridger, editor of the guardian, was recently quoted as saying that ‘journalism is changing at the speed of light’ (that is, nearly 300,000 km per second) and that ‘virtually every week we are learning new techniques and fresh truths about the way digital technologies are transforming the media’ (rusbridger 2012). within the indian newspaper industry, there seems to be a sense that the field is changing at the speed of sound (which is 342.29 metres per second)., this situation has bred complacency, so there is no real push to learn these new techniques and fresh truths that are so vital to the digital age. according to jacob mathew, the first indian president of wan-ifra, ‘some studies predict that, by 2040, the indian print industry would meet the fate of the american print media industry’ but by then indian media publishers should be in a position to ‘get a good share of the advertising revenue’ (mathew 2011). ). it seems to me that such predictions and the assumptions behind them reflect a widespread attitude of denial of the proximity, if not the immediacy, of the digital impact. the just-released top line findings of the indian readership survey (irs 2012, q2) show that newspaper readership has remained virtually stagnant over the past six months compared with a 35 per cent growth of internet users, of course from a very low base. it seems highly improbable that india has until 2040 for the tipping point to arrive., the critical challenge here is the need to come to terms with the convergences observed worldwide, make nuanced assessments of the pace of change, and prepare for the future, including possibly hard times., a conceptual framework, in critically assessing performance a clear distinction needs to be drawn and maintained between the state or fortunes of the news media and the state of journalism. the point seems obvious enough but the two states tend to get conflated in public as well media marketing discourse. high growth rates, with animal spirits rampant across the sector, may offer opportunities but they do not guarantee quality. i would now like to turn our focuson the state of journalism in india and some relevance and quality issues. to do this, one needs a conceptual framework to look at and evaluate news media functions in society. i have written on this subject and will only offer some shorthand observations here., the long-term indian press experience, set in a broader framework, suggests two extremely valuable central functions or roles that the country’s best newspapers have played in modern and contemporary times. these functions may be termed (a) the credible-informational and (b) the critical-investigative-adversarial. an accompanying condition – which evolves over time, typically as an outcome of a democratic or working people's struggle – is that the political system, for whatever reason, gives newspapers free or relatively free rein, and a public culture of valuing these functions develops. performed over time, the two central functions working together build trust in the press, or more accurately, in individual newspapers., there are also valuable derivatives of the two central, twinned functions. the first derivative is the agency of the press in public education. a second is serving as a critical forum for analysis, disputation, and comment, in which different opinions and ideas are discussed, debated, and have it out. an idealized conception of this is attributed to the american playwright arthur miller: ‘a good newspaper, i suppose, is a nation talking to itself’ (miller 1961). a third derivative is agenda building. socially conscious media can trigger agenda-building processes to help produce democratic and progressive outcomes; and this they can do best when an authentic public opinion and a congenial context of attitude, feeling, and critical democratic values and practice exist., a third function of the news media is the pastime or entertainment function. at its worst, it seeks to purvey escapist entertainment, celebrity worship, vapid talk shows, scandal, and even voyeurism at the expense of everything else. but it can be something quite different – engaging, entertaining, delving into life’s small pleasures, covering hobbies and recreation, pandering to crossword and sudoku addicts, mixing in humour and satire, lightening solemn, heavy, ponderous journalism, and in general serving the ‘pleasure principle’ as the french use that term., evaluating performance: the good and the bad, what can we say broadly about the performance of india’s news media within this evaluative framework?, the indian press is more than two centuries old. it has always been a highly political press. its strengths have largely been shaped by its historical experience and, in particular, by its association with the freedom struggle as well as movements for social emancipation, reform, and amelioration.the long struggle for independence; the sharp ideological and political divides; controversies and battles over social reform; radical and revolutionary aspirations and movements; compromising as well as fighting tendencies; and the competition between self-serving and public service visions of journalism –these have all found reflection in the character and performance of the indian press over the truly long term(ram 2000: 242).even in the pre-independence context, the press learned to act like a player in the major league political and socio-economic arena, despite its well-known limitations in terms of reach in society, financial viability, professional training, and entrepreneurial and management capabilities.this rich history accounts for the seriousness, relevance, and public-spirited orientation of the press at its best (ibid.: 242-243)., the tradition of a strong and assertive political press has continued into six decades of independence. today satellite television competes with newspapers aggressively and often breathlessly in trying to influence the political agenda of states and the nation. with their expanded reach, these news media together serve as an effective antidote to any trends of de-politicization in society. further, there is significant space for the expression of dissent and contrary political opinions., pluralism in the indian media can be said to reflect the vast regional, linguistic, socio-economic, and cultural heterogeneity of the subcontinent.a positive factor for both the print media and news television is that over the past quarter-century, their social representativeness has broadened. for one thing, there has been a rapid feminization of the newsroom. alongside this, the composition of the journalistic workforce has become more inclusive in socio-economic and regional terms. however, the number of dalit journalists in the mainstream news media continues to be insignificant., tens of millions of indians are voracious consumers of news about politics. daily newspapers in nearly two dozen indian languages as well as in english are their primary source, with news television spicing up the fare. and clearly political awareness and excitement are good for the media business. jeffrey speaks of the ‘crimean war effect’ and makes the connection strongly: while literacy, basic communications, and adequate technology are a necessary condition for the development of a daily newspaper culture, it is ‘momentous events’ that provide ‘the link between these developments and politics – the link that seems to send circulations shooting upwards’ (jeffrey 1987: 608)., the progressive south indian state of kerala is the classic indian case of politicization spreading to large sections of the population, rural as well as urban, and creating a newspaper-reading culture; and the mass habit, in town and country, of reading daily and periodical newspapers and tracking major happenings through them contributing to the creation of an authentic public opinion (ramachandran 1996: 206)., the dramatic expansion of the hindi daily press over the last quarter-century, partly in response to the political and social upheaval generated by ayodhya-centred communal mobilization by the hindu right, is a strikingly different case. the hindi press has still not been able to live down the ignominy of the kar sevak,or militant hindu chauvinist, role a large section of it played during the ayodhya crisis of october-november 1990; this has been well documented and indicted in a study commissioned by the press council of india (1991). the culpability of influential sections of the indian media in adopting a respectful, if not celebratory, attitude towards the hindu right’s ram janmabhoomi movement and in creating the impression that the mobilisation that led up to the demolition of the babri masjid was ‘a grand mobilisation without any dissenting voice’ has been criticised by the citizens’ tribunal on ayodhya (1993)., in the case of gujarat’s anti-muslim pogrom of 2002, there was strikingly different coverage by the english language and the gujarati press. while `national media’ coverage has justly been applauded for truth-telling and blowing the whistle on a state-sanctioned genocidal pogrom, it was a sobering fact that the dominant gujarati print media in the state performed the manufacture of consent function with a vengeance, attracting censure from various fact-finding exercises, including a report done for the editor’s guild of india (2002), for ‘wilful incitement to offence, propagation of hate, and fuelling disorder’., some of the finest work done by the indian press, historically and in contemporary times, is its investigation and expose of political corruption, ministerial misconduct, and government misdeeds. in fact, corruption, in its myriad forms and tremendous scale, presents limitless investigative opportunities to india’s independent news media; it also enables them continuously to win strong public support for the work they do. here is james cameron (cameron 1974: 139) on the phenomenon, as of 1974 when its scale was perhaps a thousandth of what it is reckoned to be today:, corruption in india is almost as leaden a cliche as hunger. it is sanctified by the oldest of traditions: it is denied by nobody, indeed the totality and pervasiveness of indian corruption is almost a matter of national pride: just as india's droughts are the driest, her famines the most cruel, her over-population the most uncontrollable, so are all the aspects of indian corruption and bribery the most wholly spread and spectacular., given such exciting opportunities to investigate independently, build on investigations done by official watchdog bodies, and do agenda building on the theme of corruption, the press has done itself proud. the bofors howitzer deal scandal captured the imagination of political india in the late-1980s, so much so that bofors became a synonym for sleaze and skulduggery in various indian languages. the opening shot in this case was fired by a well-informed broadcast over swedish public radio, which then, curiously, went silent over the affair. the prolonged investigation and document-backed expose of the scandal by the hindu, in which i played a part, is generally reckoned to have contributed to the downfall of a corrupt government. bofors featured arbitrary and opaque decision-making on a major military acquisition, and contractual arrangements to pay bribes aggregating more than $200 million as the quid pro quo for the indian government’s purchase of the 155 mm swedish howitzers in preference to french howitzers that the indian army brass had repeatedly rated as a better buy. about $50 million of this amount was paid into secret swiss bank accounts before the whistle was blown on the corrupt deal., in the years since, there might have been no repeat of bofors and the way it unravelled. but in the last few years, the press and news television have aggressively probed, and agitated on, a series of corruption scandals that have shaken political india and eroded the credibility of the manmohan singh government., this is the man booker prize-giving season and we have quite an exciting shortlist of contenders. by the way, i haven’t read all the books on the shortlist but i can’t imagine how hillary mantel won’t do it again. anyway, here is my shortlist of india’s choicest corruption scandals., the 2g-spectrum scam is about the government twisting the rules under a ‘first come, first served’ (rather than an auction-based) allocation regime to favour mobile telephony companies through undercharging 2-g spectrum allocation licences in return for huge kickbacks. the presumptive loss to the government has been estimated by the comptroller and auditor general of india (cag), a constitutionally created financial watchdog, to be in the region of us$32 billion but most of the bribes are yet to be traced by the criminal investigations., the scandal around the 2010 commonwealth games held in new delhi featured massive irregularities such as the award of work contracts at very high prices, often to ineligible parties, and pervasive corruption in procurement and the award of contracts for the construction of the game venues., the adarsh housing society scam in mumbai, india’s financial capital, involved top politicians, officials, and military officers subverting rules to have a massive high-rise constructed at a prime location and corner flats for themselves at hugely deflated prices., the mining scandal, spread across several states, has featured the illegal and corrupt mining of ore, especially iron ore meant for export, defrauding the state of mining revenues through ministerial and official collusion, encroachment on forest land, and trampling on the rights of tribal folk., the coal block allocation scandal, or coalgate, promises to be the biggest of them all – and perhaps one day someone who fictionalizes it will be in contention for a booker. the cag has exposed the fact that by going for a process of arbitrary allocations, or patronage deals, instead of competitive bidding, the central government has enabled a ‘windfall gain’ for the allottees worth us$ 35 billion., in all these cases, the irregularities and suspicious transactions were exposed by constitutionally or statutorily created authorities. but the role of the news media has been crucial in keeping up the heat, contributing new information or angles, and following up –thus helping to build a democratic public agenda on the theme of political corruption., i must add a caveat here. critics have noted, correctly, that the energy and motivation indian newspapers have shown in going after government and political corruption have been missing in investigating and exposing corporate corruption. the reasons for this i will go into a little later., the publication in early 2011 of a series of articles based on the u.s. embassy cables on india, made available by wikileaks, provided the reading public and historians of contemporary india a wealth of information on foreign and domestic policy issues, and on corruption, the cover-up of corruption, and ministerial and official misconduct. one cable supplied explosive information on the 2008 ‘cash-for-votes’ scandal, where parliamentary votes were sought to be bought to help the manmohan singh government squeak through a no-confidence motion in the lok sabha, india’s house of commons. hearteningly, publication of the story in the press triggered the launch of a criminal investigation under the watch of the supreme court of india., i have given you an idea of the democratic role played by influential sections of the indian news media in the sphere of politics. unfortunately, when it comes to economic issues and policies, the mainstream media’s contribution turns out to be anything but democratic. this was not always the case. amartya sen has commended the historical role of indian newspapers in exposing hunger-related facts on the ground in extreme cases and, in concert with other democratic institutions, preventing the government from pursuing disastrous policies and thus guaranteeing ‘the avoidance of acute starvation and famine’ (sen 1985a: 77)., today a number of factors operating in the indian media industry have virtually shut out news, analysis, and comment that challenge the neo-liberal economic policies that have held sway over the last two decades. mainstream press and broadcast media coverage has tended to adopt a laudatory tone, keep out or underplay the criticisms and objections, censor the negative political and socio-economic effects, especially among the poor, and provide little space to the voices of robust criticism and opposition, including those raised from the ranks of professional economists., critics point out that indian journalism is facing increasing pressure from advertisers, marketing personnel, corporate managers, and even senior journalists to present and prioritize ‘feel good’ factors – rather than highlight the reality of mass deprivations and what to do about them. in several frank conversations with the executives of india’s largest newspaper publishing company, auletta learnt why poverty, especially rural poverty, was not a fit subject for news and editorial coverage, why this coverage had to cater to the ‘aspirational’ among young readers (because poverty was ‘not a condition to which one aspires’), and whya newspaper’s editorial philosophy, which was derived from its business philosophy, had to be one of optimism (auletta 2012)., but the problem, which is by no means confined to one or a few news organizations, goes way beyond this. in an original and unusually perceptive meditation on ‘markets, morals and the media’, the economist prabhat patnaik (2002) addressed an interesting conundrum. despite the growing reach of the media in society, and despite the talent they have been able to attract, ‘the power of the media as an institution’ has ‘gone down greatly in india’ in recent times., the key question is: why has this decline in the power of the media occurred? patnaik’s answer is that ‘internal’ or media-centric explanations are inadequate and that a better explanation is that‘the moral universe of the people’ has undergone a change, engendering ‘a degree of confusion, uncertainty, and fuzziness’ about what is right and wrong and enabling communal or corrupt forces to ‘get away with their unconcern for media and intellectual opinion’. looking deeper for an explanation, the economist finds it in such factors as the collapse of dreams of building a society that is not based on private aggrandizement, the ascendancy of a new kind of international finance capital based on the globalization of finance, the spinelessness of nation states and political formation in the face of this ascendancy, the intellectual hegemony attained by ideas and policies imposed by globalized finance, and the plethora of institutions and instruments that serve this juggernaut (ibid.)., there can be little question that the news media ‘have fallen prey to this hegemony’. from this, we come to what may be called patnaik’s law on media power in relation to economic issues: ‘where the media are on the same side as international finance capital, they appear powerful; but in fields where they strike out on their own, upholding humane values and expressing concern for the poor and the suffering, they appear powerless’. such powerlessness, he proposes, is the outcome of a process, ‘the process of ascendancy of international financial capital over the economy, which the media, paradoxically, with a few honourable exceptions, have avidly supported’ (ibid.). george monbiot in a recent guardian column on the collusion between big business, neo-liberal thinktanks, and the media is on to much the same trend in the uk – how ‘to free the rich from the constraints of democracy’ (monbiot 2012)., poverty and mass deprivation, basic livelihood issues, the impact of policies on these issues, the state of agriculture and the countryside remain massively undercovered in indian newpapers and the broadcast media. the good thing is that the honourable exceptions patnaik refers to have been significant. p. sainath’s investigations of rural distress, farmers’ suicides, and mass migrations, which won him several honours, including a magsaysay award, are in the finest traditions of people-oriented, investigative, agenda-building journalism. such influential and iconic work, along with the lively contributions of young idealistic reporters on these subjects in various indian languages, suggest a way out of this bind – provided a public culture of valuing such journalism can be built up., the business of journalism, in several developed countries, media monopoly has developed in a big way, eroding diversity, pluralism, and the values of serious journalism. the situation in india is rather different, as is appropriate to a stage of media development when ageing, economic maturity, and the problems of maturity have not yet set in (magnier 2012).but here too monopolistic tendencies and aggressive market practices aimed at aggrandizing market share and killing competition have manifested themselves in the press and, to an extent, in the news television sector. there is clear evidence of hyper-commercialization, which takes a heavy toll of journalism., auletta’s new yorker piece, citizens jain (auletta 2012), offers an entertaining glimpse of an exotic world of aggressive and unorthodox publishing and business strategizing for growing newspapers that throws out of the window most of the things we have learnt from journalism school or the elements of journalism., the issue of ‘paid news’ exploded in the public sphere in the aftermath of the 2009 general election. a section of the press revealed that a large number of newspapers, small, medium-sized, and big, and also several television channels had sold promotional news packages of specified size, using an under-the-table rate card, to candidates in state assembly and parliamentary elections. candidates who could not pay, or refused to pay, were blotted out of news coverage. there were special rates for negative coverage of the candidates’ opponents. this involved violations of the law, was tantamount to extortion in several cases, and mocked every rule of ethical journalism. it was every bit of a rogue practice as the uk’s phone hacking affair was. the scandal of paid news led to a damning report by a sub-committee of the press council and calls for external regulation of the press and the private television channels., it also led to some critical debate on a wider phenomenon – paid news not as a rogue practice but as a deeper and industry-wide phenomenon that was not confined to election coverage. sainath offers this handy definition: ‘paid news is run to pass off an advertisement, a piece of propaganda and advertisement...pass that as news, pretend that it is news, that is “paid news”. paid news does not disclose to the reader that this information has been paid for’ (sainath 2010)., to return to the theme of hyper-commercialization and what it means for journalism. auletta’s top media interlocutors had no inhibitions in telling him that ‘we arenot in the newspaper business, we are in the advertising business…a derived business...of aggregating a quality audience’ for advertisers to ‘facilitate consumption’ (auletta 2012: 53, 55). and they had a point, considering that in this top thriving newspaper league, 80 to 90 per cent of the revenues come from advertising and only small change from circulation. he learnt about focus-group-led research that put ‘elitist’ editors, ‘pompous fellows thundering from the pulpit, speaking in eighty-word sentences’ (ibid.:55),in their place. this was research directed by the marketing people into what readers, and especially ‘aspirational’ young readers, wanted to read and the consequent restructuring and re-invention of editorial content., auletta was educated in easy rationalizations of the practice of ‘advertorials’ – an ad-sales initiative that opened a section of the newspaper to promotional or puff pieces paid for by celebrities, brands, and well-heeled ego-tripsters, and written not by ad agencies but by the newspaper’s reporters. there was some kind of indication that this section was paid for but a reader needed ‘a magnifying glass to be alerted’ to the disclosure in small print (ibid.: 53)., the new yorker writer, who has written its annals of communications column since 1993, also learnt about another business innovation originating from india’s largest newspaper-publishing company but now fairly common in the media industry –‘private treaties’, a programme under which newspapers offer ads to smaller and medium-size companies in exchange for equity (ibid.: 54). the conflict-of-interest implications of this initiative for editorial coverage of these companies by the newspapers have been much discussed among journalists and critics of the indian media industry. they even attracted the attention of the securities and exchange board of india (sebi); in a 2009 letter to the press council chairman, it warned that ‘private treaties may lead to commercialization of news reports since the same would be based on the subscription and advertising agreement entered into between the media group and the company. biased and imbalanced reporting may lead to inaccurate perceptions of the companies which are the beneficiaries of such private treaties’ (sainath 2010)., this brings me back to the point that the two states – the fortunes of the news industry and the state of journalism – ought not to be conflated. manipulation of news, analysis, and comment to suit the owners’ financial or political interests; the downgrading and devaluing of editorial functions and content in some leading newspaper and news television organizations; systematic dumbing down, led by the nose by certain types of market research; the growing willingness within newspapers and news channels to tailor the editorial product to subserve advertising and marketing goals set by owners and senior management personnel; hyper-commercialization; price wars and aggressive practices in the home bases of other newspapers to overwhelm and kill competition; advertorials where the paid-for aspect of the news-like content is not properly disclosed or disclosed at all; private treaties; rogue practices like paid election campaign news and bribe-taking for favourable coverage. if this is what it takes to have thriving newspapers and other news media, then there is something seriously wrong with this growth path., actually, some of these tendencies, which have grown qualitatively worse over the past decade, go back in time. they have caused anxiety to two press commissions, to the press council of india from time to time, and to a host of practitioners in the field. the issue has been sharpened and highlighted recently by trenchant and tireless public criticism of the ways of the press from the chairman of the press council, markandey katju. the retired supreme court judge, who came with strong credentials as a champion of free speech on the bench, began his term in late-2011 by highlighting ‘three major defects in the indian media’. he listed them as frequently diverting attention from serious socio-economic issues to non-issues and trivializing news, dividing the people by putting out communal or other divisive messages, and promoting superstition and obscurantism instead of rational and scientific ideas. he also criticized what he considered to be the relatively low intellectual level of a majority of journalists, their poor general and domain knowledge, and their lack of ‘desire to serve the public interest’. he called on the indian media, print as well as broadcast, to take the progressive path the print media charted in europe’s age of enlightenment. he revealed that he had written to the prime minister suggesting that the press council act be amended to bring the broadcast media under the purview of the council and also that it be given ‘more teeth’, including penalizing powers (katju 2011a). not everybody agrees with these bold generalizations and sweeping assertions but, in my opinion, the katju critique has been valuable for keeping the focus on relevance and quality issues., how free?, an overarching issue for the news media in india is the state of free speech., article 19(1)(a) of the indian constitution guarantees freedom of speech and expression as a fundamental right. this right, hard won in the freedom struggle against a highly repressive and censorious british raj, is unamendable. freedom of the press is not explicitly mentioned by the constitution but the supreme court of india has, through judicial interpretation, read it into article 19. it has held that freedom of the press is a combination of two freedoms – article 19(1)(a), ‘the freedom of speech and expression’, and article 19(1)(g), ‘the freedom to practice any profession, or to carry on any occupation, trade or business’. the first is clearly the principal component., unfortunately, freedom of speech and expression is hemmed in, and to a significant extent undone, by article 19(2). this provides for restrictions on the fundamental rightby law – some reasonable, most not. notable among the unreasonable restrictions that remain on the statute book or in practice are the law of criminal defamation, the undefined power of contempt of court, uncodified legislative privilege, the outrageous law of sedition(124a of the indian penal code), other illiberal provisions of the ipc (especially 153a), the unlawful activities (prevention) act, and other draconian laws enacted in the name of fighting extremism and terrorism., further, media freedom in india is considered ‘incomplete’ because the print media and the broadcast media have not been placed on an equal constitutional and legal footing (ravi 2007). the higher courts have not judged it necessary to confer article 19(1)(a) protection on radio and television., newspapers in independent india have functioned under a legal regime of registration; since there is no licensing, they cannot be de-licensed. by contrast, private satellite television channels and fm radio stations function under a licensing system and can be taken off the air for alleged serious transgressions of the rules laid down by the ministry of information and broadcasting. paradoxically, while newspapers have the press council, a statutorily established watchdog, some would say a watchdog without teeth, there is no legal regulatory framework for private satellite television channels, which have attracted growing public complaint that they are a law unto themselves. add to this the fact that the huge terrestrial television network remains a state monopoly and the private fm radio stations are not allowed to do news and current affairs, which remain the monopoly of all india radio, and you have an idea of how complicated it gets., free speech has come under serious pressure in india. consider these examples from the past quarter-century., being the first country in the world to ban salman rushdie’s satanic verses and carrying through this policy of appeasement of murderous intolerance to the last jaipur literary festival., criminalizing paintings by india’s greatest painter, m.f. husain, from 1996 onwards, the state standing by asan orchestrated hindu right campaign intimidated him with dozens of criminal complaints filed across the country, vandalized his art works and exhibitions, and eventually forced him into exile in dubai, to die, at the age of 95, in london as a qatari national., carrying out several acts of localized violence and intimidation against journalists, writers, historians, cartoonists, artists, activists, and others., assaulting journalists and sending toughs to stone, smash, and burn the offices of media organizations, here and there., piling on criminal defamation cases against journalists, with the lower courts hardly applying their mind to prima facie admissibility even under this illiberal law, thus ensuring that the process is the punishment., blocking text or sms services in the name of law and order or public order. notifying under the information technology act, 2000 (as amended in 2008) illiberal rules, especially the notorious intermediary guidelines rules, which permit blocking of content on the internet., threatening to tame the social media, which, among other things, shows a complete inability to understand the nature and ways of the sharing beast., using the sedition law against the writer arundhati roy., imprisoning a cartoonist for sedition, with the result that the indian criminal justice system has itself become a cartoon gone viral on the worldwide web., as the journalist salil tripathi put it earlier this year in a tweet at the freespeechdebate site: ‘biggest threat: combination of state passivity, antiquated laws, and existence of ‘the right to feel offended’’ (tripathi 2012). the right to be easily offended – genuinely offended or offended for the sake of an ideological or political cause – he might have added, had twitter allowed him more than 140 characters., this paradoxical situation demands well-considered, progressive reform. the aim of such reform must be to expand the scope of media freedom – but also to ensure professional and social accountability. but it is well to remember that media freedom cannot survive, let alone thrive, unless free speech can be safeguarded in society at large., regulate? if so, how and by whom?, this is a period during which, taking the cue from the critique and demands placed on the national agenda by press council chairman katju, many voices within the indian establishment and the large media-consuming public are demanding accountability, transparency, better standards, an end to paid news and other rogue practices, and effective governance and regulation. the more discerning critical voices make the point that ‘self-regulation’ either does not exist within the indian media industry or, where it exists, is not effective. self-regulation, the press council chairman has proclaimed, is an oxymoron and no profession can be called a profession unless it has an enforceable code of conduct and sanctions against those who violate it. so what can be the answer?, it is likely that freedom of the indian news media will come under increasing pressure and threat unless they move briskly to set their house in order. they need to ensure that transparency, accountability, and social responsibility are more than slogans. with no codes of values or practice binding journalists and the media industry, and no mechanisms for self-regulation such as internal news ombudsmen in place within major news organizations other than one or two, the vulnerability to government and legislative forays in disciplining the news media through external regulation going beyond the present press council is becoming increasingly evident. over the years, a substantial international literature has appeared on templates for socially and ethically accountable journalism and also on the constitutive ‘elements of journalism’ (kovach & rosenstiel 2001). this has yielded codes of practice or professional ethics privileging the principles and values of journalism. it has emphasized such disciplines as fact-checking, verification, investigation, rigorous data sourcing and analysis, providing context and meaning, and maintaining perspective., here a fundamental question arises: what are facts to the journalist? the new york times may continue to print on its front page the claim, ‘all the news that’s fit to print’, patented in 1896, but everyone recognizes this is mythologizing about not just one newspaper but about the field of journalism itself. some months ago, i proposed to the contemporary history section of the indian history congress that an intelligent approach to the journalist and her facts needed to fall back not so much on c.p. scott’s much-quoted dictum, ‘comment is free but facts are sacred’ (scott 1921), as on e.h. carr’s classic dissection of ‘the historian and his facts’ (carr 1961: 7-30). the approach needed to steer between the scylla of a ‘fetishism’ of undistinguishable facts and documents, the most trivial mixed up with the really significant, and the charybdis of the wildest and most extreme subjective form of ‘disputable interpretation’. as for the discerning public, the most sensible advice must be, following carr (1961: 23), ‘when you read, or tune in to, a work of journalism, always listen out for the buzzing’.this is more or less what james cameron prescribed to young journalists., india and its news media can learn valuably from the parallel discussion of media-related issuestaking place in the united kingdom, which has been provoked by the rogue practices of an influential section of its media. the leveson inquiry has been a stimulating learning experience for us, allowing for the considerable differences in the situations. many of the testimonies have been first-rate and the inquiry has gone quite deep into ‘the culture, practices and ethics of the press’ (leveson inquiry 2011).as a former editor, i am pleased that the forward-looking editor of the guardian has welcomed leveson as ‘an opportunity for the industry to have a conversation with itself while also benefitting from the perspective and advice of others’ (rusbridger 2011), and that several other british journalists seem to agree with this. we look forward to the final report or recommendations of lord justice leveson and to seeing what legislative or other practical arrangements might follow., the indian situation cries out for such an independent, comprehensive, hard look into the culture, practices, and ethics of the news media and into questions of what kind of regulatory and governance mechanisms can be worked out and put in place. the object must be the same: to support ‘integrity and freedom of the press while encouraging the highest ethical standards’ (leveson inquiry 2011)., nobody knows what the long term holds for india’s news media. it should be possible, through some kind of regulation, to reform the system to put an end to the major ethical transgressions, not to mention rogue practices like paid news. but i have no illusions about what it will take to reverse the tendencies that put enormous pressure on independent, professional journalism. my personal hope is that feel-good journalism, focus-group-led journalism, ad-dictated journalism, journalism that sees no need to take account of basic realities – the mass poverty and the multiple deprivations in a country where two-thirds of the population subsist on less than two dollars a day– can be discredited by good, sensitive, progressive journalism that attracts public support. my hope is that effective incentives, moral and material, can be put in place in significant sections of the news media for taking up the basic concerns of hundreds of millions of ordinary indians – and projecting them, with social responsibility, into the public sphere., references, auletta, ken (2012), ‘citizens jain: why india’s newspaper industry is thriving’, the new yorker, october 8, pages 52-61.,

2012-11-26,ex-cag official could face breach of privilege,"former cag official r.p. singh arrives to appear before the public accounts committee in connection with the 2g spectrum scam at parliament in new delhi. file photo , opposition leaders in the joint parliamentary committee (jpc) want to call back the former cag official, r.p. singh, to explain contradictions between his media statements — that cag estimates of 2g losses are inflated — and his deposition before the jpc last year., during his deposition, mr. singh had said he didn’t disagree with the final cag report and was under no pressure to sign it. jpc members like the cpi’s gurudas dasgupta ask why mr. singh didn’t choose to add a dissenting opinion to the report then — the normal practice in government institutions — but is now publicly denouncing the rs 1.76-lakh crore loss estimate., different deposition, mr. dasgupta told the hindu that mr. singh’s public disclosures were widely different from his deposition under oath to the jpc on november 14, 2011. “r.p. singh is playing a fraud. he is subverting the jpc.”, mr. singh refused to comment when contacted., mr. singh’s position also contradicts the stand taken by jpc chairman p.c. chacko., within hours of mr. singh making startling disclosures raising questions about the credibility of the cag’s report, mr. chacko told the media on friday: “as chairman, i cannot reveal certain things now, but the fact is that director-general mr. singh has made this deposition, and the same statement was made before the jpc committee.”, in his media interviews, mr. singh said he had presented his own loss estimate of rs. 2,645 crore instead of the rs. 1.76 lakh crore. he further raised questions about public accounts committee chairman murli manohar joshi acting in an improper manner with a view to influencing the cag, a charge he later retracted on karan thapar’s show ‘the devil’s advocate.’ “i was misquoted,” he said., on the pac-related allegations made by mr. singh, mr. dasgupta said the pac in february 2010 had suo motu started an investigation into the alleged malpractices in the spectrum distribution. “when conducting the enquiry, it called officers of the finance ministry and also called the cag to assist them,” he explained, adding that the cag never shared any report with the pac since the cag report was presented to parliament much later, on november 16, 2010. mr. singh has said in the media that these meetings “can influence” the cag and pac reports., opposition leaders are also concerned that mr. singh is alluding to information he did not present before the jpc. “if a person is called to depose before a parliamentary committee and holds back information, which he subsequently discloses long after the jpc has almost completed its

2014-05-17,comprehensive win,"while it is an astounding victory for mr. narendra modi, the bharatiya janata party and the national democratic alliance, nobody could have imagined that the congress would bite the dust in this manner, with a margin that eclipsed even the wildest exit poll predictions., mr. modi has proved that he is no ordinary political leader but a strategist who has put every political challenger including regional leaders in his/her/their place. it is an electoral earthquake, especially for those who oppose mr. modi. many of us need to understand where we went wrong in our assessment of the might of this man who we seem to have misread so badly., yogeshwar davar,, new delhi, it is heartening to note that we are back to the era of single-party rule. it is time for the new government to put into action all assurances it made in its manifesto and during campaigning. the bjp needs to usher in bold reforms to energise the economy. this time round, there is no excuse to pass around of coalition dharma and errant allies. at the same time, the stunning mandate should not be misconstrued as an approval for implementing a divisive agenda., sekhar rayaprolu,, secunderabad, after a decade of coalition politics, the people of india have finally understood the price that one has to pay to move forward on development and also to get everyone on board on specific issues. another is the caste and communal card that parties have been sticking to versus agendas of governance., madhusree guha,, kolkata, while one can say that it was the better marketing strategy of mr. modi’s that propelled the bjp to power, the mandate seems to be more a reaction to the large-scale corruption unleashed by the upa, a sluggish economy and price rise. on many an occasion, the government looked ineffective. there were also many flip-flops on welfare schemes, an example being the aadhar-linking exercise., k.a. solaman,, alappuzha, projection of the prospect of single-party rule, a strong will and courage of conviction with a willingness to highlight the experiment of development in a leading state on a national platform are the ingredients of the bjp’s comprehensive win. as for the congress, it was all about corruption, confusion and chaos, paralysed governance, weak leadership, sycophants and unimpressive spokespersons. it seems to be a party with immense talent but one which never learns lessons from the past., v. rajagopal,, tirupati, one knew about the anti-incumbency wave, but never expected the scale of the congress’s defeat. in its defeat, the party’s contingent of media spokespersons have only turned out to be the great spoilers. instead of accepting wrongdoing, they are doing more damage by shielding their top brass. in the end, the clever voter spoke., mudgal venkatesh,, gulbarga, as a towering model of democracy, india has once again upheld its high standards, beliefs and the spirit of democracy. making this great feat possible, the people have given their ultimate verdict. the mandate should be read as a yearning for a paradigm change and a clean india. the thumping victory may have brought great joy in the bjp's inner circle, but it also highlights the unspoken responsibilities that need now to be shouldered., finally, one should not forget the efforts of the true musketeer, the election commission of india, and the complex logistical task it undertook. the interview, “we are into election management, we do not get into the nitty-gritty: sampath” (may 16) was enlightening., arjun r. shankar,, thiruvananthapuram, the congress party could have avoided its ignoble defeat had the upa government admitted its lapses and initiated course correction after the exposure of the 2g spectrum scam. it paid the price for its brazen defiance of public opinion., it is hoped that mr. modi will view the bjp's victory as an endorsement of his promise for decisive governance and not for divisive politics., v.n. mukundarajan,, thiruvananthapuram, mr. modi overcame all the odds of a relentless vilification campaign by an allegedly neutral (english language) media and a continuous barrage of vitriolic remarks by so-called intellectuals. edmund burke, that doyen among british parliamentarians, once said: “plain good intention which is as easily discovered at the first view as fraud is surely detected at last, is, let me say, of no mean force in the government of mankind.”, n. parthasarathy,, tiruchi, let us hope that mr. modi, who is mainly instrumental for this great victory, will do his best to make india a progressive, peaceful and prosperous country, treating all people, whatever their language, culture or religion, as one. there is no doubt that people have voted for change. the new government must stand only for “progress and prosperity” and nothing else., it is also, as leading academician zoya hasan said on television, the first time in the world that a right-wing government has been given such a massive mandate. in such a situation, there needs to be a strong and secular opposition., v.m. khaleelur rahman,, chennai, with the bjp/nda all set to come to power after the huge show of support and belief from the people of the country, it is time for it/them to rise to the occasion and start acting on what has been promised. among other economic and political issues that need to be addressed is the issue of violence along communal lines, rampant in assam’s bodoland area. this is something that the upa failed to address in 2012. if the bjp deals with the northeastern region in a sensible and firm manner once and for all, it would stand to gain among the people there, which has always been a sort of congress bastion. more than 20 years of

2015-05-30,caged parrots and the steel frame,"was pradip baijal's revelations on 2g spectrum scam too little, too late? , the former telecom regulatory authority of india (trai) chairman pradip baijal’s interesting account of his years in the indian administrative service (ias) raises, among other things, several crucial issues in public administration. of course his book, the complete story of indian reforms: 2g, power & private enterprise — a practitioner’s diary, is better known in the media for some of its “startling revelations” about the 2g scam., in the book, he gives eloquent expression to his pent-up anguish over his maltreatment, especially the alleged unleashing of enforcement agencies against him by those who were annoyed with him for his stubborn stand on a variety of issues. i must say that he sounds credible if one goes by what has been widely reported across the media and on the debate on the state of governance in the last decade. this takes me on a brief journey into the country’s administrative history., minister-civil servant relationshipnotwithstanding tribulations and moments of despair and disappointment, an average indian civil servant, in the first few years after independence, enjoyed working in a professional ambience that would become the envy of those who followed him. for about three decades — till 1975 to be precise — things were quite hunky dory. barring a few aberrations, an honest government official could hold his head high and stick to his principles while discharging his duties, even if it meant being argumentative and difficult in the eyes of his political superiors., the emergency (1975-77) changed all that. from about this point of time, civil servants were perforce required to kow tow to people who belonged to a strikingly different genre and who enjoyed wielding their enormous authority in day-to-day administration. the earlier equilibrium in the polity gradually yielded place to strife and confrontation, and a fear psychosis started developing even among top civil servants. the healthy relationship that had existed earlier between minister and civil servant became a thing of the past. in many states honest dissent even at the highest levels such as the chief secretary and the director general of police was resented, and unquestioned obeisance alone rewarded. there has been no visible change since then in respect of ministerial authoritarianism and hubris., i do not buy the argument that this power shift is inevitable in a dynamic democracy like ours. the sharp and honest public servant should be allowed to have his say although he can be overruled by the political executive in as decorous manner as possible, instead of being targeted for imaginary charges with the aid and abetment of enforcement agencies like the central bureau of investigation (cbi) or state vigilance bureaus., the perception now is that the back of the bureaucracy has been broken and its political neutrality totally wiped out. it is heartening that a small process of recovery has begun at the centre, but it may take a long time before its impact becomes measurable., it is against this backdrop that the memoirs of a few senior civil servants, published in the recent past, including the recent one by mr. baijal will have to be viewed., not all the writing may seem distinguished or profound. in fact, mr. baijal’s book is disjointed and gives the impression of having been “assembled from different sources” — all his own — in a hurry. some allowance may also have to be given for bias and factual inaccuracy that inevitably creeps into such accounts., working in governmentone principal charge levelled against all such writers, post-retirement, is that they speak too late. this is unfair and uninformed criticism. if ever you have worked in government, you would understand how scary it is to take on a minister, especially a person who is a political heavyweight and one on whom the very survival of a government depends. the fear of reprisal lasts much longer even after one has hung up one’s boots, given the mystic power of rehabilitation that many politicians seem to possess. to criticise a senior official for taking his own time to recapitulate all that he experienced while in service is preposterous. in public discourse, it is the larger picture painted by them that should count., mr. baijal has had more than his share of highs and lows in a long innings, first as a secretary to the government of india, and later at trai. he no doubt had a few good bosses from the political firmament who valued propriety and decorum. a bright spark like mr. arun shourie believed in his ability and motivated him to be innovative and daring. as against this, there was an equal number who did not swear by principles and who did not fancy the likes of mr. baijal., leading from the frontthe gravamen of the charge that mr. baijal makes is that two successive telecom ministers pushed an agenda that negated all canons of propriety and governance. he was warned against quoting rules and procedure that had stood the test of time. he was asked to back off or else harm would come by him swiftly. one of the two worthies told him imperiously that he (the minister) was in fact the “prime minister” as far as telecommunications was concerned. we are fortunate that he did not designate himself the country’s prime minister! mr. baijal was also told in no uncertain terms that he should sever all links with the prime minister’s office (pmo) even when the latter demanded written notes from the ministry on burning issues of the day, such as allocation of 2g spectrum. so much for a constitutional government! mr. baijal laments that in all this he received no support from the pmo. actually, he was asked to sail along with the stand of the minister concerned, and not to be overly bothered about the correctness or ethics of such a stand. the issue at stake here was not the then prime minister’s own integrity, which remains untainted and unchallenged to this day. what was relevant here was his position as the primus inter pares, and an ability and willingness to control his ministers. if he chose to play safe, how could you expect a puny secretary to the minister to do anything different? this is an eternally relevant question in public administration., one may dismiss all that mr. baijal says as being a case of one man’s word against another. it is also true that such references to threats and innuendos from the highest in the country’s executive can never be proved in a court of law. this is the supreme advantage that many of our rulers enjoy.yet i am willing to give credence to the senior official’s account. in the absence of convincing material against the latter that even remotely suggests dishonesty on his part, i am inclined to believe the average civil servant., test of conductmudslinging against a civil servant who complains comes naturally to many in authority, and it is quite possible that mr. baijal is a victim of a malicious campaign. however, what causes me immense pain is mr. baijal’s accusation against the cbi. he says that the bureau was programmed to dig up dirt against him at the behest of those who were annoyed with his firm stand on 2g and related issues. there was a witch hunt against him also for his doings as a secretary in the newly formed ministry for disinvestment nearly a decade after he relinquished charge. perhaps most shocking is alleged direct advice by someone in the cbi that he could save himself if he roped in a few in the private sector who enjoyed a great reputation for following business ethics. if this were true, only the almighty can save the country from politician-driven impropriety on the part of an agency that the highest court of the land depends so heavily on for ferreting out the truth in many a scandal.",0.08473654454997741,caged parrots steel frame,"pradip

2017-12-31,"in tamil nadu, a year of troubles and churning ","youngsters stage a rail roko on the vaigai river bridge near madurai railway junction as part of the jallikattu protests, on january 21, 2017. | photo credit: r. ashok , 2017 was a momentous year for tamil nadu in many ways. if one were to trace back the trigger for this year’s events, it was probably embedded in the sunset of 2016, in the death of jayalalithaa, and the conviction and subsequent jailing of her close associate v.k. sasikala. a trail of events was to follow that would dominate not only the political space, but also have an impact on many aspects of the lives of the people of the state, not necessarily positively, in a way that has seldom happened in the past in tamil nadu. , politically, it was a witches’ cauldron. many vile things were thrown in. a rebel emerged, was joined by others, but soon, turned and embraced the system, with his followers bringing up the tail. another was turned into a rebel without any preamble. in an embittered state, a much loved symbol, the two leaves, was hotly contested with multiple factions of an erstwhile dravidian behemoth fighting over it. a byelection, rescinded once, and held the second time around, added more intrigue to the mix, sullying the waters further by widespread allegations of candidates giving out cash for votes. , the retirement of the dmk’s m. karunanidhi too, almost coinciding with the passing of jayalalithaa, left a political vacuum which chief minister edappadi k. palaniswamy tried to fill. however, a constant churning fails to leave the establishment at peace. loyalties swing from one faction to the other at the mere whiff of change of winds, the latest being the victory of sidelined aiadmk leader and sasikala’s nephew t. t. v. dinakaran in the r.k. nagar bypoll. the court verdict absolving the dmk’s former mps a. raja and kanimozhi of charges in the 2g spectrum scam is another event that is likely to have larger ramifications in the years to come., socially, this was also a year of protests, crystallising in the jallikattu sit-out on the beach in chennai. its surprising vigour, size and longevity prompted many to call it the city’s ‘arab spring.’ the protests in the delta region — kathiramangalam and neduvasal — followed, as farmers protested ongc’s exploration of wells in the region, despite the company’s claims. the other issue to snowball into protests was the neet examination qualification for admission to medical courses, specifically with the suicide of a bright young girl who lost out on a seat. 2017 will be the year the state took on the sand mafia too., severe water scarcity in the north, in chennai, and a severe cyclonic storm in the south, in kanniyakumari, both wreaked havoc in those areas. as if drama was lacking, two ships collided off the coast of chennai, allowing several tonnes of oil to spill into the bay waters. high ranking officers were named in what has now come to be called the gutkha scam, on which investigation is ongoing. add to this, raids by the income tax department across the state, the struggles post-demonetisation and gst levy, and the state’s cup overfloweth., but 2017 will probably be remembered for the way in which everything, irrespective of which sphere it occupied, was rendered entirely political, recalling what mao said, “politics is war without bloodshed.”, aiadmk interim general secretary v.k. sasikala at the jayalalithaa memorial before leaving for bengaluru, in chennai on february 15, 2017. | photo credit: k_v_srinivasan , , an ill wind , a key issue after all hell broke loose post the death of jayalalithaa was the delay in the swearing in of v.k. sasikala as chief minister by the then governor ch. vidyasagar rao, after the party’s general council elected her in february., it was a roller-coaster ride for the aiadmk during this year. its party symbol was frozen following the revolt by cm o. panneerselvam against sasikala and her family’s take-over of the party. by the time the party united and got back its symbol, mr. panneerselvam, a three-time cm, settled for the deputy cm’s post., despite several denials, allegations that the bjp-led centre and its leadership were behind the turbulence in the aiadmk continued to dog the government. to make things worse, the r.k. nagar bypoll indicated that the clout of t.t.v. dhinakaran would remain a challenge., before the dmk’s celebration over the 2g verdict was complete, the humiliating defeat in the bypoll that pushed the party to the third place has given it issues to ponder. the makkal nala kootani or the people’s welfare front, which was a platform of smaller parties and was seen as a possible third front, fell apart this year., while congress continued to fight factionalism, the bjp seems to be continuing in its efforts to build its base. the state waits as two stars of the film industry dally with politics. it was a challenging year for the election commission too which had rescinded the bypoll for r. k. nagar in april on charges of distribution of money to voters and conducted it in december. , - dennis s. jesudasan, tributes are paid to s. anitha, who ended her life dejected over not being able to get a mbbs seat, at the gandhi market in tiruchi on september 02, 2017. | photo credit: a_muralitharan , , spitting out the truth, it was a scam that triggered political outrage so much that the tamil nadu assembly was stalled for four days., the sensational gutkha scam exposed by the hindu in june this year was a startling revelation of how the banned substance was allowed to be manufactured, stored, transported and sold in the city., during a surprise raid on the premises of the gutkha manufacturer, the income tax department seized incriminating documents that blew the lid off a huge scam involving the state health minister and top officials, including some ips officers., the position of the state government that the crucial i-t report on the scam never existed was debunked by the then chief secretary ram mohana rao who confirmed that it was very much on record and that former chief minister jayalalithaa wanted to take action on those involved. the dvac is investigating the case., - s. vijay kumar, , lock, stock and barrel, for the first time in the history of chennai, over 1,000 families from 12 slum settlements along water courses and lakes were evicted from their homes of many years. while the relocation itself was painful, taking them far away from their places of work and schools, resettlement became even more tiresome with the evacuees complaining of poor infrastructure at their new housing colonies in the city’s suburbs. , - aditi r., fisherfolk express their grief after the devastation caused by cyclone ockhi. | photo credit: a_shaikmohideen , , a devastating cyclone, when cyclone ockhi hit the coast on november 30, it turned out to be the last voyage for around 250 fishermen, who had ventured into sea on november 28 hoping to return with a good catch before christmas. the losses that ockhi left in its wake ensured that christmas was neither merry nor the new year prosperous for many fishermen of kanniyakumari. , people are giving up hope of their kin returning to shore, even as the centre has reiterated that search operations will continue till the last fisherman is rescued. on the shore, there was severe damage to crops, houses and infrastructure. , - p. sudhakar., , trouble at sea, rameswaram witnessed a fierce protest by fishermen when the sri lankan navy
