2009-09-13,concern over fdi in higher education,"s. gurumurthy, convenor the swadeshi jagaran manch (sjm), has expressed concern over the move to permit foreign direct investment (fdi) in higher education, proposed by union human resource development minister kapil sibal., if the proposal were to be approved, it would pave way for the entry of foreign universities such as harvard and oxford into india, which were “unsuited to our cultural ethos”, mr. gurumurthy said at a press conference here on saturday, referring to the hindu nationalist ideology of the sjm, he said that although the manch had traditionally identified itself with anti-globalisation movement, “cultural protectionism” was central to its core beliefs. “we will oppose any move to bring in foreign universities because of the kind of education that they will provide to our students. their kind of culture is unacceptable to us,” he said., mr. gurumurthy also took exception to the foreign ownership of indian media houses. the constitution guaranteed the freedom of press only to indian citizens, he said., on the country’s economic front he said that anti-globalisation lobbyists such as him, who had been branded as “bullock-cart economists” at the height of the liberalisation regime, were proving to be right by the day, especially in the wake of the global economic crisis. “even the mighty us is promoting the “be american, buy american’ economic policy. their economic model has failed,” he said., the pursuance of neo-liberal economic policies cut across the political parties to include those that shared ideological ties with the sjm, and the larger sangh parivar. “this is a battle that must be fought by the people because political parties are unable to withstand the pressure from foreign capital,” he said.",0.05487012987012989,concern fdi higher education,"s. gurumurthy , convenor swadeshi jagaran manch ( sjm ) , expressed concern move permit foreign direct investment ( fdi ) higher education , proposed union human resource development minister kapil sibal. , proposal approved , would pave way entry foreign universities harvard oxford india , “unsuited cultural ethos ” , mr. gurumurthy said press conference saturday , referring hindu nationalist ideology sjm , said although manch traditionally identified anti-globalisation movement , “cultural protectionism ” central core beliefs. “we oppose move bring foreign universities kind education provide students. kind culture unacceptable us , ” said. , mr. gurumurthy also took exception foreign ownership indian media houses. constitution guaranteed freedom press indian citizens , said. , country ’ economic front said anti-globalisation lobbyists , branded “bullock-cart economists ” height liberalisation regime , proving right day , especially wake global economic crisis. “even mighty us promoting “be american , buy american ’ economic policy. economic model failed , ” said. , pursuance neo-liberal economic policies cut across political parties include shared ideological ties sjm , larger sangh parivar. “this battle must fought people political parties unable withstand pressure foreign capital , ” said .","{'bjp': 0, 'cong': 0}",0,0
2009-09-18,developing countries now dominate global agricultural plantation business,"unctad’s just-released “world investment report 2009: transnational corporations, agricultural production and development” reveals some fascinating shifts in the global agricultural sector. most striking: twelve of the world’s 25 leading agricultural production (plantation) firms are from developing countries. sime darby of malaysia is largest, with $10.9 billion in total assets and $4.7 billion in foreign assets in 2007. as striking, it is much larger than nos. 2 and 3 — the dole food company and fresh del monte produce of the united states, with $4.6 billion and $2.1 billion in total assets, and $2.6 billion and $1.8 billion in foreign assets, respectively. india’s karuturi global, a rose producer, with $54 million in total and $37 million in foreign assets, ranks no. 23. five of the other top 25 agricultural production firms are malaysia, and five are from indonesia, thailand, sri lanka, papua new guinea and south africa., developing country firms are also becoming significant m&a players in agricultural production. in 2008, they acquired $1.6 billion worth of plantation assets, representing 40 per cent of the total global m&a value in this vertical. developing countries are now also leading targets for global agricultural production m&as., this year’s report offers a fascinating glimpse into the world of agriculture, food and beverage, and food retail multinationals, while examining their impact on agriculture internationally. but, most valuable of all, the report presents readers with a global context within which to situate india’s own ongoing national debate on agricultural reform and retail liberalisation, as also to assess the development of its agri-business sector., fdi in agricultural production (as distinct from upstream or downstream agriculture-related industries) accounted for just 1-2 per cent of total world fdi flows and fdi stock in 2007, due to restrictive fdi policies in this sector. however, recent liberalisation has prompted annual fdi inflows to triple from $1 billion in 1990 to $3 billion in 2007. fdi inflows in the more liberal food and beverages sector have burgeoned from $7.2 billion in 1990 to $40.5 billion in 2007., despite their dominance in global agricultural production, developing country firms play a much smaller role at the top of the four other agriculture-related verticals considered by the report. the world’s 25 top agricultural suppliers and privately-owned agri-food businesses are all from developed economies. only two singapore firms, wilmar international and fraser & neave, rank among the global top 25 food and beverage firms and, that too, only near the bottom. only three developing economy firms, two from hong kong and one from kuwait, feature among the top 25 food retail chains., further, the leading firms in these verticals are gigantic. walmart, the world’s largest food retail tnc, has $163.5 billion in total assets and $63 billion in foreign assets. it is followed by nestle, the world’s largest food & beverages tnc, with $102 billion in total assets and $65 billion in foreign assets. basf and bayer of germany, the largest agricultural suppliers, each have some $70 billion in total assets. cargill and mars of the united states lead the privately-owned agri-food vertical, with $44 million and $27 million in global agri-good sales., key role for tncs, despite negligible global levels of fdi in agriculture, multinational companies do play a key role in agricultural development, the report finds, particularly in countries which actively seek foreign investment in agriculture. china is now the world’s leading agricultural fdi destination, with annual flows of $700 million and $6 billion in inward fdi stock, far ahead of the united states whose inward agricultural fdi stock is just $2.5 billion. in cambodia, laos and malaysia, agriculture draws 10-15 per cent of total national fdi inflows. multinationals account for 100 per cent of mozambique’s and zambia’s cotton production, 75 per cent of brazil’s poultry production, and 90 per cent of vietnam’s fresh milk production., contract farming is the dominant mode of engagement, since most countries prohibit land acquisition by foreigners. according to the report, agricultural production firms, food and beverage companies, and supermarket chains ‘contract farm’ crops, livestock, and bio-fuels in 110 developing and transition economies. cereals, sugarcane, fruit, oilseeds, and poultry/ meat are the primary focus of investment in asia, africa and latin america, and dairying in central and eastern europe., the report sifts through the international experience with tnc participation in agriculture to determine what value and risks it brings to host country farmers. the strongest observed impacts are much increased incomes, access to credit and investment, and links to global markets and supply chains. available data also suggests that tncs have contributed to domestic food security by boosting agricultural production, while increasingly selling the largest share of their produce locally. potential dangers are farmers’ over-reliance on a couple of monopoly buyers and commercially-viable crops, minimising their bargaining power and economic resilience. irresponsible commercial farming can also seriously damage the environment., the record on employment-generation and technology transfer is varied. while farms that plant labour-intensive crops, like tea and flowers, create thousands of jobs, those that are heavily mechanised do not. similarly, while tncs now lead the development and commercialisation of novel seed, crop protection, and other technologies, only one per cent of their r&d budgets goes towards staple crops that are important to developing countries, and intellectual property rules hamper the diffusion of existing innovations. however, they have contributed to farm modernisation and farmer capacity-building., the report suggests that developing countries might benefit from encouraging more private investment into their agricultural sectors to enhance productivity, reduce hunger, and boost farmer income and welfare. however, tnc involvement should be approached strategically, so as to minimise downsides. protective measures might include an integrated strategic policy and regulatory framework for tnc activities in agricultural production, model contracts that farmers might use when negotiating with tncs, local output-sharing requirement, and the development of international standards of transparency and fair play applicable in cases of land acquisition., more significant question, although the report concentrates on the potential impact of inward foreign participation in agriculture, its rich detail provokes another, more significant question for indian policy-makers. that is, why is india not an outward fdi player in agriculture, in keeping with bric and emerging market counterparts?, china, with $1.2 billion in outward agricultural fdi stock in 2007, is now the world’s third largest international agricultural investor after the united states and canada, and south korea, brazil, chile, and colombia also figure amongst the global top 20. ironically, india — one of the largest global agricultural producers with a strong latent international advantage — is absent from this list. largely responsible is a national agricultural policy that has focused solely on trade as the instrument for agricultural growth, overlooking the potential developmental impact that might issue from encouraging globalised indian players in agriculture. the economic contribution made by globalised indian it, telecom, and pharmaceuticals firms is unequivocal., fortunately, india has made a start in the right direction. mahindra & mahindra is now a global top 5 tractor producer, and indian r&d firms’ contributions to seed and crop research are internationally acknowledged. but india still has a long way to go, beginning with the first and most vital step of all — a mindshift in policy. — courtesy: u.n. information

2009-09-30,bharti airtel calls off merger talks with mtn,"a farmer speaks on his cell phone in the backdrop of a giant billboard of bharti airtel in roopnagar district of punjab on september 15, 2009. photo: akhilesh kumar | photo credit: akhilesh kumar , despite intense deliberations for over past four months, the merger talks between two telecom majors — bharti airtel and south africa’s mtn — were called off on wednesday after the south african government rejected the structure of the proposed deal worth $23 billion., “this structure (of the proposed deal) needed an approval from the government of south africa, which has expressed its inability to accept it in the current form. in view of this, both companies (bharti airtel and mtn) have taken the decision to disengage from discussion… we hope the south african government will review its position in the future and allow both companies an opportunity to re-engage,” bharti airtel said in a statement. this is the second time in just over a year when the merger talks between the two telecom giants had been abandoned., the main irritant was the issue of dual listing of mtn to maintain its identity in the merged company. the south african government was not only against mtn losing its identity but has also disapproved the idea of the south african telecom firm being taken over by foreign nationals. “it would be sad if we saw this entity move into the hands and management of foreign nationals. its management must remain south african,” south african communications minister siphiwe nyanda had told journalists earlier in the day at johannesburg., the deal talks, which began on may 25 and saw two extensions, envisaged creating a combined entity of $20 billion in revenues and 200 million (20-crore) subscribers globally. sunil mittal-led bharti airtel had proposed acquisition of 49 per cent shareholding in mtn, while mtn and its shareholders would have acquired about 36 per cent economic interest in bharti, of which 25 per cent would be held by mtn with the remainder held directly by mtn shareholders. airtel and mtn had signed agreement to hold exclusive talks for a deal that could include $10 billion in cash and $13 billion in shares., “the alliance planned between bharti and mtn was a vision based on solid fundamentals, which had the potential of creating an emerging markets telecom giant and the third largest telecom company in the world (behind china mobile and the vodafone group). substantial synergies could have been captured with this proposed transaction. the broad structure being discussed by the two sides had taken into account the sensibilities and sensitivities of both companies and both their countries. this transaction would have been the single largest foreign direct investment into south africa and one of the largest outbound fdis from india,” the statement said.",-0.02085193452380953,bharti airtel calls merger talks mtn,"farmer speaks cell phone backdrop giant billboard bharti airtel roopnagar district punjab september 15 , 2009. photo : akhilesh kumar &#124;

2009-10-06,brazil and the honduran crisis,"honduras' ousted president manuel zelaya shows photographs of repression against his supporters to european union congressmen jose ignacio salafranca, back right, carlos iturgaiz, left, and juan salafranca, front right, at the brazilian embassy in tegucigalpa, tuesday, oct. 6, 2009. photo: ap , things in honduras were going from bad to worse. finally, brazil decided to take the bull by the horns and exercise the sort of leadership needed to find a solution to the crisis. president luiz inacio lula da silva has indicated that deposed president manuel zelaya, who recently returned incognito to his country and made it into the brazilian embassy, can stay there “as long as it is necessary.” he also responded to the ‘ultimatum’ delivered to him by the honduran government (giving him ten days to either surrender mr. zelaya to the police or provide him with political asylum) by saying that he does not negotiate with coup mongers., brazil has received some flak for this. jorge castañeda, in a long interview in the daily o estado de sao paulo, has stated that, in so doing, brazil is acting more like a “dwarf” than a “diplomatic giant”, taking on minor battles for “a country that is not decisive.” in his view, this would hardly correspond to brazil’s aspirations to join the united nations security council as a permanent member. the former mexican foreign minister is wrong. indications are that mr. zelaya’s return and brazil’s stance have led to a turnaround in the stalemate that existed until now. talks between the de facto regime and mr. zelaya seem to be in the offing., why is honduras so critical? why is it that the fourth poorest country in latin america, with a per capita income of a mere $ 1900, about half the regional average, the one that gave rise to the term ‘banana republic,’ has turned into the most urgent matter on the inter-american agenda? why is it that, in the past half century, no other single event in the americas has been rejected as emphatically as the one that took place in honduras on june 28, 2009?, what does the suspension of this country from the organisation of american states (oas) by a unanimous vote tell us?, the instant and unanimous reaction to the honduras coup must be set against the background of what has been a long and protracted struggle to construct and consolidate democracy in latin america over the past 20 years, something on which enormous progress has been made. however, given the shallowness of these democratic roots and the enormous inequalities that mark these societies, this tender plant called democracy needs special caring and nurturing., in the age of globalisation, respect for democracy has ceased to be merely an internal matter. in an interdependent world, in which countries can obtain significant benefits from international trade, fdi and tourism, to mention only a few items, the international community also demands that, to continue to be part of this ‘club’, certain requirements are fulfilled. a large number of democratic monitoring mechanisms have thus emerged., in no part of the world have these mechanisms been as institutionalised as in latin america. the inter-american democratic charter, approved in lima, peru, on september 11, 2001, was, from a legal point of view, the culmination of this process. to that we should add the many regional and sub-regional agreements that include a democratic clause, according to which the moment the democratic continuity of any given member state is interrupted, the latter’s membership is suspended., since then, there have been cases in which elected heads of state have ended their terms prematurely and abruptly. but in none of them did we see anything similar to what happened in honduras: a president taken at gunpoint out of his home in the early hours of the morning, put on a plane, and flown abroad. if that is not a military coup, what is?, if the inter-american system is unable to restore democracy in honduras, one of the weakest countries in the region, it will not be able to do so anywhere. honduras puts into question 20 years of democratisation in latin america. what would the european union do if tomorrow there was to be a coup in, say, greece? to ask the question is to answer it. to allow the precedent of the honduras coup to stand would have serious consequences. that is why over the last three months different entities, groupings, and governments have attempted to undo the effects of the coup. these go from the members of the bolivarian alternative for the americas (alba), led by venezuela, to the oas, president oscar arias of costa rica, the united states, and now brazil. the eu, and spain in particular, have taken very clear stands on the issue., given the realities of power in the hemisphere, many expected that the leadership to solve the crisis would come from washington. however, despite its ostensible commitment to multilateralism and the cause of democracy in latin america, the administration of president barack obama has indicated that, even though it condemns the coup and has instituted sanctions, it is not prepared to take a leadership role in overcoming the current stalemate. in fact, on the occasion of the nafta summit in guadalajara on 9 august, mr. obama, with some irony, stated that it seemed odd to him that the very same people who in the past denounced yankee interventionism, were now clamouring for washington to do precisely that. the republican opposition to mr. obama in congress has also managed to paralyse u.s. policy towards latin america at this critical point by holding up key diplomatic nominations., admittedly, the united states has several carrots and sticks to make honduras return to the straight and narrow. some of them have already been used. coup regime head roberto micheletti, his foreign minister carlos lopez, and the 14 judges of the supreme court who have backed the ‘de facto’ government have had their u.s. visas revoked. mr. micheletti’s daughter, posted to the honduran embassy in washington, has been deported. partly as a result of u.s. pressure, both the world bank and the imf have suspended their loan programmes to honduras, including the $ 150 million allocated as part of the $ 250 billion global stimulus package managed by the fund., but this may be the chance for latin america to learn to use its own carrots and sticks. in the course of the past decade, latin america has started to play a more significant role in international affairs, diversifying its markets and its diplomatic links. this has gone hand in hand with a noticeable drop in u.s. influence in the region. at the same time, intraregional political cooperation has increased exponentially, with the growth and development of many new collective entities and their summits. this significant asset is now being put to the test. if latin american presidents cannot resolve this crisis, which ones can they solve? if not now, when?, a recurrent criticism of brazilian foreign policy during the lula presidency has been that it has paid too much attention to global issues (the doha round, ibsa and brics, and un security council reform) and not enough to regional affairs. now that brazil has taken seriously the task of resolving the impasse in honduras, the argument is reversed: it is that by getting involved in such a regional issue, brazil would be harming its broader aspirations. this is nonsense. brazil is the great latin american regional power and it projects its influence around the world from the region. a regional power with global aspirations that is unable to resolve crises in its own surroundings will not be taken seriously elsewhere.",0.02073115609880316,brazil honduran crisis,"honduras ' ousted president manuel zelaya shows photographs repression supporters european union congressmen jose ignacio salafranca , back right , carlos iturgaiz , left , juan salafranca , front right , brazilian embassy tegucigalpa , tuesday , oct. 6 , 2009. photo : ap , things honduras going bad worse. finally , brazil decided take bull horns exercise sort leadership needed find solution crisis. president luiz inacio lula da silva indicated deposed president manuel zelaya , recently returned incognito country made brazilian embassy , stay “as long necessary. ” also responded ‘ultimatum ’ delivered honduran government ( giving ten days either surrender mr. zelaya police provide political asylum ) saying negotiate coup mongers. , brazil received flak this. jorge castañeda , long interview daily estado de sao paulo , stated , , brazil acting like “dwarf ” “diplomatic giant ” , taking minor battles “a country decisive. ” view , would hardly correspond brazil ’ aspirations join united nations security council permanent member. former mexican foreign minister wrong. indications mr. zelaya ’ return brazil ’ stance led turnaround stalemate existed now. talks de facto regime mr. zelaya seem offing. , honduras critical ?

2009-11-09,brazil model to tax foreign capital may not work in india financial scene,"sharp reaction: a file photo of the headquarters of sao paulo's stock exchange (bovespa), brazil. , a recent decision by the brazilian government to impose a 2 per cent tax on all foreign exchange inflows has revived interest on a subject, very mention of which has been considered retrograde and impractical in some quarters in india., the subject broadly covers capital controls, which connote a restraint on inflows of foreign portfolio money rather than an outright ban. what is sought to be curbed is the huge influx of short-term capital that can flit in and out of countries at short notice. their size can be huge., in many cases, they represent money borrowed in countries such as japan having low interest rates. these ‘carry trades’, as they are called, have been one of the biggest threats to macro economic management in many countries., quite recently, the historically low interest rates in the u.s. have also fuelled such trades. emerging markets such as brazil and india have started attracting once again foreign portfolio managers, who are attracted by the higher returns they offer., at the height of the financial crisis these funds fled india and other countries. driven by extreme risk aversion they chose the safety of the u.s. and dollar denominated assets., as the global crisis slowly lifts these emerging markets are once again proving to be attractive. but their presence in these countries has not been an unmixed blessing. generally there is no objection to other forms of capital inflows., foreign direct investment (fdi) is particularly welcomed, especially when it goes into greenfield ventures. the recipient country benefits in a number of ways, including employment generation, technology transfer and so on. however, in india there are sectoral caps, which do restrict fdi in specific sectors., in india, the issue is also tied to capital account convertibility or full convertibility of the rupee. india has achieved convertibility on current account. there has also been a substantial liberalisation on capital account. but full convertibility is to be achieved only after several important signposts such as fiscal consolidation are reached., this calibrated approach has served india well. the indian economy has been resilient in the face of the global crisis., capital controls are of different types. it can be on the basis of price as in the case of brazil’s new tax. it can be in the form of ceilings or quotas. in india, there is a ceiling on foreign investment in debt instruments including government paper but none at all in the equity market., brazil’s chief concern is the debt market, although the tax covers investment in equities too., foreign inflows in large quantities may pose problems for interest rate management apart from currency appreciation., brazil like india has been receiving plenty of foreign capital. an immediate consequence has been an appreciation of its home currency, the real., since the beginning of the year until the third week of october it had appreciated by 36 per cent against the dollar. brazil’s export competitiveness has suffered in much the same way india’s has in the wake of the rupee appreciation. the rupee is now worth 47 to a dollar up from the above 50 levels last year., india and brazil have another important feature in common. both are considerably less dependent on exports than china or japan for their growth., both have a large middle-class, whose purchasing power has grown hand in hand with the size of the market. for overseas investors the large number of potential consumers is a big attraction., but is it feasible to restrict portfolio investors in india, brazil style?

2010-02-07,imf sees recovery but there are caveats,"imf managing director dominique strauss-kahn addresses the asian financial forum in hong kong last month. photo: ap , the international monetary fund in the latest update to its world economic outlook sees economic prospects across the globe improving substantially. while some of its previous reports had said that the worst of the crisis was over and that recovery was on, the latest update (january 26) points out that the recovery is much faster than anticipated., in fact, compared to its last update (october 2009), the imf has significantly marked up its forecasts for several countries and regions., global output is forecast to go up by 3.9 per cent and 4.3 per cent in 2010 and 2011, respectively, above the october forecasts of 3.1 per cent and 4.2 per cent. advanced economies too are expected to fare better than originally anticipated, with growth rates of 2.1 per cent and 2.4 per cent for 2010 and 2011, respectively. last year, these economies (as a group) contracted by 3.2 per cent. the u.s., which had a negative growth of 2.5 per cent, will post positive growth rates of 2.7 this year and 2.4 per cent in the next year., india, china lead, however, in what has by now become common knowledge, it is the developing countries led by china and india that have picked up the slack and remain in the forefront of the global recovery. according to the imf, the category “emerging markets and developing economies” will grow by 6 per cent and 6.3 per cent in 2010 and 2011. china and india lead the table with projected growth rates of 10 per cent and 7.7 per cent, respectively, in 2010 and 9.7 per cent and 7.8 per cent in 2011., the sharp recovery in these two countries has been well recognised. already many countries in the region are benefiting from china’s growth. japan’s exports have turned positive after a long slump mainly because of the demand from china. the fact that the indian economy has been on an even keel even during the worst phase of the recession and has now entered a higher growth trajectory has rekindled capital flows, both foreign direct investment (fdi) and foreign institutional investment (fii)., the imf report, while being more optimistic about global economic prospects than at any time during the past two crisis ridden years, nevertheless sounds a caution or two. advanced economies are still dependent on government stimulus measures, which obviously cannot be continued indefinitely. sooner than later, private demand must take over. the timing of the exit — when individual countries could withdraw the stimulus and other ‘anti-crisis’ measures — is best left to individual countries., in many countries, the stimulus measures cannot be withdrawn immediately. some of them risk a return to recession if such measures are withdrawn soon. there are some positive signs, to be sure., financial markets have rebounded since the lows of last march. economic conditions have improved and the wide ranging policy actions of governments have helped. risk appetite has returned and capital markets have reopened. in the u.s., consumption demand has been surprisingly strong and has contributed to the rebound in confidence. in all advanced economies, inflation is expected to be contained., challenges remain, however, policymakers still face extraordinary challenges as they seek to unwind the unprecedented fiscal, monetary and financial support they provided to keep their economies and financial markets from collapsing. high unemployment rates, rising public debt and high levels of individual indebtedness in some countries present further challenges to the recovery., due to the still fragile nature of recovery, fiscal policies should remain supportive of economic demand in the near term. fiscal stimulus planned for 2010 should be implemented in full. however, in many countries, there are growing concerns about fiscal sustainability. countries should, therefore, work towards devising strategies for exiting from the stimulus packages., financial sector reform, a crucial task ahead for policymakers in the developed countries is to repair the badly damaged financial sector. policymakers will also need to move boldly to reform the financial sector with the objectives of reducing the risks of future instability. attention should also be bestowed on how the potential fallout of financial crises would be borne in future, while at the same time making the sector more effective and

2010-02-18,india’s growth opportunity in defence,"neelu khatri, manager, defence advisory services, kpmg. , defence could be the next boom after the it (information technology) and automotive sectors, hopes wg cdr neelu khatri (retd), manager, defence advisory services, kpmg, new delhi. “the total defence spending from 2010-2016 would be to the tune of $280 billion. based on last five years’ average revenue, capital expenditure on major acquisition would translate into about $115 billion,” she mentions, during a recent telephonic interaction with business line., india’s capital acquisition includes aircrafts and aero engines, radars, artillery guns, heavy and medium vehicles, and naval vessels, interceptor boats, among others; this opportunity is to be seen as one that could benefit all stakeholders, neelu feels., “a good beginning has been made. the government of india must be appreciated for formulating the defence procurement procedure, a dynamic document that has shown incredible improvement since inception. with more impetus from the government, india could well be the next defence and aerospace manufacturing hub.”, excerpts from the interview, over the phone and email., how has the defence industry evolved since independence?, india had very little national industry after independence and most military weapons and equipment were of british make. it was after suffering a setback in the sino-indian war (1962), that the government of india took up a resolve to develop an effective production base., this was done by procuring arms from the soviet union on highly subsidised terms and creation of an infrastructure for in-house production and maintenance. the installation of ordnance factories, defence public-sector undertakings (psus) and over 40 defence research and development (r&d) laboratories bear testimony to this effort. over the years, these organisations have been aiming to achieve self-sufficiency and indigenisation of defence manufacturing in the country., the early 90s witnessed the economic reforms in india and rapid decline of support from the erstwhile ussr due to its serious politico-economic crisis. it was after this phase that there was a spurt in defence expenditure from rs 15,000 crore per annum to a massive rs 50,000 crore towards the close of the decade., the kargil episode in 1999, although a tactical victory for the country, was considered as a strategic failure. the lack of adequate and modern equipment at the battlefront exposed the state of obsolescence in the defence forces. further investigations, especially sting operations such as tehelka highlighted various scams in the defence procurement. various enquiries and reports mercilessly criticised the defence procurement methods as being time consuming, tedious and complicated., gory details of deals were brought to the public view illustrating the long, complex and arduous process that took decades before finalisation. the procedures marred the forces’ capabilities to modernise. deals such as the “hawk” advanced jet trainer (ajt) from bae of the uk had taken 22 years to finalise for acquisition. the $1.62 billion hawk purchase in march 2004 was based on air staff requirements (asr) in 1987., the group of ministers’ report on national security post kargil war faulted the then existing procedure. in 2004, the kelkar committee was constituted to suggest improvements in defence acquisitions and production. the committee pointed out that india “…should diversify its defence procurements not only to reduce dependence and prevent russia’s strategic stronghold, but also as a business strategy. this will allow for competitive bidding and better deals.”, what are the initiatives taken by the government to boost this sector?, to provide an impetus to the indigenisation plan and to introduce transparency to the hitherto secretive domain, the government launched the official defence procurement procedure in 2002. introduction of the offset policy in 2005 meant that anticipated cost of requests for proposal (rfps) exceeding rs 300 crore must include an offset clause amounting to at least 30 per cent of the indicative cost. these offsets could be in the form of direct purchase of designated defence products, services and fdi (foreign direct investment) in industry and r&d., what are the key growth drivers of this industry?, defence will be priority area for spending by the indian government given the recent conflicts and continued threats from terror strikes. keeping with the adage that ‘change brings opportunity,’ the defence industry in india is experiencing significant and progressive change. opportunities abound both for india inc. in meeting government of india’s defence requirements, and for the government in achieving its aspiration of autonomy in defence supply through the development of a home market defence industry., rising annual defence expenditure, big-ticket modernisation programme, simplified, transparent procurement procedures and overall macroeconomic growth are a few “push” factors available in this industry today., on the status of current equipment profile in the defence forces., the picture does not appear very encouraging. the current profile of the equipment held by our forces highlights the need for modernisation. ‘obsolete’ equipment currently accounts for 50 per cent of equipment, whereas the ministry of defence required profile would have this at 30 per cent. the proportion of state-of-the-art equipment also needs to grow from its current level of 15 per cent to at least 30 per cent., the indian armed forces have announced some significant procurement in recent years. the multi mission role combat aircraft (mmrca) deal to procure 126 combat aircraft amounting to $10.5 billion is india’s largest procurement deal. it has already earned the label of being “mother of all deals” amongst global defence and aerospace suppliers. there are several other billion-dollar-plus deals that are making india one of the most attractive markets for defence companies worldwide., why should the indian companies be excited?, they may well be. for, the current developments in the indian defence sector present the opportunity for india to become a part of the global supply chain., india is currently the 10th largest defence spender in the world with an estimated 2 per cent share of global defence expenditure; yet, 70 per cent of the equipments are imported and only 30 per cent of equipments being manufactured in india., the current policies display government’s keenness to reverse this ratio. two themes are very evident from the government’s official statements and policies. first, the realisation that overdependence on foreign suppliers is not conducive to national security in critical times; and secondly that this dependence can only be reduced with a pro-active involvement of both psus and the private sector., global aerospace and defence companies are currently facing a fall in demand and increasing cost constraints in their domestic market. they are naturally looking at india from a strategic perspective. india also offers trained and skilled workers who could form a large and qualified resource pool for them., many leading indian industrial houses such as the tata group, larsen & toubro ltd, the mahindra group, and kirloskar brothers ltd are diversifying into this sector, forming joint ventures with foreign companies on both strategic and product-specific bases., what do you see as the factors providing a sustained push to this industry?, the defence psus, drdos and ordnance factories have great capacity for technology absorption. however it is clear that they will not be able to meet the emerging requirement of offsets without the involvement of private defence industry., it is to be noted that as on date offset contracts worth rs 7,500 crore have already been signed. year 2010 will see a major implementation of these projects on ground. smes have a good chance to be tier i/ii suppliers for indian oems and may expect to earn significant revenues through defence supply with the right business strategy and investment in indian defence technology., the government, however, needs to provide a realistic “push” with the same vigour as done for psus given the fact that this industry is capital-intensive, has a long gestation period and requires meticulous planning., some of the key aspects that need to be looked at are:, • development of a national industrialisation strategy for defence that can go a long way in creating an oriented industry. a key step towards this could be introduction of offset multipliers that would facilitate transfer of core technologies (as against low-end technology) to india. i would like to quote the example of saudi arabia’s offset policy that is seen as an extension to the country’s industrial policy. their policy puts emphasis in not providing work for domestic industry but on encouraging foreign companies to form joint ventures with saudi partners to reduce economy’s dependence on oil., • having a dedicated senior official at the ministry to facilitate entry of private sector would enable creation of true level-playing field., • allow an official platform of interaction with the private industry at the policy-making level., • increase of fdi limit from the current 26 per cent would allow access to desired niche technology and processes., • an increase in the periodicity of banked offset by foreign oems. current validity of 2.5 could result into lapsing of offset earned by global players thereby act as a deterrent., • withdrawal of protective cover from the ordnance factories and defence psus., your take on what the key stakeholders expect., the three stakeholders in this scenario i.e. the indian government, the indian industry and the global players have legitimate expectations from one another. government expects indian industry to respond to this opportunity in a rapid and well-structured manner, making the best use of the skills, capabilities and resources available to it., economic and industrial growth would be the real “win” for the government. indian industry expects government to provide a defence industrialisation strategy and appropriate planning, procurement, legal, regulatory and tax environments. the industry would win with expansion of new technology and their export portfolio., global integrators “win” by attaining productivity gains and cost reduction. they expect smoother entry processes, single-window clearances and enhanced fdi limit for obtaining the same. i would like to quote the example of kongsberg (norway) and lockheed martin that formed a successful joint venture (klm space data systems) to develop the svalbard ground station on spitsbergen island as an f-16 contract offset project. the enterprise value being $50 million, the enterprise has grown to half a billion dollars that has been a win-win for all stakeholders., any lessons from the developed world?, major countries such as the us, the uk, france and others have evolved with efficient and transparent defence procurement procedures. issues like integrated project teams, smart acquisition process, top-down approach in acquisitions have to be addressed regularly., india is a beginner in the field of offset and zealous defence procurement reforms. it is important that each step taken must contribute effectively towards enhancement of the defence procurement machinery., a few steps such as the following could go a long way in this direction:, • enhancement of dofas (defence offset facilitating agency) capabilities with expertise in field of accounts, technology and legal affairs of offset contracts to provide a significant window to evaluate proposals and oversee implementations both technically and financially., • creation of an aptly trained specialist team with longer posting tenures to undertake the procurement functions. for example, in france acquisition is largely left to special bodies to complete the process within the desired time and the desired technology criteria. the defence forces only need to spell out broad operational requirement., an organisation such as the dma (defence manufacturers’ association) of the uk can serve as a platform for voicing concerns of the industry, advising the government on policy issues, and also provide export opportunities through intensive interaction with global primes and their suppliers.",0.10171171450630047,india ’ growth opportunity defence,"neelu khatri , manager , defence advisory services , kpmg. , defence could next boom ( information technology ) automotive sectors ,

2010-02-18,the funding gap persists,"union finance minister pranab mukherjee has flagged an area of serious concern while speaking about the development of infrastructure. with just two years left in the current five-year plan, he says that at the present flow of investment it may not be possible to raise the $514 billion required during this period. the public private partnership (ppp) mode has become the preferred option of both the central and state governments. though the inflow of foreign direct investment (fdi) has shown an upward trend, it does not really help since much of it goes into the capital market. the future of the indian economy, which is expected to grow at about 7.2 per cent this year, seems tied to the growth of the infrastructure sector. economists and investment analysts suggest that the tardy progress in infrastructure development could shave off up to two percentage points in the overall growth. to return to a nine per cent growth trajectory, removing infrastructure bottlenecks is critical. a ppp policy has been enunciated, rules have been framed for the collection of toll in the roads sector, and the state governments have also realised that the yawning gap in infrastructure could be bridged only through fdis and adoption of the ppp. despite all this, not much seems to be happening on this crucial front.",-0.024122807017543855,funding gap persists,"union finance minister pranab mukherjee flagged area serious concern speaking development infrastructure. two years left current five-year plan , says present flow investment may possible raise $ 514 billion required period. public private partnership ( ppp ) mode become preferred option central state governments. though inflow foreign direct investment ( fdi ) shown upward trend , really help since much goes capital market. future indian economy , expected grow 7.2 per cent year , seems tied growth infrastructure sector. economists investment analysts suggest tardy progress infrastructure development could shave two percentage points overall growth. return nine per cent growth trajectory , removing infrastructure bottlenecks critical. ppp policy enunciated , rules framed collection toll roads sector , state governments also realised yawning gap infrastructure could bridged fdis adoption ppp. despite , much seems happening crucial front .","{'bjp': 0, 'cong': 0}",0,0
2010-02-21,tax expectations of the technology industry,"abhishek goenka , it’s that time of the year again when expectations surrounding budget 2010 resonate. yet, for many specific reasons, this budget is being watched keenly, says abhishek goenka, a partner in bmr advisors’ corporate tax practice, leading the firm’s technology industry practice., the main reason for the special interest about the budget is that it comes on the heels of the national and global sound-bites surrounding economic recovery and, therefore, people are looking for signs that the budget will provide on the continuation or otherwise of the fiscal stimulus, adds abhishek, in the course of a recent pre-budget email interaction with business line., “the other reason, of course, is that the government’s fiscal deficits are no cause for envy and, as has been the case now for the last few years, balancing populism with prudence will be crucial.”, mr pranab mukherjee brings a unique combination of crucial financial acumen, astute political understanding and the ability to carry people along, opines abhishek. and hopes that “all these skills are equal ingredients in the fm’s melting pot.”, excerpts from the interview., on tax issues., on the tax front, the existing direct tax rates are expected to continue. the excise and customs duty rates and that for service tax could be increased marginally if there is a clear messaging on withdrawal of fiscal stimulus., with the direct taxes code (dtc) likely to take some more time, the government would do well if tax base broadening measures are introduced. in terms of structural changes to the direct tax law, clarity on a few fairly basic matters is desired., one of the long-standing asks of the it industry is clarity on software taxation. while the revenue officers have been treating payments for software products as royalty, the tax tribunals have been holding these as business income. the karnataka high court threw a spanner in the works by giving a new twist to the whole software issue, when it said that all payments to non-residents (be it for goods or otherwise) require tax withholding at source., while the supreme court is likely to give its verdict soon on this issue, a clarification to this effect in the tax law would be welcome since withholding tax is a starting point of tax administration and collection and there is no merit is uncertainty and complexity on that front., the fm’s recent comments on transfer pricing notwithstanding, this has been one of the most game-changing amendments in the law in the last decade. as we enter the next one, it is time to address some structural concerns., much to the delight of taxpayers, budget 2009 introduced the safe harbour provisions. however, like most other structural changes, the safe harbour amendment is still largely in cold storage as the rules to give effect to the amendment are yet to be introduced and investors with captive centres in india are still grappling with transfer pricing litigation in india with crores of revenue locked up., on llps., while for tax purposes, llps (limited liability partnerships) are by and large given the same tax treatment as partnership firms, there still appears to be a dichotomy in government’s stand insofar as tax treatment of llps is concerned., when it comes to presumptive taxation, partnership firms qualify, but llps don’t. as regards tax holiday for industrial undertakings, etc. (section 80-ia), companies qualify, but llps don’t., lack of clarity on fdi in llps only adds to the complications. llps provide clear advantages as a vehicle of doing business and that calls for complete clarity on the topic, both on the tax and policy side., on the tax policy matters., on the tax policy front, a reinforced messaging and more importantly a commitment on the timelines for the introduction of gst and the dtc should be at the forefront., although inconsistent with the larger objectives of pulling back on tax holidays, it will be a measured dose if the tax holiday for the it industry, currently set to expire on march 31, 2011, is extended selectively, at least for the sme sector. this will balance the government’s need for more revenues and also help in providing fiscal stimulus to the smaller units.",0.09730050505050508,tax expectations technology industry,"abhishek

2010-05-05,the flurries of voting day in mauritius,"an exercise in democracy: a woman casting her vote in the general elections in mauritius on wednesday. photo: pranay gupte , when i covered politics for the new york times a very long ago in the united states and in other countries that allowed for adult franchise, a wise old editor would often caution against making projections, particularly on election day. of course, those times were before smart pollsters brought their sophisticated techniques to gauge exit polls and voter sentiments, and well before television stations flashed informal results before candidacies were declared successful., the tv stations here in mauritius do no such thing; there are few, if any, reliable polls; votes are hand counted; and as this island-nation's 880,000 registered voters cast their ballots on wednesday, it was not even clear just how many mauritians showed up at the booths set up in schools and public institutions. radio stations broadcast differing percentile figures throughout the day. although wednesday had been declared a national holiday to encourage voters to trek to the polls, it was clear that enough of them chose leisure over the obligations of citizenship., so clear, in fact, that prime minister navin ramgoolam — who is leading a three-party alliance that he hopes will give him a second successive five-year term — took to the radio waves himself and appealed to his fellow countrymen to overcome their ennui. in the afternoon, he walked from door to door in his constituency urging people to cast their ballot., it was not something that prime ministers are wont to do, but the 63-year-old mr. ramgoolam is that rare breed of politician who actually knows many of his constituents by name, and makes it a point to stay in personal contact even when election season is over. so visiting constituents' homes was generally perceived as something less than political opportunism., he shares that characteristic with his political nemesis, paul berenger, the former prime minister who leads the left-win mouvement militant mauricien (mmm). in an interview with the hindu, mr. berenger said he was energised by his tour through his constituency and those of 19 others; these constituencies, plus one in the neighbouring island of rodriguez, send 60 victors to the national parliament., but mr. berenger acknowledged that mr. ramgoolam's alliance had “far more money, many more cars, and lots more party workers”., still, he said, he was confident that the mmm would win. asked about the general perception that his french ancestry made him tilt in favour of the economic and other interests of european nations such as france and britain, mr. berenger seemed unperturbed. he sensed the subtext of my question., “look,” mr. berenger said, “india need not worry if i became prime minister. i have always said that the relationship between our two countries is umbilical. it cannot be broken, it can only be strengthened.”, one way of interpreting his remark is that even under a leftist government led by a representative of a minority franco community in an island-nation of 1.3 million that is dominated by hindus — with creoles, muslims, chinese, and christians added to the mix — mauritius would find it disadvantageous to strain its relationship with india. after all, mauritius channels nearly $12 billion in foreign direct investment to india annually, making it the latter's biggest supplier of fdi. rest assured that much of this money is not indigenous: it comes from somewhere else, and mauritius surely gets a percentage of the take. would mr. berenger really want to re-shape that reality?, “my reality is good governance,” mr. berenger said, in his deep french-coated voice. “my concern is electoral and political reforms that would bring more justice in our system.”, i was tempted to ask why such reforms were not undertaken when mr. berenger served as prime minister from 2003 to 2005. but i anticipated his answer: not sufficient time. besides, it would have been unkind to pose such a question, even to a veteran politician, on a day that he was so earnestly trying to drum out votes for his party., i put a different sort of question to nita deerpalsing, a parliamentarian and spokeswoman for mr. ramgoolam's mauritius labour party. was she satisfied with voter turnout?, “very satisfied,” ms deerpalsing said., did she plan to speak to the prime minister about her hunches concerning election results?, “i'm concentrating all my energies in my constituencies,” she said, somewhat sharply., will the three-party alliance win when the election results are formally announced by midday on thursday?, “of course.”, that seemed as good a thought with which to gracefully exit the conversation., to put it another way, as my wise old editor would say, never project, never predict, never prognosticate. tomorrow is, after all, another day — and a single day can be an entire lifetime in the politics of clangorous multiparty democracies, even if they are tiny island states whose main claim to global fame was the fact that the long extinct dodo bird was spotted nowhere else in the world but here, by dutch settlers more than three centuries ago., the dodo bird may have been long gone, but mauritian politics has taken full flight. stay tuned.",0.16157241492684524,flurries voting day mauritius,"exercise democracy : woman casting vote general elections mauritius wednesday. photo : pranay gupte , covered politics new york times long ago united states countries allowed adult franchise , wise old editor would often caution making projections , particularly election day. course , times smart pollsters brought sophisticated techniques gauge exit polls voter sentiments , well television stations flashed informal results candidacies declared successful. , tv stations mauritius thing ;

2010-05-06,lula and the brazilian moment,"brazil's president luiz inacio lula da silva in brazil. file photo: ap , time magazine has just named president luiz inacio lula da silva the world's most influential leader. barack obama is ranked fourth. prime minister manmohan singh is 19th (there are only four heads of state or government in the list). this is an exercise somewhat different from the traditional “person of the year” selection time engages in each december, but highly revealing nonetheless. it is defined as “not about the influence of power, but about the power of influence.” time has never selected a latin american leader as person of the year. in india, mahatma gandhi made it in 1930., brazil, once known as “the country of the future” that would always remain as such, has come a long way. that this should happen at the close of the eight-year presidency of the leader of the brazilian workers party (the pt, partido dos trabalhadores), whose very election prospects in 2002 led to a run on the real, the brazilian currency, and bovespa, the sao paulo stock market, is striking., what is the secret of lula and brazil's success? how come a country best known until 20 years ago for its runaway inflation and rollercoaster economy has made it its present condition an investors' darling, that applies highly effective social policies, and that has positioned itself as a veto player in international affairs, one without whose acquiescence no major global initiative is viable?, with a land mass of some 8.5 million square kilometres, the world's fifth largest, comparable to the continental united states, brazil is more a continent than country. with a population of 190 million, and growing fast, it is not quite in the same league as china and india (which is why some people said there were “only two brics in the wall”), but is still the fifth most populated country. more than one out of three latin americans is brazilian. with a gdp approaching $2 trillion, it is the eighth largest economy., yet, brazil's size has been immense ever since its independence in the 19th century, whereas its rise to the frontlines of international affairs has taken place only in the past 20 years. why?, the answer is simple: presidential leadership. most would be hard-pressed to name a brazilian president from the 1960s to the 1990s. for 20 years the country was run by obscure generals, and in 1985, with the return of democracy, by lacklustre civilians, who did little to combat the runaway inflation and the deep imbalances in one of the most unequal societies in the world., lula has done a remarkable job, but he stands on the shoulders of his predecessor, fernando henrique cardoso (1994-2002). it was as the improbable minister for finance of president itamar franco in 1993 that cardoso, a sociologist, made his mark. he was the author of the plan real that brought inflation under control, and launched him all the way to planalto, the presidential palace in brasilia. much like 1991 was a turnaround year in india, when under finance minister manmohan singh the country started to liberalise and open up its economy, 1993 was such a year in brazil, and it has never looked back., cardoso realised that brazil needed not just to stabilise its currency but also to open up and deregulate its economy, stifled by decades of rampant protectionism. he privatised state enterprises, opened the doors for fdi and pushed business into export markets. whereas in 1990 foreign trade reached 11 per cent of the gdp, it is now at 24 per cent. whereas until 1990 brazil attracted less than $1 billion a year in fdi, today it is, after china, the country in the developing world that attracts the most, reaching as much as $40 billion a year in recent times., by stabilising the polity and the economy (brazil had four presidents from 1985 to 1994), cardoso in his eight years did much to clear the underbrush for lula. and despite all the criticism lula had voiced from the opposition against cardoso's alleged “neoliberal” policies, once he took office in january 2003, he realised that only orthodox economic policies would keep the ghost of inflation away. lula appointed a conservative banker, henrique meirelles, head of the central bank, and briefed him to keep his eye on the inflation ball. as the economist has pointed out, for a country whose average yearly inflation in the early 1990s reached 700 per cent, to have in 2006 a growth rate that was, for the first time, higher than the inflation rate was quite a feat., lula, a former metal worker who lost one of his fingers on the factory floor, also came up with an imaginative social policy, the bolsa de familia. it transfers cash income to some 11 million families, who have to meet certain conditions (including school attendance of children, and monthly visits to government agencies), and has diminished brazil's income inequality., as a man who cut his political teeth in the trade union movement, lula knows all about “win-win” negotiations. he has also a remarkable ability to get along with everybody — from george w. bush to hugo chávez. the pt is only one among many in the fragmented brazilian party system (it controls only the governorships in three states out of brazil's 27), and he leads a coalition government that includes right-wing parties, in brazil's hard to manage “presidential coalitionism.” he has struck a delicate balance in which the private sector is the driving force of the economy, but the state plays a significant role through entities such as the banco nacional de desenvolvimento (bndes), which has a larger lending budget than the world bank, and petrobras, the state-owned oil company., in a country known for its populist, demagogic traditions, lula embodies the modern leader who believes in institutions. in a region where many presidents want to perpetuate themselves in office, he rejected the possibility of changing the constitution to allow him a third term. his own rags-to-riches trajectory and austere personal habits have meant that the corruption scandals that affected some of his staff never seriously dented his popularity, leading to the moniker of “teflon president”. his approval ratings have reached 80 per cent. he has been mentioned for a variety of top international jobs once he leaves office on 1 january 2011— from president of the world bank to secretary-general of the united nations., given that in foreign affairs also lula has made a big impact, this is not surprising. with celso amorim as his foreign minister, he has capitalised on brazil's “diplomatic gdp.”, with an outstanding foreign ministry — known as “itamaraty” for the 19th century palace in rio de janeiro that used to house it before the capital moved to brazilia — brazil has exercised its diplomacy with finesse and effectiveness. on the multilateral front, its ability to build coalitions, to give direction to the international agenda, and to take on key global governance issues has stood out. it has displayed it in the wto and the u.n., as well as in the creation of (or inclusion in) myriad acronyms such as brics, bricsam, ibsa, the g20+, the g4, the o5, and, most notably, in the g20 at the leaders level (“the steering committee of the world economy”) launched in washington in november 2008, and whose next meeting is being held in toronto in late june. it has also put its money where its mouth is: at a time when many foreign ministries have cut budgets and closed embassies, brazil, grasping that diplomacy has become more, and not less, significant in the age of globalisation, has done the opposite. from 2003 to 2008 it opened 32 embassies abroad, and now has 134., in latin america also brazil has played a key role. it has been the driving force behind new entities such as unasur, which has brought together all nations in south america, and the associated south american defence council, designed to provide an alternative to the by-now obsolete inter-american treaty of reciprocal assistance. it has taken the lead in stabilising haiti through minustah, the first u.n. peacekeeping mission formed by a majority of latin american troops and headed by a brazilian general. it is willing to work with washington, but not if that entails sacrificing principles such as democratic rule,

2010-05-06,mauritius elections hold promise for india,"mauritius prime minister navin ramgoomam cast his vote at a polling booth in vacoas town, mauritius. file photo: ap , now that the three-party alliance of navin ramgoolam has won 41 of the 60 seats in the mauritius national parliament — more than double the number of paul berenger's leftist mouvement militant mauricien — there is general agreement that the 63-year-old former physician and lawyer has obtained a powerful mandate to implement economic and social reforms in his second consecutive term as this island-nation's prime minister., some of those reforms eluded him during his first term; indeed, a few unpopular measures that mr. ramgoolam introduced — such as a national residential property tax, and another tax on interest from savings — spurred flight of capital in certain circles. the expectation is that such measures will be reviewed and possibly eliminated., the prime minister has also pledged a more aggressive “democratisation” of the economy — ensuring, among other things, that ownership of the vast sugarcane plantations that are currently controlled by the minority whites of french descent is also made accessible to other communities in this country of 1.3 million people dominated by hindus. creoles, christians and muslims also compromise larger sections of the demographic cohort than the francos. a special “democratisation unit” has been formed in the prime minister's office, and its workload is certain to be amplified., mr. ramgoolam's election victory has also brought relief to several business supporters who had been targeted by mr. berenger and his financial backers. they had been apprehensive that the berenger group would subvert, if not entirely destroy, their commerce., opposition claim, the 65-year-old mr. berenger, silver-haired and wearing an open-necked blue shirt, appeared at a gathering of followers early on thursday evening and promised to continue “fighting the good fight”, and promised to work toward national unity. he was gracious about the prime minister's victory — a sentiment not necessarily appreciated by many in his audience — but asserted that the elections were neither free nor fair. mr. berenger chided the national television network for blatantly favouring the prime minister's alliance in order to ensure its victory., the ramgoolam alliance's victory, however, will most definitely be welcomed by india, not the least because mauritius contributes $12 billion in foreign direct investment to india, by far the biggest annual fdi from any country. mr. berenger — a former prime minister himself — while publicly proclaiming his fidelity to an “umbilical relationship” with india, has been known to privately express a desire for strengthened commercial and political relations with france and other western powers., india's chief election commissioner navin chawla has been here for the last several days at the invitation of the government. he was not an official observer, of course, but other indian representatives in mauritius must feel emboldened now to suggest stronger technical, educational and computer-science links between both countries. they are surely mindful of the disappointment of influential mauritian business leaders that such ties were not deepened by india in the last few years., but they are also mindful that mr. ramgoolam enjoys a warm personal rapport with his indian counterpart, prime minister manmohan singh. on thursday, therefore, there were renewed expectations that mr. ramgoolam's new term could usher in an era characterised by enhanced bilateral economic and political relations., those expectations took into account a public position by mr. ramgoolam that the indian ocean coral atoll of diego garcia — part of the chagos archipelago — would be turned over to mauritius by the united states, which has maintained a large military base there since a 1971 secret agreement with the british labour government of then prime minister harold wilson. that agreement called for diego garcia to be leased to the u.s.; the military base has been used by washington for missile launches and naval operations against suspected terrorist havens in iraq, pakistan and afghanistan, and also parts of africa., some indian critics have long felt that the american presence on diego garcia represented a form of political hegemony in the indian ocean, territory that ordinarily should be viewed as within india's sphere of influence., mr. ramgoolam has also suggested that mauritius co-administer tromelin island, currently a french territory., concern for india, but one major issue of concern to india that may crop up during his new administration is that of china's growing economic presence in mauritius, and its ambition to widen political influence throughout africa. for example, china is building a new palm-frond-shaped airport here; it is also creating an industrial city from where goods will be re-exported to africa and europe., it is not that mr. ramgoolam is particularly wooing china, although its contribution to the local economy has been welcomed. it is india that has lagged in taking timely advantage of the economic opportunities available in a country of high literacy and aspirations to become a high-tech centre for the region., such geopolitical considerations, of course, were not quite the stuff of the main conversations on thursday in mauritius as the election results poured in, and the winners celebrated at rallies while losers lamented without seeming to be grieving. politics, after all, is not only about democracy, it is also about deportment., there was wide delight that mr. ramgoolam's second term would represent stability and continuity — his trusted lieutenant, deputy prime minister ahmed rashid beebeejaun won from his constituency in the capital of port louis, in what had been a race made difficult and ugly by his opponent.",0.03644018308080809,mauritius elections hold promise india,"mauritius prime minister navin ramgoomam cast vote polling booth vacoas town , mauritius. file photo : ap , three-party alliance navin ramgoolam 41 60 seats mauritius national parliament — double number paul berenger ' leftist mouvement militant mauricien — general agreement 63-year-old former physician lawyer obtained powerful mandate implement economic social reforms second consecutive term island-nation ' prime minister. , reforms eluded first term ;

2010-05-22,‘i am no friend of any operator’,"a. raja: “the irony is that the person who took the decision to price the spectrum that was allocated beyond 6.2 mhz is being accused of giving it away for a song!” photo : r. ragu , union communications and information technology minister a. raja says he has achieved what he had wanted to achieve as a minister: herald a telecommunications revolution in the country. in an interview to the hindu in new delhi on friday, he defends the decisions his ministry took on 2g spectrum allocation, expresses his confidence about bringing call rates down to 10 paise a minute, and outlines plans to reinvigorate bsnl and mtnl., soon after you were appointed communications and information technology minister, you said you would herald a telecom and technology revolution in the country. how have you fared so far?, in 2007, when i took over this ministry, on an average 75 lakh telephone connections were being added each month. in 2009 this increased to 1.2 crore connections a month., after i came back as telecom minister in upa-ii, the number rose to two crore a month. you should remember that the government's target was to provide 60 crore connections by 2012. we achieved this in march 2010 itself., in a span of just one year, tele-density has leaped from 39 per cent in 2009 to 53 per cent now. phone tariffs in india are among the lowest in the world because of the policies of my ministry. when prices of all other commodities are increasing, only telephone call rates are coming down. i told you in 2007 that i will get std call rates down to 25 paise. this has been achieved. i assure you that local call rates will soon be reduced further to 10 paise. this is nothing short of a miracle., you've also seen the 3g auction. i told you two years ago that we will get in excess of rs.40,000 crore. the auction exceeded our expectations and is an indication of the phenomenal growth that will take place in the coming decade., through the postal department, we have introduced india's largest micro life insurance policy. the department is more focused on its core competence and is taking on competition through a process of skill development, computerisation, and innovative products., in it, the biggest achievement has been setting up the national knowledge network that connects all universities, libraries, hospitals and agricultural institutions. the massive expansion of the national e-governance programme has been a boon to remote and far-flung villages. i can go on listing…, but the opposition is not impressed. the bjp and the cpi(m) want you out of office because they say your policies on 2g spectrum led to serious losses to the exchequer. they are basing this on the 3g auction prices…, let me explain chronologically. the national telecom policy 1999 was framed by the nda government. it laid down that the 2g spectrum has to be allotted on revenue share basis since the 1994 policy of auctioning failed miserably. the operators who bought the spectrum and the licences at that time went to court on the grounds that they were unable to pay and sought a direction to government to bail them out. the court directed the government to consider. in 1999, the government devised a policy that favoured the revenue route over that of the auction route., policy-wise, 2g is connected to the common man because it is a basic service meant for public health purposes, education and a valuable tool for improvement of rural economy. 3g is for the business community and for entertainment., from the point of revenue, let me first assert that there is no loss. one section of the media and some vested interests in the telecom industry are wilfully and wantonly suppressing the fact that we have made over rs.70,000 crore as revenue from 2g because we adopted the revenue route. as the subscriber base grows each year, we'll make upwards of rs.15,000 crore every year., the other question is this: if 3g auction issue went to egom empowered group of ministers, why not 2g. on the face of it, this question seems legitimate. but you have to remember that only when there is a difference of opinion between two ministries, does this happen. in this case, i referred the issue to the prime minister and requested him to constitute an egom because there was a difference of opinion on fixing the base price for 3g., in the case of 2g there was no such issue. the “no cap” policy number of operators per circle was endorsed by the telecom commission in which ministries of finance and industry are represented. it also has a planning commission member. since there was no deviation from the existing policy, and since the recommendations of trai were approved by the commission, there was no reason to refer it to the prime minister to constitute an egom., with due respect to the leaders of the opposition parties, the comparison between 2g and 3g is odious and irrational., but trai had recommended that the 3g auction price should be applied for 2g spectrum too. will the department of telecommunications and your ministry accept this recommendation?, trai, in its latest report, has reiterated that the starting spectrum for an operator up to 6.2 megahertz should not be auctioned. the question of pricing and rental beyond 6.2 mhz is what is being considered by trai. right now, trai is having further discussions on this issue based on the efficiency and scarcity value of 3g. once trai makes a recommendation we will take a decision after discussions in the telecom commission. i've allocated only 4.4 mhz each to operators., is there a reluctance to price 2g spectrum beyond 6.2 mhz because all those who hold the spectrum are very big operators?, you should remember that there is no contractual obligation on the part of the government to give additional spectrum to any operator beyond 6.2 mhz. i'm the first minister who raised the question as to why we should give spectrum free to any operator. i referred the matter to trai, and in my communication i told them that we have to charge up front for allocation over 6.2 mhz. the irony is that the person who took the decision to price the spectrum that was allocated beyond 6.2 mhz is being accused of giving it away for a song!, i'm no friend of any operator. some people might have been annoyed that a cartel was being broken and some others might have been irritated that their monopoly for about a quarter of a century was being taken away. this is a natural commercial instinct. i must face the consequences. the prime minister knows this very well. had i not done this, i would not have faced any problem. when this was raised in parliament, i said, “i don't want to be a stagnant, stinking pool…only flowing water generates current.” not only that. i've recorded in parliament that i'm the only minister of this department to have displayed the available spectrum bandwidth details on the website. this might have caused certain setbacks commercially to some in the industry. i'm being targeted for that reason too., the cbi, the cvc and even the cag are investigating the 2g spectrum allocation. you say you followed existing policy. then why is every investigating agency at your door step?, no minister is beyond scrutiny. simply because your blood has been offered to a lab, voluntarily or involuntarily, no one can conclude that you have a chronic disease with stigma., again let me explain. there are four issues: one, is it fair to issue and allocate spectrum bandwidth in 2008 at the same licence fee of rs.1,650 crore determined in 2001? two, is it the right policy to have adopted ‘first-come first-served' basis? three, why did you not auction 2g spectrum bandwidth allocation? and, four, does it not cause loss of revenue to the government as these firms that got the licence and the spectrum sold their shares at a higher price? i have repeatedly replied to these questions inside and outside parliament., the amount of rs.1,650 crore was determined by trai as licence fee in 2001, and new licences were issued at the same price even 40 days prior to my taking charge of this ministry. this was because trai did not give any new recommendations after 2001. but it continued to enhance the share in the adjusted gross revenue every year. due to this, an annual revenue of about rs.15,000 crore was accruing to the government., the second criticism is about our following the ‘first-come-first served' policy. in 1999, the cabinet decided not to auction spectrum bandwidth and preferred revenue-sharing method. since then, right through the tenure of pramod mahajan, arun shourie, till the tenure of dayanidhi maran, this policy continued., there's no other option when there is no scope for auction. hence, the same method was adopted during my tenure also. i've recorded this in parliament in the presence of arun shourie. no one has denied this and no one can dispute it., the third criticism is about non-auctioning of spectrum bandwidth. in 2007, the telecom commission accepted the recommendations of trai, which stated that it is not fair to go for auctioning to maintain a level playing-field as we have allocated spectrum without auction to the existing operators from 1999. the government too accepted and implemented it., the fourth criticism is about the disposal of shares by the new firms that got the allotment. normally, the finance ministry monitors such matters and takes an effort to establish whether it is right or wrong. after scrutiny of both swan and unitech at the hands of the finance ministry, the cabinet committee has approved its finding that these firms have not sold their shares but only diluted the shares to get fdi to raise towers and other infrastructure, well within the legal framework for promoting their business. neither my department nor i have any role in it. when this issue was raised for the first time, i discussed this with the prime minister and the then finance minister, p. chidambaram. the finance ministry is also of the firm view that shares have not been sold. even after deliberating several times, the criticism against it is continuing. is it out of ignorance or annoyance, or is it a systematic, politically motivated, disinformation campaign? it's for anyone to infer., you've been promising number portability and the deadlines seem to be shifting every time. when will we have number portability?, number portability is getting delayed because of problems in the import of equipment, and national security concerns. i'm continuously monitoring the situation. i'm confident that we'll have number portability by july., bsnl and mtnl have been on the wane for a few years now. the ministry does not appear to have done much to arrest the slide…, it's a fact that bsnl's revenues are down. this is because of the intense competition, our delayed reaction time, endless litigation, the implications of the sixth pay commission and huge delays in our tendering process. we're simply not able to react and move ahead., add to this our social obligations. we're the only ones that service the remotest of corners of our country. no private company of comparable size has the staff strength that we have. they do not have the social obligation we have when it comes to employment. we also have to service a huge number of landlines across the country and most of these are in places which have no other form of communication.",0.013428669496630664,‘i friend operator ’,"a. raja : “the irony person took decision

pitching for allowing fdi in retail sector. file photo: satish.h , the centre on tuesday sought suggestions from various stakeholders on opening up foreign direct investment (fdi) in multi-brand retail trading, an issue that could generate a lot of heat in political and business circles in the country., “keeping in view the large requirement of funds for back-end infrastructure, there is a case for opening up of the retail sector to foreign investment. at the same time, in the indian context, there is a view that this may be more appropriately done in a calibrated manner. we must ensure that the fdi does make a real contribution to address the inadequacies of back-end infrastructure. alongside, we need to address the challenge of integrating the small retailer in the value chain,”

2010-07-23,rangarajan lists priority initiatives for sustaining high growth,"the prime minister's economic advisory council (pmeac) on friday projected an economic expansion of 8.5 per cent for the current fiscal backed by a ‘substantial jump' in farm sector growth on the assumption of a normal monsoon and higher at 9 per cent in 2011-12 while cautioning that the high growth momentum would not be sustainable unless short and medium-term policy initiatives are in place to tackle high inflation, low productivity in agriculture and the deficit in physical infrastructure., releasing the council's ‘economic outlook for 2010-11' to the media here, which was submitted to the prime minister on thursday, pmeac chairman c. rangarajan noted that inflation, which has remained a major source of concern in the economy for more than a year, needed to be tackled as a priority in the short-term., dr. rangarajan stressed that with the wpi-based headline inflation at 10.55 per cent in june on account of high prices of food items and fuel — a level which was more than twice the comfort level for the people — the reserve bank should take some strong monetary measures or at least some ‘baby steps' to contain the price spiral as the inflationary pressures were now evident in the non-food manufacturing sector. “a bias towards monetary tightening is necessary,” he said., the pmeac chief, however, acknowledged that food inflation had started softening and the overall inflation would also start easing by august-september and soften further to about 7-8 per cent by december and eventually decline to 6.5 per cent by the end of march next year on account of higher farm output., farm output, the farm sector, he said, was expected to grow by 4.5 per cent, industry by 9.3 per cent and services by 8.5 per cent this fiscal and all these segments would account for the higher growth at 8.5 per cent as compared to the earlier projection of 8.2 per cent growth., following to years of poor monsoon rainfall, which resulted in a farm growth of 0.2 per cent in 2009-10 and 1.6 per cent in the year earlier, a normal monsoon would boost agriculture prospects and lead to 4.5 per cent expansion, albeit aided by a low base., turning to the area of economic policy, dr. rangarajan said there were clearly three issues that were, and would continue to remain, of primary importance in ensuring sustainable economic growth at rates of 9 per cent or higher., “the first is containing inflation, the second is ensuring steady improvement in farm productivity and incomes, and the third is closing the large physical infrastructure deficit, especially in the power sector,” he said, quoting the report., in particular, the overall low farm productivity would stand in the way of 9 per cent growth projections in the long run and this called for improving water and soil management along with better farm practices and cultivation of a wider range of crops. “we need to develop an integrated approach to these issues,” he said., infrastructure deficit, the third area in which medium-term policy initiatives were necessary so as to maintain the growth momentum was the large gaps in physical infrastructure. “in the power sector, as against a planned target for creating 78,740 mw, it appears we would be lucky to get 62,000 mw by march 2012. this rests on large capacities being commissioned in 2010-11 and 2011-12. the failure to create physical infrastructure in time has not only been persistent, but has also been a significant contributor to lower competitiveness,” the pmeac said, on the positive side, the council viewed that nine per cent growth next fiscal would be possible on the back of high investment and savings rates of 38.4 per cent and 36 per cent during the year. alongside, assuming slow recovery in the west, dr. rangarajan felt that capital inflows would be sufficient to cover the current account deficit estimated at 2.7 per cent of gdp this fiscal — which is expected to be revised downwards —- and add to the forex reserves., although portfolio investment is likely to decline to $ 25 billion this fiscal from $ 32 billion in 2009-10, robust fdi

2010-08-01,climate change in the u.k.-india partnership,"climate change, till now a ‘global' issue, is inserting itself into india's bilateral agenda as well. for, at david cameron's initiative, it is to be a central leg of the strategic new u.k.-india relationship., collaboration has begun with the u.k.-india business leaders climate group. comprising well-known ceos, the group will work jointly on national emissions-reduction strategies, private sector-driven low-carbon models, and synergistic business opportunities., given climate change's stated importance in the u.k.-india partnership, policy-makers and business leaders in both countries might find it useful to leaf through unctad's just-released world investment report 2010: investing in a low-carbon economy, which examines global flows of ‘low carbon' foreign direct investment and proposes strategies to encourage it., the report makes two essential points, which if implemented could significantly enrich the u.k.-india initiative. one: transnational corporations should be factored into global efforts to mitigate climate change, since they are both principal greenhouse gas emitters and ‘low carbon' technology innovators, two: it might be time for governments to expand the climate change discourse beyond a single-minded focus on national targets to incorporate performance milestones for individual firms. (in fact, going a step further, u.k.'s environment minister has broached the subject of tradeable carbon credits for each individual briton)., it also presents a number of ideas for the two nations to pilot within their partnership, while using their joint experience to advance the climate change effort at the global level. for instance, fdi could be mainstreamed into low-carbon development strategies, with both countries working together to promote and support low-carbon investors and encourage strategic technology. they also need to ensure that policies incentivise, reward, and create a market for low-carbon investments, while incorporating climate-friendly provisions (including low-carbon investment promotion and environmental exceptions) into investment agreements. the report also suggests the establishment of an international low-carbon technical assistance centre, combining a global low-carbon technology database with advisory and support services., the most compelling idea is the creation of a single global standard for corporate greenhouse gas emissions disclosure, which would significantly boost the accuracy of emissions monitoring and correction. the report finds 87 of the world's 100 largest transnational corporations reporting on emissions, many voluntarily. but it also finds two common gaps in this reporting. first, nearly a half of those that report are failing to specify the source of emissions — i.e. own operations, value chain, or energy use. second, only 21 disaggregate their emissions by country., in choosing practical initiatives to seed the u.k.-india environmental partnership, the u.k. government and the business leaders climate group might encourage british tncs in india to report in detail on their local greenhouse gas emissions. this would be the most powerful way by which to establish the u.k.'s dual commitment to india and environmental protection. it would also be a major step in advancing global and indian ‘best practice' in emissions disclosure., carbon disclosure is already a well-established practice in the u.k., and its carbon disclosure project (cdp) runs an annual survey of corporate emissions-reporting/ environmental management practices among british firms. by publicly reporting findings, cdp encourages firms to continually improve environmental performance, and keeps the public, policy-makers and investors in the loop. since 2007, cdp has run a similar survey in india, funded by the british high commission as part of its ‘low carbon high growth programme. survey results highlight areas for shared improvement., in cdp 2009, indian firms performed as well, if not better, than u.k. counterparts on basic parameters, such as measuring and recording emissions, separating them by source, and in setting reduction targets. but u.k. firms considerably outperform indian counterparts in public reporting on a variety of key parameters, including emissions, reduction targets, and emissions forecasts. they are also far ahead in isolating, measuring and reporting value-chain emissions., more important, many of u.k.'s top carbon disclosers — which outperform u.k. counterparts by a 20-points average — have a large and committed india presence. among them are unilever, royal dutch shell, hsbc, barclays, glaxosmithkline, thomas cook, reckitt benckiser, astrazeneca, aviva, and royal bank of scotland, who outperform counterparts by 30 (out of a potential 100) points on the very parameters in which indian firms are the weakest. all these firms are visible corporate citizens in india, and run active environmental and social responsibility programmes., there is thus much scope for a productive u.k.-india partnership on improved carbon disclosure. with climate change now firmly on the corporate agenda, indian firms are actively looking to develop best practice across a variety of related areas., a word of warning, though. while the u.k.-india environmental partnership is to rest on private sector collaboration, the world investment report shows that the u.k. is still a minor player in global low carbon fdi. . only bp features in its ranking of top 20 foreign direct investors in the alternative/renewable energy generation, and only three u.k. firms — bp, bronzeoak, and d1 oils — feature as top 20 investors in environmental technologies manufacturing (i.e. the production of wind turbines, solar panels, bio-diesel plants, and other environmental equipment)., bp made only nine of the 728 international greenfield investments in alternative/ renewable energy generation between 2003-2009; all these in developed economies. bp made twelve of the 806 greenfield international investments in environmental-technology manufacture in this period, ten in developed economies. bronzeoak made six and d1 oil five; all in developing economies. the world investment report provides no indication on the size of these various investments., this data is based on unctad's analysis of the 1,725 international greenfield investments and 281 mergers and acquisitions in renewables, recycling and low-carbon technology manufacturing between 2003-2009 – collectively worth us$344 billion. of these, 806 greenfield investments were in environmental-technology manufacture: nearly a half in developing economies. the 728 greenfield alternative/renewable energy investments and the 129 greenfield recycling investments concentrated in developed economies. in all cases, india has been an important destination., the report also surveyed 240 leading tncs to find climate change squarely on their agenda. 45 per cent of respondents said they factor host countries' ghg emissions-reduction requirements in planning investments, 32 per cent use in-house technologies, know-how and skills to reduce ghg emission in foreign projects, and 31 per cent use international m&as to obtain technologies and other created assets related to emissions reductions., but, the more committed india becomes to a low-carbon paradigm, the more carefully its policymakers will need to balance conflicting indian interests., take solar power. the government's new policy on grid-connected projects targets 100 per cent local equipment sourcing. this requirement could be counter-productive, in limiting our solar industry to a handful of (relatively new) local suppliers, whose equipment is often costlier than international competitors'. financing might also be more difficult initially, since financiers are more confident about tried-and-tested equipment. most worryingly, we might be blocking our industry from immediate access to important solar innovations internationally., another case in point is thermal power, where cost is still the defining parameter for technology choice, as a result of which we now liberally source power equipment from china, although it is considerably more polluting than costlier european and american models. — courtesy: u.n. information centre, new delhi",0.10461047831949473,climate change u.k.-india partnership,"climate change , till ‘global ' issue , inserting india ' bilateral agenda well. , david cameron ' initiative , central leg strategic new u.k.-india relationship. , collaboration begun u.k.-india business leaders climate group. comprising well-known ceos , group work jointly national emissions-reduction strategies , private sector-driven low-carbon models , synergistic business opportunities. , given climate change ' stated importance u.k.-india partnership , policy-makers business leaders countries might find useful leaf unctad ' just-released world investment report 2010 : investing low-carbon economy , examines global flows ‘low carbon ' foreign direct investment proposes strategies encourage it. , report makes two essential points , implemented could significantly enrich u.k.-india initiative. one : transnational corporations factored global efforts mitigate climate change , since principal greenhouse gas emitters ‘low carbon ' technology innovators , two : might time governments expand climate change discourse beyond single-minded focus national targets incorporate performance milestones individual firms.

economic issues affecting the united states and india, but really affecting the entire world.” photo: v. sudershan , even as india seeks foreign capital to build its physical infrastructure and has pitched for a comprehensive economic cooperation agreement with the united states as the next logical step following president barack obama's “historic” visit, the u.s. maintains that lack of reforms — especially in the financial services sector and foreign direct investment (fdi) policies — would stand in the way of india achieving the desired objectives. in an interview with ashok dasgupta,u.s. commerce secretary gary locke emphasised the need for india to be more open to foreign direct investment in a variety of sectors. on the issue of opening up to multi-brand retail, mr. locke said the matter was not discussed at all in deference to the sensitivities of the indian people. excerpts:, on what president obama's visit achieved, the achievement, i think, is the recognition of the very important role that india plays in the world economy with respect to political decisions touching the entire world. so, what you see from the president's visit is acknowledging the critical role that india plays not just within the region and not just in economic issues affecting the united states and india, but really affecting the entire world., the announcements over allowing more hi-tech goods to be purchased by india from the u.s. is a sign of respect for india and recognising that india is a true partner with the united states in the sharing of technology and also the support for having a permanent seat in the security council of the united nations. it's a statement by the u.s. that we recognise that india is a major economic and political force and should be treated that way in international bodies and in our relationship, economic and political and strategic., on the specifics, in terms of specifics, policies on high technology, the policies about reforming and modifying our export control regime as they relate to india will mean that companies in india will have access to hi-tech goods, whether in the areas of space exploration research and improvements and modernisation of the military. as the president indicated, both sides will have to move away from the stereotypes and the misperceptions about the realities of global trade. if we want to sell to india, india should be able to sell to the u.s. it can never be one way., on the issue of job losses, we really need to focus on the net increase in jobs for each country. there will be job creation in the u.s. when we sell to india and there will be job creation in india when india sells things to the u.s., what we really need to focus on is increased job creation on both sides. as long as we can show the american public that there is a net increase in jobs because of trade, then the american people will understand the benefits and the realities of a global economy., on hike in visa fees, we need to work with the congress on that because it was the congress that imposed those fees, not just on visas of workers coming from india but from any country around the world. it was not imposed by the u.s. administration, but by the congress and it was a bipartisan issue as it included the republicans as well as democrats. there were amendments and that was a way in which the congress could find the funds that they could use to pay for the increased cost of security measures along the u.s.-mexican and the u.s.-canadian borders., on the need to relax fdi policies, we believe that india should be more open to foreign direct investment in a variety of sectors, because we believe that some of the impediments for fdi actually hinder india's ability to achieve its goals of economic progress, job creation for the people and growth of the economy. if india wants foreign investment in construction of roads and bridges or other major infrastructure like water systems, ports and airports, you have to have a strong insurance system to attract that investment, not just from the united states but from germany, france or canada and other countries., it is not necessarily in the long-term economic interests of india to have these various restrictions on foreign investment because they may hinder india's ability to proceed with the economic and modernisation objectives that you have. for investments into large infrastructure projects, you need to ensure that you have the insurance cover and bonding that will cover large projects that might be initiated

2010-11-28,over-reliance on short-term capital flows?,"one of the key challenges before policymakers in emerging economies is to balance the interests of foreign capital with the needs of the domestic economy. in many countries, including india, there is now a much more nuanced view on the role of foreign capital than what obtained even a few years ago., in all developing countries there is a realisation that not all forms of cross-border capital inflows are equally desirable from a domestic perspective. the copious flows from foreign institutional investors (fiis) especially (can be an embarrassment) have prompted policy initiatives in many countries. at the present juncture, many emerging market economies ranging from brazil to indonesia have placed restraints on inward foreign capital flows., the situation in india is, however, quite different. even though at varying times in the recent past different people have argued for some form of controls or other, the position has not changed over the years. while there are ceilings for foreign investors in the debt and government securities markets, the equity markets are practically free from controls. and that is where the bulk of the foreign institutional money has been going into. the sheer volumes are a factor to be reckoned with., equally important the fact that the flow is particularly strong during specific periods — the investments from abroad seem to have a herd mentality — lends a new edge to the debate concerning such flows. for instance, between july and the third week of november, net capital inflows have been a record $28.6 billion. obviously, the term herd mentality can describe movements in the other way too. fii money tends to flee emerging markets in droves. most important of all, fiis' action, to invest or withdraw, is governed less by factors specific to india (or any other emerging market) and more by circumstances prevailing in their home countries., second, even factors that are only remotely connected with india seem to have a direct bearing on the flow and direction of such investments., third, in the scheme of things, as it exists today, most fund managers do not differentiate between countries classified under the same category such as, say, emerging markets. a decision to pull out (or to invest) is taken on the basis of such wide classification. hence, increased risk-aversion on the part of the fund mangers would imply that all the emerging markets would come under the scanner., the last point is best illustrated by the reaction of the markets to the heightened tension between north and south korea on tuesday last. suddenly all emerging markets — not just those located in the vicinity of the korean peninsula — became risky. indian stock markets witnessed one of its most volatile days of trading in recent memory. also, last week the irish debt crisis, with all its political and economic ramifications, hit the headlines. that, like the hostilities between north and south korea, is no doubt a portentous development, but it seems incomprehensible that it should sway stock markets everywhere in the way it did., india's approach to fii inflows is conditioned by the fact that they are necessary to bridge the current account deficit and provide a small cushion in the balance of payments. but what about the surge in inflows, which are expected for a variety of reasons? is the policy stance valid even if capital inflows increase enormously to, say, $70-75 billion this year as anticipated by top policymakers?, there is near unanimity that aggregate flows to india are set to increase. bulk of them, almost 80 per cent, will be in the nature of short-term flows. like other countries, india's preference is for the more permanent foreign direct investment (fdi). in recent years, fdi is increasing, but has fallen far short of the fiis. despite their being of short-term nature and hence having the propensity to flit in and out of countries fiis are needed at this juncture.",0.07904040404040404,over-reliance short-term capital flows ?,"one key challenges policymakers emerging economies balance interests foreign capital needs domestic economy. many countries , including india , much nuanced view role foreign capital obtained even years ago. , developing countries realisation forms cross-border capital inflows equally desirable domestic perspective. copious flows foreign institutional investors ( fiis ) especially ( embarrassment ) prompted policy initiatives many countries. present juncture , many emerging market economies ranging brazil indonesia placed restraints inward foreign capital flows. , situation india , however , quite different. even though varying times recent past different people argued form controls , position changed years. ceilings foreign investors debt government securities markets , equity markets practically free controls. bulk foreign institutional money going into. sheer volumes factor reckoned with. , equally important fact flow particularly strong specific periods — investments abroad seem herd mentality — lends new edge debate concerning flows. instance , july third week november , net capital inflows record $ 28.6 billion. obviously , term herd mentality describe movements way too. fii money tends flee emerging markets droves. important , fiis ' action , invest withdraw , governed less factors specific india ( emerging market ) circumstances prevailing home countries. , second , even factors remotely connected india seem direct bearing flow direction investments. , third , scheme things , exists today , fund managers differentiate countries classified category , say , emerging markets. decision pull ( invest ) taken basis wide classification. hence , increased risk-aversion part fund mangers would imply emerging markets would come scanner. , last point best illustrated reaction markets heightened tension north south korea tuesday last. suddenly emerging markets — located vicinity korean peninsula — became risky. indian stock markets witnessed one volatile days trading recent memory. also , last week irish debt crisis , political economic ramifications , hit headlines. , like hostilities north south korea , doubt portentous development , seems incomprehensible sway stock markets everywhere way did. , india ' approach fii inflows conditioned fact necessary bridge current account deficit provide small cushion balance payments. surge inflows , expected variety reasons ?

2010-12-05,raising the bar for new stock exchanges,"the decorated building of the bombay stock exchange. file photo , a committee of experts under the chairmanship of former reserve bank of india governor bimal jalan and comprising seasoned capital market and finance professionals was asked to review the ownership and working of market infrastructure institutions., its report, submitted to the securities and exchange board of india recently, effectively raises the bar for existing institutions and prospective entrants., they will have to comply with much higher standards of capital adequacy and governance than what they obtain now., the three market infrastructure institutions are: stock exchanges, clearing corporations and depositories., understandably, it is the stock exchanges that have received the maximum attention from the committee., in the reform era, it is the stock exchanges that have seen the most visible transformation. they have also attracted the maximum regulation., the other two, though playing a vital role in the capital market edifice, are in a sense adjunct to the stock exchanges., there is another topical reason why the committee's recommendations on stock exchanges have attracted so much interest., there have been plans by newer players to start an exchange. an attempt by mcx, a commodities exchange, to start a stock exchange has been thwarted by the regulator. if the panel's recommendations are accepted, the doors will be practically shut for many new parties., net worth, the committee report has, as its core recommendation, the provision that only banks, insurance companies and domestic public financial institutions with a net worth of rs.1,000 crore be anchor investors in a stock exchange, a position analogous to but not identical with promoters. the panel wants a widespread dispersal of shareholding in a stock exchange., these two provisions — of allowing only well capitalised parties as anchor investors and ensuring a dispersal of shareholding — are deemed necessary for the proper functioning of an exchange. they also rule out control by any one party. an anchor investor can hold 24 per cent of the share capital but should bring it down to 15 per cent within ten years., another key suggestion having a bearing on the balance-sheet of a stock exchange is to include off and on balance sheet expenses while calculating the limits to shareholding in a stock exchange. stock exchanges will not be allowed to list. this important provision should put an end to all controversies that will arise if stock exchanges list with one another. perhaps even more significantly the provision reinforces what seems to be the thrust of the committee's recommendation: that the business of a stock exchange should neither yield large profits nor be a magnet for speculative capital., critics point out that the denial of permission to list will reduce the number of exit options., investors will be essentially holding on to non-traded securities. foreign participation in a stock exchange and other market infrastructure institutions is capped at 49 per cent (fdi at 26 per cent and fii at 23 per cent)., other restrictions, there are other restrictions as well. they clearly underline the committee's intention to maintain the ‘demutualised' character of the exchanges., for instance, no trading member will be allowed to be on the board of stock exchanges except in the case of the advisory committees that deal with technology and other matters not directly connected to regulation., in the past decade, stock exchanges in india, which functioned as mutual associations of brokers, were asked by the regulator to convert into demutualised entities and keep the trading, ownership and management functions completely segregated., stock exchanges and other market infrastructure institutions should be made to follow the disclosure and governance requirements of the listing agreement applicable to listed companies. the compensation packages of senior stock exchanges will be kept on a leash., finally, the committee says that when a related business of a market infrastructure institution delivers a service to another market infrastructure institution, it should be ensured that there is equal, unrestricted, transparent and fair access to all without any bias towards its affiliated entity., to foster co-operation, the aim is to foster co-operation and the entity should not try to use its monopoly position to earn ‘super normal' profits that are drastically higher than average industry earnings in india. excess profits should be used for investor protection and settlements., the implications are: (1) based on the committee's report there will not be a rush for starting new exchanges. the barriers have been set high and the returns capped; and (2) the report realises that there will not be an increase in competition., the question is whether it will be disadvantageous to the consumer (investor)., it is a moot point whether unfettered competition among exchanges is to be endorsed at all and whether it will deliver all the presumed benefits., when it concerns market infrastructure institutions, there cannot be too many players competing for the same business., but it is the role of the stock exchange as a regulator that has made the committee pitch for high entry level norms and lay down stringent rules of governance.",0.08823219665324929,raising bar new stock exchanges,"decorated building bombay stock exchange. file photo , committee experts chairmanship former reserve bank india governor bimal jalan comprising seasoned capital market finance professionals asked review ownership working market infrastructure institutions. , report , submitted securities exchange board india recently , effectively raises bar existing institutions prospective entrants. , comply much higher standards capital adequacy governance obtain now. , three market infrastructure institutions : stock exchanges , clearing corporations depositories. , understandably , stock exchanges received maximum attention committee. , reform era , stock exchanges seen visible transformation. also attracted maximum regulation. , two , though playing vital role capital market edifice , sense adjunct stock exchanges. , another topical reason committee ' recommendations stock exchanges attracted much interest. , plans newer players start exchange. attempt mcx , commodities exchange , start stock exchange thwarted regulator. panel ' recommendations accepted , doors practically shut many new parties. , net worth , committee report , core recommendation , provision banks , insurance companies domestic public financial institutions net worth rs.1,000 crore anchor investors stock exchange , position analogous identical promoters. panel wants widespread dispersal shareholding stock exchange. , two provisions — allowing well capitalised parties anchor investors ensuring dispersal shareholding — deemed necessary proper functioning exchange. also rule control one party. anchor investor hold 24 per cent share capital bring 15 per cent within ten years. , another key suggestion bearing balance-sheet stock exchange include balance sheet expenses calculating limits shareholding stock exchange. stock exchanges allowed list. important provision put end controversies arise stock exchanges list one another. perhaps even significantly provision reinforces seems thrust committee ' recommendation : business stock exchange neither yield large profits magnet speculative capital. , critics point denial permission list reduce number exit options. , investors essentially holding non-traded securities. foreign participation stock exchange market infrastructure institutions capped 49 per cent ( fdi 26 per cent fii 23 per cent ) . , restrictions , restrictions well. clearly underline committee ' intention maintain ‘demutualised ' character exchanges. , instance , trading member allowed board stock exchanges except case advisory committees deal technology matters directly connected regulation. , past decade , stock exchanges india , functioned mutual associations brokers , asked regulator convert demutualised entities keep trading , ownership management functions completely segregated. , stock exchanges market infrastructure institutions made follow disclosure governance requirements listing agreement applicable listed companies. compensation packages senior stock exchanges kept leash. , finally , committee says related business market infrastructure institution delivers service another market infrastructure institution , ensured equal , unrestricted , transparent fair access without bias towards affiliated entity. , foster co-operation , aim foster co-operation entity try use monopoly position earn ‘super normal ' profits drastically higher average industry earnings india. excess profits used investor protection settlements. , implications : ( 1 ) based committee ' report rush starting new exchanges. barriers set high returns capped ;

elect, phd chamber, during the 105th annual session of the phd chamber in new delhi on friday. photo: v. sudershan , even as the indian economy has become remarkably resilient to external and domestic shocks with broad-based recovery in agriculture, industry and services, finance minister pranab mukherjee on friday enumerated the various challenges that need to be tackled to achieve double digit growth on a sustainable basis., in his inaugural address at the 105th annual session of the phd chamber of commerce and industry here, mr. mukherjee said: “this rapid recovery of the growth momentum is comforting, but we cannot be complacent as there are several challenges that the indian economy faces from its current external and domestic context.”, for one, the global recovery remains fragile and the “‘creeping increase' in international crude oil and other commodity prices is a reality that we are already confronting,” he said. while the oil marketing companies have had to increase petroleum product prices earlier this month, “there are also domestic supply side pressures on food prices that we have been grappling with for the past several months,” he said., “it double-digit growth must be on a sustainable basis and for that, we shall have to ensure that the challenges that we are facing today, one on the price front, another on fiscal consolidation and third certain developments which are taking place internationally are met,” he said., alongside, while foreign direct investment (fdi) flows have moderated, there has been a significant increase in inflows from foreign institutional investors (fiis). sounding a note of caution on this front, mr. mukherjee said: “so far, foreign capital flows are well within the absorptive capacity of our economy and exchange rate and monetary management has not been unduly challenged. this can change at short notice, we have to be alert and monitor the developments constantly.'', mr. mukherjee maintained that as of now, the economy had the capacity to absorb the capital flows., “if this goes beyond a point, definitely that would be a matter of concern but that may be in near future but not right now and, therefore, i am not pressing a panic button right now,” he said., the finance minister also pointed out that merely attaining high growth owing to remarkable performance in a few select sectors of the economy would be meaningless without inclusive growth. “as we go back to the high growth path, the challenge is to harness growth to make the development process more inclusive, improve the reach and quality of our social and economic infrastructure, reduce regional imbalances and improving the opportunities for the less privileged, while strengthening the role of government as an enabler…the benefits of economic growth have to percolate down effectively to the most marginalised and vulnerable segments of the population,” he said., drawing the broad contours of the ‘inclusive' development process mr. mukherjee maintained that the government was on the right track and exuded confidence that overall growth during the last two quarters of the current fiscal year would be as encouraging as the 8.9 per cent expansion posted in the first half of the year. “it is expected the...two quarters would be as encouraging, if not better... we assume that we will be able to reach 8.5-8.7 per cent of gdp growth

sharp swings in share prices are by no means uncommon but the precipitous drops of the type seen last in january 2008 when the market valuations plunged by an amazing two-thirds are, of course, rare and more relevantly difficult to predict., to answer the questions, one has to look at the peaks and troughs of stock prices over a fairly recent period. the week ended february 4 was especially noteworthy. after recording some marginal gains from the middle of the week, the indices recorded heavy losses on the close of the week. sensex lost 441 points (about 2.5 per cent) to close just above 18000. nifty fell below the psychologically significant 5400-mark. to view over a slightly longer period, the markets started rising strongly in august, 2010, to peak at 21005 on november 5. the fall by 3,000 points (14.28 per cent) since then until february 4 is significant. what is worse is that seemed to presage the worse things to come., the gloomy forecasts seemed to come true sooner than anticipated. stock prices dropped sharply on tuesday last. sensex traded below 18000 and nifty around 5350 in the forenoon session. the fall in stock prices continued into the following week (february 7 to 11)., a sense of deep pessimism has permeated the markets. all of a sudden, uncertainty seems to have engulfed the markets. barely two weeks before the presentation of the union budget, the downward movement of stock prices has acquired a distinct, negative connotation of its own. will the two major worries of the government — inflation and the burgeoning current account deficit — invite strong fiscal measures in addition to what the reserve bank of india has been doing?, there is no doubt at all that inflation and the current account deficit (expected to be around 3.7 per cent of the gdp) are the major concerns. but they have been so for quite some time. the reasons why stock markets latched on to the bad news all of a sudden ignoring the good ones need to be looked at from the totality of circumstances., india's growth story has by no means derailed. according to the central statistical organisation's advance estimates for 2010-11, the gdp growth will be at a respectable 8.6 per cent. this is below the upper-end of the government's expectations of between 8.5 and 8.75 per cent but slightly above the rbi's 8.5 per cent., in each of the first two quarters of this year, the economy has grown by 8.9 per cent. hence, the estimate of 8.6 per cent for the whole year suggests a slowdown in the third and fourth quarters. besides, when final figures come, a deceleration in manufacturing during the second half of the year will be seen. during the first two quarters, manufacturing grew by 13 per cent and 9.8 per cent, respectively. such a performance is unlikely to continue during the rest of this year. however, the cso' estimate of manufacturing growth during the whole year at 8.8 per cent is the same as what was achieved last year., inflation and the widening current account deficit are the major macro economic concerns. but india faces even greater problems of perceptions — corruption and in governance especially., the india story may be substantially on track but the reasons why the stock markets apparently do not think so is to be seen in the actions of global investors, especially the foreign institutional investors (fiis), who have come to occupy such an important place in the indian markets. their large investments are for short-term and often volatile but they are considered necessary to bridge the current account deficit. there is an obvious preference for the more stable fdi (foreign direct investment) but it has been going down this year as reported by the rbi at the time of the last review.",0.06683636173767753,stock markets downhill mode,"stock markets suddenly losing sheen ?

2011-02-16,"prime minister manmohan singh's interaction with editors of the electronic media on feb.16, 2011","february 16, 2011, new delhi, preliminary transcript, pm’s opening remarks, it is real pleasure meeting you on this auspicious occasion when we are all celebrating the birthday of hazrat mohammad shah . today is eid and on this occasion i would like to felicitate all our country men and women and extend my greetings. may this eid bring, added peace and prosperity to the people of india., during the last couple of months, the media have drawn the country’s attention to some aberrations whether in the form of allocation of 2g spectrum, the commonwealth games and more recently some developments in the space organization, adarsh society affairs. i think media have played a very important role in drawing the country’s attention to these issues which require corrective action. i wish to assure you and i wish to assure the country as a whole that our government is dead serious in bringing to book all the wrong doers, regardless of the position they may occupy. however i would like to say that in projecting these events an impression has gone round that we are a scam-driven country and that nothing good is happening in our country. in the process, believingly, i think we are weakening the self-confidence of the people of india. i don’t that it is in the interest of anybody in our country. we have a functioning government, and whatever some people may say that we are a lame duck government that i am a lame duck prime minister, we take our job very seriously, we are here to govern and to govern effectively, tackle the problems as they arise and get this country moving forward on a pace of development which would do justice to the demands being made on the process of governance., i wish to tell you that our economy is in good shape. we will have a growth rate of 8.5 percent this fiscal year and that the way india has come out and tackled the aftermath of international financial crisis, i think does our country a great credit. it is certainly true that in recent months inflation and food inflation in particular has been a problem. we want to deal it in a manner that the growth rhythm is not disturbed. if we were concerned with only curbing inflation i think we could have done it by pursuing tighter monetary policies, we could have brought about a situation where price rise could be moderated. but if in the process, growth process gets hurt i think that would not do our country any good and we are trying to deal with inflation at a time when we don’t have all instruments at our command in the sense that we do not have control over international events. we are now increasingly an open economy and the oil prices are rising, the food prices are rising, commodity prices are rising, we have to deal with inflation despite an adverse international environment and you have my assurance that we will succeed. and at the end of the fiscal year, the inflation rate should come down to no more than 7 percent., also i would like to mention that internal security of the country has been a great concern. i wouldn’t like to say that we are not worried about terrorist acts. we are better prepared to deal with acts of terror and prevent many potential terrorist acts and i think the government deserves some credit. in the north east, things are getting normalized. talks are going to begin with ulfa and the ulfa leadership having decided to give up the path up violence is a welcome development which will have far reaching consequences for the growth process in our north eastern states., in same way, in j&k, after some turbulence there are i think signs we are getting the situation under control and that the people of j&k can look forward to orderly development of development processes. a number of committees are working to chart out that path and dr. rangarajan is preparing a report on the employment aspects, and if that report is implemented, it would bring a fresh ray of hope to young people in j&k who are eagerly searching for productive employment opportunities., as far as the external situation is concerned, i think this fiscal year, all the top leaders of the five permanent members of security council have visited our country. this has never happened before and the world today appreciates that india is a democracy, a functioning democracy, committed to the rule of law, committed to respect of fundamental human rights, is trying to seek its economic and social salvation in the framework of democracy and rapidly expanding the economy too. wherever i go, people marvel that there is a country like india, a country of a billion people, a functioning democracy, committed to the rule of law, committed to respect for all fundamental human freedoms and yet managing to grow at the rate of 8-9% per annum. people marvel that this can be done and whatever our own domestic weaknesses i think, we should not create an atmosphere whereby the nation loses its sense of self confidence., the media has an obligation, the government has an obligation, the opposition has an obligation that we work together in a spirit that india as a whole has to march forward. parliament has not been allowed to function for reasons which i am not able to understand. but we are making an honest effort to ensure that the next session of parliament will be an orderly session. we have important legislations apart from the budget to put before parliament and talks are going on with the opposition parties to ensure that whatever our differences, parliament should be allowed to function normally., so i would wish to mention to you that in reporting the affairs of our nation, we mustn’t focus excessively on the negative features important though it is that the government should deal with them, to take effective action and you have my assurance that wherever such corrective action is required, our government will take that action and will bring the wrong doers to book. with these words, i once again welcome you to this session of interaction. the media has, as i said, a very important role to play in a functioning democracy that india is and let us work together to revitalize the spirit of rejuvenation, spirit of self confidence that we have problems, but we also have credible mechanisms to overcome them. we shall overcome, we shall prevail. we will provide our country a functioning effective government and that’s what i wanted to say in the very beginning now the floor is entirely yours., question and answer session., q.1 aaj tak arun purie : mr. prime minister, thank you for inviting us for the interaction. i hope you have more of them. i am sorry to take you back to the 2g scam although you have said that it should not be a scam oriented coverage and you have taken some very positive steps and as you have just assured us that you will get the wrong doers of the 2g scam. just for my better understanding of how we got into this situation, you had warned mr. raja in november 2007 to consider ing auction of the 2g spectrum at 2007 rates and he actually disregarded your advice. and later on in 2008 the companies which got the spectrum sold it for large sums of money, the values which are in the public domain. inspite of all this you appointed him again as the telecom minister. what was your thinking behind this?, ans pm: let me first deal with what i said to mr. raja in a letter that i wrote to him on 2nd of november 2007. i mentioned in that letter number of concerns which were being expressed, some in the press, some telecom companies used to come and mention to me. i listed a number of issues and i said to him that you must look into these issues and ensure that they are dealt with in a fair, equitable and transparent manner. one of the issues that i asked him to look into was the possibility from legal and technical angle of having an auction of spectrum. mr. raja wrote back to me almost on the same day, or our letters crossed. he said, i have been absolutely transparent in my dealings, i will be so in the future, and you have my assurance that i have done nothing and will do nothing which will not be consistent with the promise that i am making., now as far as auction is concerned, he came back to me and said auction is something which has not been suggested by trai, also not suggested by the telecom commission and he also said that if we have an auction, it would not give a level playing field for the new comers, because the existing players have got their spectrum free of charge of about 10 megahertz. therefore he said the trai’s advice, telecom commission’s advice and his own view was that auctions are not the way forward at least for 2g spectrum and he also mentioned in a subsequent letter that he is agreeable to auction of 3g spectrum. but with regard to 2g spectrum, he was very clear that he should stay with the then existing approach., and this was also discussed with the finance ministry because in terms of the cabinet decision of 2003 the pricing and allocation of spectrum was to be settled between the ministry of finance and the telecom dept. initially, of course, the finance ministry did ask for a high price of spectrum but after many discussions, the two ministries agreed that as far as 2g is concerned, we have to live with the present system particularly with regard to the amount of spectrum that is built and embedded into a license agreement. so this is the background why i did not proceed further with this matter of pricing of spectrum, because if the ministry of finance and ministry of telecom both agree and they have the obligation of the cabinet decision of 2003 to decide on the matter and also since trai is an expert body and telecom commission has experts, if all of them are of the same view, i did not feel i was in a position to insist that auctions must be insisted., 1 a) supplementary q: sale of spectrum 2 companies even before roll out, a scam was staring everybody in the face …?, ans pm: i do not know, frankly speaking what was the motivation of people who got spectrum but i know that as far as the basic policy is concerned, that i thought was as it was then the prevailing practice and raja was continuing that policy, that as far as who gets licenses, the first come first serve policy, how it was implemented, that was never discussed with me. licenses was not matter which got referred to me or to the cabinet that was the decision exclusively of the telecom minister. now subsequent events have shown that companies sold their equity but i was told that they had not sold it to shareholders. they have sold it in a manner to dilute the equity of the promoters. now if they have to roll out they require money, and that money can be raised either by way of borrowings, or by way of diluting equity by getting in more people. therefore at that stage i did not think that i should intervene in that affair., the other thing that you have mentioned about mr. raja being inducted into the cabinet, i cannot divulge what went on in the processes of cabinet formation but i would like to mention that we are a coalition government. in a coalition government, you can suggest your preferences but you have to go by what the leader of that particular coalition party ultimately insists. and mr. raja along with mr. maran was the choice of the dmk party. and as of that moment, i had no reason, frankly speaking, to feel that anything seriously wrong had been done. and therefore i did not feel that i had the authority to object to mr. raja’s entry because i quite honestly in may 2009, although complaints were coming from all sides, and some were from those companies which had not benefitted, some were from those which had benefitted but not benefitted adequately and therefore i was not in a position to make up my mind that anything seriously was wrong with mr. raja’s doing at that time., q 2. asianet - prashant raghuvamsam - 5 states are going for elections soon. and you are back from kerala, what is the feedback about the chances for your party in kerala? and another question one of the hot subjects is corruption in judiciary, there are allegations even against a former chief justice. justice krishna iyer says that you are silent on this matter. how will you react to this?, ans pm: i just come back from kerala. i do believe that the congress party has a very good chance to return to power. winds of change are blowing that way and i hope this change will materialise. with regard to corruption in judiciary, corruption in any walk of life, whether it is in judiciary, executive, legislature, should be a matter of concern to all thinking people in our country and therefore i am second to none, in saying that if there is corruption, whether it is in judiciary, or in executive or in other walks of life, we must get rid of that., q 3. bloomberg-utv, pranjal sharma –no positive, constructive economic agenda– what ever steps are being taken are being stalled at the parliament level, stalled by the states or by the opposition parties or even in some cases by industry. no big reformist wave coming from upa2. have we lost the will to take hard reformist decisions?, ans pm: no way, we have not lost the will. we will persist. there are difficulties when parliament is not allowed to function. when the opposition led states for example do not wish to cooperate over path breaking reforms ushering in single goods and services tax. this is the reform which is needed. this would make our tax system if the reform comes about, an envy of the world. but the opposition parties, particularly, the bjp has taken a hostile attitude and the reasons that have been given, frankly i cannot mention it in public, they say because you have taken some decision against a particular person, who was a minister in gujarat, we must reverse it, i don’t want to add further., the economic agenda is there. we are for example working on a food security bill, the right to education act is now a reality, the icds reform is a reality. there have been reforms in the national rural health mission. same way, we are going to have a fresh wave of infrastructure investment, with the help of the new ppp model. these are not big reforms. and i sincerely hope that in this current budget, you will see a clearer picture of the reform agendas that our government has. we have not given up, we will persist, when there are difficulties, and particularly when parliament is not allowed to function, i think parliament is not able to perform its essential function, being a forum for legislation, you all would agree that that’s one area where our nation has to rethink how our parliamentary institutions should function., q -4 cnn-ibn rajdeep sardesai you have said that you would like the parliament to resume functioning in an orderly manner. are you therefore, on your own part ready to agree to the opposition’s demand for joint parliament committee into the 2g scam, because there is feeling that there was a reluctance both on your part and the part of the government because you did not want to appear in front of a jpc in the context of the 2g scam and as a supplementary through these months of scams tainted have your ever thought of quitting or actually being so frustrated that you feel that your are surrounded by a lot of corrupt people in your cabinet and therefore have you every thought of throwing your hands up and saying that enough is enough?, pm ans - while you have raised about my opposition to the jpc of being afraid to appear before it. i am not afraid of appearing before any committee. the pac is a joint parliamentary committee presided over by a very senior member of the opposition. i have publicly declared that i am willing to appear before the pac. so i am not afraid of appearing before any committee including a jpc. and this is entirely a wrong impression that i was the one who was blocking the agreement about the jpc because i did not want to appear before the jpc. i have always said that as prime minister my conduct must be like caesar’s wife above suspicion and i am quite prepared to appear before any committee that may go into this., q-4 a) supplementary – did you at any stage think of quitting…?, ans pm - no, q 4-b) supplementary and would you concede that there are a lot of corrupt people in your government and you are not able to act against and that led you to believe that enough is enough?, ans pm i think in a coalition government there is a coalition dharma and obliviously the things are not entirely the way i would like them to be but quite frankly i have never felt like resigning because i have a job to do. the country voted our party to be the leader of the upa coalition and we have a lot of unfinished business to accomplish and therefore i have never thought in terms of giving up half way and i will stay the course., q 5 al jajira, prerna suri - i would like to talk about current unrest in the middle east. do you have any worries that the unrest is seen in the middle east right now might resurface here in india in any rest of regions be that j&k, in north east, or any other areas under maoists rebels as well and my supplementary is also that that the arab world is witnessing a revolution at the moment, do you support the new movements that new are coming up in iran, in yemen, in algeria or bahrain?, pm ans - well, whatever happens in the gulf or west asia including the countries that you have mentioned is a matter of concern to us. we have five million indians working in the gulf countries and if peace is not prevalent, if orderly processes of the management of the economy and polity break down that could affects this vital community to indian citizens who are working and contributing to the development of the countries of west asia. now the other questioned you have asked that there is a danger something like that happening in india, no, because india is a functioning democracy, people already have a right to change governments, we have a free press, i think even when that the government didn’t agree, i think, they are free, absolutely free to pursue what the path that they want to pursue and therefore there is not question the thing that have happened in egypt or in other arab countries can be replicated in india., q 5 a) supplementary – and sir, do you support the current revolution in middle east?, pm ans - let me say if the people of egypt want to move towards the processes of democratization, they have our good wishes. and that’s true of all countries. we have a functioning democracy, do we do not believe it is our business to advise other countries, we welcome the dawn of democracy everywhere., q 6. doordarshan -neelam sharma kehte hai ki girte hain shah sawar maidane jang me, wo tifal kya girenge jo ghutno ke bal chale. sarkar ki apni chunauti hain aur sarkar un chunautiyon se nipatne ki puri koshish bhi kar rahi hai aur bhrashtachar aapki is samay sabse bari chunauti bani hui hai lekin log yah dekhna chahti hai ki bhrashtachariyon ko saja mile log ye chahte hain ki wo apne jiwan kal me aisa hote huye dekhe. kya aapko nahi lagta ki ye is samay iss sandesh ko dene ki sarkar ki sabse bari jarurat hai., pm ans – main aapke madhyam se bharat ki janta ko yah wada deta hu ki hum puri koshish karenge ki jo logo ne kuchh galat baat ki hai unko jaroor unki kari saja milni chahiye., q 7. e tv, sriharsha – as a question about this telangana a vexed problem – it has been lingering for quite sometime and there is a complain that congress seems to be undecided on the issue. and where does the congress stand on this, and what about the government policy because the srikishna committee has submitted its report. till now the process of dialogue is continuing but no decision has been taken yet., pm ans – i think this is a complicated issue and we are trying to evolve a consensus. the home minister has one round of meeting with all the political parties, he will call these political parties again because the first round was just handling over them the srikrishna committee report. now they are studying it . after that will come the phase of consultation with all political parties who are active in andhra pradesh, that process will must be allowed to be pursued to its logical conclusion., q 7-a) supplementary - if there is no consensus mr. prime minister, what will be the government’s stand?, pm ans – i cannot answer the hypothetical question, we will cross the bridge when we come to it., q 8. kolkata tv, subhashish moitra : sir for last few months, upa has been facing two major issues i.e. price rise and corruption. my question a)can it affect the alliance and can it break the upa alliance from within and b) is there any chance of having relations with the left?, pm ans - i think, the left is no longer a part of our coalition so i don’t know how to answer your question. as far as coalition partners presently are concerned i think, ours is a strong coalition. our allies are as committed to strengthening the hands of coalition government as anybody else so there is no danger that there might be inner tensions which might lead to break up of this coalition. we are a strong government, we are a strong coalition and our coalition partners are with us…., q- 9 cnbc awaz sanjay pugalia, : long term fund ki jarurat hai infrastructure ke liye, kafi dino se discuss hua hai ki kuchh karenge, lekin sabse jis growth ki baat apne abhi baat ki kuchh inflation hum isliye allow karenge kyonki growth chahiye to ye pending agenda hai. kuchh specific kadam udhane ja rage hai aap jisase ki long term funding ho sake jo ki hamare recourses aur banking se to nahi ho paya., pm ans – we must i think create a viable corporate debt market. i think that’s the direction in which we must move. the other is to mobilize funds from outside. i think, there has been a discussion about the creation about infrastructure development fund. some discussions are going on and most probably the finance minister will outline something in that direction., q-9 a) supplementary – inflation ke issue pe agriculture ka doosra structructural reform jo aapne 1991 me silsila shuru kiya wo overdue hai bahut ruka hua hai, batchit to hui hai uspar, kuchh concrete measures aap karayiye uske bagair nahi hoga!, pm ans – the basic issue there is the reform of the marketing system, now this is in the domain of the state governments, and we have been discussion with the state governments, with the chief ministers that they should do something in that area. it is an essay in persuasion, and somewhere we are succeeding, and some we are not succeeding. so we must persist that’s the only way in federal polity that we are to move forward., q 10. ndtv pronoy roy, : you have now three and half years to go for next election. normally the first period after election is a honeymoon period and most enjoyable and most decisions are taken. its not been the case it has been pretty tough year and a half. you are facing a kind of double incumbency going to the next election. attacks from opposition and a lot of random attack from your party as well. double incumbency is the worst way to face the second election. opposition attacks you cannot control but within your party does it sadden you to see these attacks repeatedly happening popping up. would you be happy to be a prime ministerial candidate if asked in the next elections…., pm ans – well, it is too early we have still to long way. i have to complete this term. as far as next term is concerned it is too premature from me to speculate who will be the candidate., i would of course to like a cohesive party to back the government and i do not get a feeling that that cohesion does not exist. i think we are a democratic party, we have a lot of internal discussions. when decisions are taken, i think, our party stands united in support of the government., q 10 a) supplementary – you are talking about unfair criticism of lame duck and the sense of drift that you the most honest prime minister are surrounded by a very dishonest administration. how will you change this drift. are you going to have a major reshuffle?, pm ans : well, i have said that after the budget session of parliament is over, there will be a restructuring – a reshuffle of the cabinet. i hope and i think i will get back to the task once the budget session of parliament is over., q 11. news 24, anuradha prasad : on the consensus with opposition of jpc. …. will the budget session be smooth unlike the last session., pm ans – puri puri koshish ki ja rahi hai ki koi na koi rasta nikal jaye aur mujhe asha hai ki aisa sambhaw ho sakta hai., supplementary – on the cricket world cup – and your favourite player., pm ans – i am one with the wishes of my country men and women, that india should win this world cup. i would not like to say that i choose among the players but i have some preferences, which i would not like to mention., q 12. cnn, sara sidner :on food inflation versus gdp of say 8.5%., pm ans – let me say that the food inflation certainly hurts the poor. the poor labourers spend nearly 60 percent of their income on food items and therefore the food price rise disproportionately that does hurt the poor most. now at the same time you must appreciate we have put in place a social safety net. the biggest single social safety net is the mahatma gandhi national rural employment guarantee programme which guarantees to each labourer who offers himself for employment a daily wage of rs. 100/- to which we have said that we will adjust this wage with every rise in the consumer price index. so therefore i think, although the inflation does hurt, we have put in place social safety net which was not there six years before and that does not mean that we should not work together to improve i think the situation. further more, i would like to mention that as far as the food grains distributed through public distribution system is concerned there has been no change in prices since year 2002. in the last eight years we have kept these prices constant so therefore where the public distribution system operates together with the real wage protection in view of the inflationary trends, these are the two most important means in which we are trying to insulate the poor from the ill effects of food inflation., q 13 new live 24/7, zarir hussein – on north east peace process. is the government of india committed to a time bound solution to ulfa problem…. nscn talks have been going on for 14 years without tangible results. … your thoughts on assam election due in two months., pm ans - i think, our government in assam has done very well. the fact that peace process is also going forward is an added factor which would strengthen the ruling party in assam. as far as the fixing of a time limit is concerned i think the process has just started. it would bring me greatest happiness if we can say that we can complete it immediately but i know that we are dealing with a difficult problem. it is an essay in mutual comprehension. we have just now started talking to ulfa, they came and called on me and i am very happy with what they told me and i assured them that the government of india is absolutely serious to find an honorable solution to the all these issues but it would be wrong on my part to say that right now i can fix the time limit that will be our effort., q 13 a) supplementary – will congress make a hat-trick in assam., pm ans - i hope, i think they do., q 14. – upedra rai, sahara samay – on goms decision to abolish minister’s discretionary quota. how will you do that., pm ans – ye issue ek hai jo congress president ne apne bhashan me aur all india congress committee ke session me is baat ki charcha ki thi un tamam wishayo par batchit karne ke liye humne ek group of minister ko ye kam saumpa hai aur pranb mukherjee uske chairman hai aur ek issue usme ye bhi hai ki jo discretionary powers ministers ke hai unko khatam kiya jaye. unhe iss baat par wichar karna hoga ki kya kuchh kiya ja sakta hai kya kuchh kiya nahi ja sakta hia. abhi saat ( sixty) din unko diye gaya hai report dene ke liye. main us report ka intezaar kar raha hu., q- 14 a) supplementary – on fall in fdi. kahan galti hui., pm ans – galti hamari nahi huyi. international environment aisa hai ki funds, un dino me tamam emerging markets se fund kuchh wapas gaye hai. – we are today functioning in an environment where what happens outside affects us. and therefore, it is not easy to say that what happens to the fund flow is entirely a function of our policy. it is also a function of what policies our other friends particularly the developed countries adopt and it is that process that is…. but i do agree that we need to strengthen our resolve to create a favourable environment for larger flow of fund from aboard., q 15. shahi zamam, star news : on moral responsibility towards corruption charges on the government., pm ans – mujhe apni jimmedari ka ehsaas hai. isme aapko koi shak nahi hona chahiye. lekin meri kuchh majbooriya bhi hai, coalition politics me bahut kuchh sahna parta hai. ya to phir ye ho ki yaha har 6 mahine me naye election karaye jaye. aisa bhi karna uchit nahi hoga. so some comprises have to be made in managing a coalition government and those issues therefore have to be used in the context in which no single party, i think, emerges which can rule by itself., q 15 a) supplementary – have you every felt that the present politics is not suitable to your nature as a large part of your life has been outside it., pm ans - bahut si chijen hai jo mere mizaz ke sath milti nahi hain. i have looked upon life as one long continues learning and relearning process and for me i think it has been a great educational experience, from civil service, from academic world to the political world i think it is a process of learning and i certainly relish that experience., q 16. arnab goswami, times now – on compromise with corruption because of coalition ; on devas deal – delayed action – backroom talks in pm’s office ., pm ans – there have been no backroom talks. i think i have not met anybody myself and the decision of the space commission to annul the deal was taken on 2nd july, 2010. space commission took a number of decision of which annulment of the contract was one of them. the dept of space was asked to take action on all the five decision points that emerged from the space commission meeting. the issue of how to annul the contract required consideration by legal experts and the law ministry was consulted. a decision had to be taken on whether to annul the contract using article 7(c) or article 11 or both read together. eventually it has been decided that the government should take a sovereign policy decision regarding the utilization of space band capacity which uses s band spectrum having regard to the country’s strategic requirements., i would like to mention that although the space commission took a decision to annul the contract in july 2010, the actual cabinet note was received from the deptt of space in the pmo only in november 2010. and even then there was a number of consultations to polish it up. at the most you can say that between november and now the prime minister’s office has got this note ready for the cabinet. decision has been taken now but it requires consultations. (intervention) - after the receipt of the note for the cabinet from the dept of space for preparation of the cabinet note a number of ministries were consulted and the dept of space itself took six revisions of the note before finally submitting it for approval., it is certainly true that a number of letters were received by members of space commission including officials in the pmo from devas after august 2010 including as late as a few days ago. letters were also received in the pmo from the us chamber of commerce but no action was taken on any of these letters which were merely filed. at no stage was dept of space asked by the pmo to comment on the points made in the letters. they have no impact whatsoever on the processing of the case. on the contrary, the pmo followed up its verbal reminders to dept of space by sending a letter to the dept of space in october 2010 seeking a status of follow up of the decision taken by the space commission in its july 2010 meeting., the matter was never raised by the german minister of foreign affairs during his meeting with me in new delhi on 18 october. i think some people have reported that the german foreign minister raised it with me. the meeting did take place but he never mentioned anything. it is a fact that the meetings did take place between devas and officials of the dept of space, isro and antrix after july last year since the agreement had not actually been annulled. but no further actions were taken by the deptt of space or isro to implement the agreement. no assurance was given in contravention of the recommendations of the space commission. though there has been some delay in processing which were only procedural., the fact is that the contract was not operational in any practical sense and there was no question of diluting in any way the recommendations of the space commission. all the consultations are now almost complete. the ministries concerned have all had the opportunity to express their views as is required before having policy decisions taken by the government at the level of the cabinet, and also because this issue concerns many other ministries apart from the dept. of space. these include deptt of telecommunation, defence, home, finance and law. the matter is expected to be put before cabinet committee on security for its final decision. that’s the state of the affairs. there have been no effort in the prime minister’s office to dilute, in any way the decision taken by the space commission in july 2010. on that i would like to assure you and through you i would like to assure the country., q 17 ramakrishnan, suntv : on fishermen issue with srilankan government., pm ans – i have been told that about 118 fishermen have been taken into custody. we are taking up this matter with the sri lankan government. we take a very serious view. i think only earlier in this month, the foreign secretary to make a strong demarche …..this kind of behaviour is not acceptable among neighbouring countries., qn. tamil nadu is going for assembly elections. what is your assessment on tn elections., pm: i am not an astrologer but i do hope that the ruling coalition will win., q 18 sanjay majumdar – bbc – british aid – why do we still need the international aid., pm ans : india still is a poor country. and it is certainly true if aid is not forthcoming we will not collapse but i think we have the capacity to make good use of development assistance and if some friendly country offers large amount of money by way of concessional development support, i don’t see reason why we should decline to accept., q 18 a) supplementary question – image of india taken a beating after the scams., pm: let me say that this sort of atmosphere is not good. it saps our own self confidence, it also spoils the image of india and therefore i urge each one of you that in reporting these events, while opinions are a matter of speculation, facts are sacred. and facts should not be distorted. opinions, you can freely express views, which are one’s held convictions, but we owe it to our country that when it comes to reporting country’s affairs, atleast when it comes to dealing with the facts, they should be as objective as is possible., q 19. satish k. singh, zee news. aapne yeh press conference kyon bulayi? brashtachar ke mudde pe aap bahut serious hai. lok pal, black money, state funding of elections. malam in budget. will you accept any of your mistakes., pm ans : a group of ministers is looking into all aspects of how to deal with corruption. also it is not certainly true that we have not dealt with black money problem, the effort is on to sign treaties or to revise treaties which would enable us to get information from the affected countries where this money is stored. we will take all possible measures to control this menace of black money, to bring back to our country the money which is legally ours., q 19) cnn ibn – rajdeep sardesai home minister spoke of the governance deficit, your telecom minister spoke of zero revenue loss on 2g, these are two statements. where do you stand in the 2g scam, where do you stand on the home minister’s governance deficit statement., pm ans : obviously if the events have taken place, they do bring out the weaknesses in the governance, or you may call them ethical deficit, i don’t deny that we need to improve the quality of governance that’s not a subject which divides me and other members of the cabinet. with regard to the loss of revenues, it is very much dependent on what is your starting point. there are various estimates, but you have to assess what is the right magnitude after asking yourself what was the right price. now, i have explained to you that the then existing policy of the government was that auctions should not take place. and if auctions are not taking place then what is the basis for you to calculate a loss. i am not in a position to say that there is a foolproof method in which one can determine the extent of the loss. it is very much a function of what is your starting point. and also depends upon our opinion we have a budget which gives subsidy for food, 80,000 crores per annum, some people may say these foodgrains should be sold at market place. will we say then because they are not sold at market prices, because you are giving them a subsidy, it is a loss of 80,000 crores. we give subsidy to fertilisers which cost about 60,000 crores every year people can say that these fertilisers should be priced at the market rate, would you then say that there is a loss of revenue of 60,000 crores in fertilisers sale. we subsidise the price of kerosene to an extent which is greater than many other subsidies, that imposes burden on our oil marketing companies, should we say then that because we give subsidy for kerosene sales under public distribution, that there is loss of revenue., q 19 a) are you disagreeing with what cag said, or are you agreeing with what your telecom minister has said., pm ans : i think the cag himself has said that it is presumptive loss. and therefore, it depends upon which assumptions you make. i would not like to intervene., q 20. times now, arnab goswami in october you said 90 days for cwg probe, it is now more than 90 days. do you feel disappointed with the progress of the cwg probe., pm ans : we are trying our very best but we had to go through the due process of law. we are a country where the rule of law prevails, sometimes, it is very frustrating that it takes time. but you have my assurance that wrong doers will not escape this time., q 21. ndtv pronoy roy it is very difficult to calculate the loss. there is subsidy in the allocation of 2g licences. do you think it should have been an auction., pm ans : i think you have to take a decision at that particular time. of all the decisions that i take, it is 7 out of 10 turn out to be correct. the shareholders of a normal corporation will say a job well done. we are living in a world of uncertainty. many things ex-ante you think do not turn out to be ex-post. therefore there is a gap between ex-ante thinking and what has emerged as a reality

2011-02-25,"9 p.c. growth next fiscal, unrest in middle-east, inflation dampeners: survey","inflation will remain a priority for the government which projected over 9 per cent economic growth in the next fiscal even as downside risks emerge from rising oil prices due to turmoil in the middle-east., the economic survey 2010-11, tabled in the lok sabha by finance minister pranab mukherjee, said tight monetary policies would have to stay to curb inflation and mitigate global risks such as rising food and commodity prices and debt problems in the european nations., ahead of the general budget, the survey made out a case for gradual exit of stimulus provided to the industry to combat the impact of the global financial crisis in 2008-09., insisting that the inflation is clearly the “dominant” concern, the survey said “current growth and inflation trend warrant persistence with an anti-inflationary monetary stance”. consolidation of fiscal deficit would also be essential to check the price rise, it added., “inflation is a matter of great concern, no doubt. just one year ago in february 2010 food inflation was as high as 20.2 per cent...though it is high but it has come down in january...still it is an area of concern and we shall have to work on it, particularly in the context of global economic crisis,” mr. mukherjee told reporters after tabling the survey., the survey, considered a report card on the economy, listed rising international oil prices and sovereign debt problems in the euro zone and the political turmoil in the middle-east as the downside risks for the indian economy., higher current account deficit due to impact of fragile global recovery on indian exports and increasing domestic consumption was listed as an area of concern., “the problem may be further aggravated by the rising international oil prices,” it added., for the current fiscal, the survey said, the economy would grow by 8.6 per cent, up from 8 per cent a year ago. “it is expected that the growth will breach the 9 per cent mark in 2011-12,” reaching the pre-crisis levels., the survey also suggested a set of reforms, including streamlining of land acquisition and environmental clearance norms, to expedite infrastructure projects, a crucial driver of growth., besides, it also pitched for opening of the foreign direct investment (fdi) in multi-brand retail starting with metro cities. “fdi in retail may help bring in technical knowhow to set up efficient supply chains which could act as models of development,” the survey., it also pressed for reforms in banking and insurance sector., the survey suggested private participation in social sectors such as health and education in the form of public-social-private-partnership to supplement the government efforts., india, the survey said, needs a policy to bring another round of multifaceted reforms for the industrial sector to have a sustained double-digit output growth in the medium to long term., in the short-term, the sector is likely to grow at moderate but sustainable rate. however, increasing cost of financing and slowdown in foreign equity inflows in the current financial year are causes for concern., “over the medium to long term, to sustain double-digits output growth and reduce the vulnerabilities of the sector, there is a need to put in place a policy framework for embarking on another round of multifaceted reforms,” it said., it also pitched for giving banking licences to industrial houses wanting to set up banks to promote the goal of financial inclusion., “as regards allowing industrial houses, business houses and nbfcs to promote banks, they may be allowed full banking license with provision for avoiding conflict of interest issues,” it said., on india’s exports, it said that shipments will surpass the $ 200 billion target for the current fiscal and the gradual roll-back of stimulus measures is not likely to impact growth of the country’s overseas shipments., on insurance, it said that there will be different set of norms for life and non-life insurance companies for coming out with a public float., “it is proposed that the disclosure requirements for life and non-life companies would be separately mandated given the nature of their respective business,” the survey said., it added that investors would be required to be made aware of the financial performance, company profile, financial position, risk exposure, corporate governance and management of these companies., to contain excessive flow of foreign capital, it said that india should work closely with g-20 countries to take collective steps., “we will have to keep open the options of having to take corrective measures, should these flows affect us adversely. the most important step in this context is to work with the g-20 countries and try to figure out collective decision rules, whereby each country tries to intervene minimally in the flow of capital,” the pre-budget survey said., it further said, “when it does intervene, it does so taking into account the externalities on other nations.”, the continuing debt turmoil in the euro zone area could have adverse fallout on the indian economy, hurting its capital flows as well as exports, it added., the economic survey pegged the fiscal deficit for 2010-11 at 4.8 per cent, lower than the budgetary estimates of 5.5 per cent, on the back of higher realisation from 3g spectrum auction and buoyancy in revenues., india’s fiscal deficit had ballooned to 6.3 per cent of the gdp in 2009-10 in view of stimulus spending worth billions of dollars to combat global financial meltdown, and was pegged at 5.5 per cent for the current fiscal., calling for bold reforms in the power sector, the economic survey asked the states to reduce subsidies and cross-subsidies on electricity and hike tariffs., india currently has one of the lowest and most uneconomical average electricity tariffs in the world -- 8 cents per unit at the retail level, compared to about 12-15 cents in countries endowed with more coal or gas and 19-10 cents per unit elsewhere, it said., on agriculture, it said that special efforts are required to promote production and productivity of all coarse cereals to ensure food and nutritional security of india., “there is every reason to promote the production of coarse cereals particularly in the rain-fed areas by increasing investment in research and the schemes,” the survey tabled in parliament by mr. pranab mukherjee said., further it warned that india, despite being the world’s largest producer, could become a net importer of milk in next decade if the growth in the sector is not accelerated to 5.5 per cent annually.",0.049366843033509696,"9 p.c. growth next fiscal , unrest

2011-03-01,union budget,"the union budget 2011-12 is indeed lacklustre, as pointed out in the editorial (march 1). although finance minister pranab mukherjee has announced new initiatives to increase the supply of specific food items such as edible oil, vegetables, pulses, and milk, the introduction of one per cent excise duty on about 100 items — mainly fast moving consumer items — will only trigger inflation and price rise. at a time when the aam aadmi is reeling under the impact of price rise, the budget ought to have addressed his bread and butter issues., b. suresh kumar, coimbatore, higher income tax relief to those above 80 years of age is a joke because there is little likelihood of many beneficiaries in this category. they would either have no earnings at all or would be affluent enough not to bother about paying tax. the budget has done a great disservice to the middle income group by bringing the diagnostic service under the tax net., a. thirugnanasambantham, coimbatore, lowering the qualifying age for senior citizens from 65 to 60, raising the income tax exemption limit for individuals from rs.1.6 lakh to rs.1.8 lakh for men, to rs.2.5 lakh from rs.2.4 lakh to senior citizens and the higher exemption limit of rs.5 lakh for very senior citizens aged 80 and above are welcome. but women have been neglected. heavens wouldn't have fallen had the income tax exemption limit for women been raised to rs.2 lakh., c.v. nirmalarajan, chennai, the budget has ignored senior citizens whose income is low. the senior citizens savings scheme was started in 2004 with an interest rate of nine per cent per annum. it remains unchanged. many senior citizens who depend on this scheme for their income were eagerly expecting a revision., surya k. narayanan, secunderabad, consider the tasks facing our education system before buying the argument that the allocation for education is set to receive a boost. more than three crore children have not even stepped into schools, and a huge majority of the existing schools are in a dilapidated condition without toilets, drinking water and sufficient teachers., the 12 per cent enrolment speaks volumes of governments' past performance in higher education. now, with an apparent increase of allocation, with the current state of rising inflation and when the government is vigorously promoting the all-out privatisation and commercialisation of education, will the budget really give a boost to education?, m.n. sriram, bangalore, i do not think the budget was disappointing. rather than playing to the gallery, it aims at consolidation and growth. it endeavours to achieve a nine per cent gdp growth. subsidies for farmers, economic help to people below the poverty line, incentive for health and education sectors, liberalisation of fdis, increase in it exemption limits, reduction in the prices of common use consumer items, making luxury more expensive are all indicators of growth for the larger good. a budget must allow the previous year's plans to be implemented. it cannot be different every year. in that light, the present budget is continuation of a positive process which needs to be boosted., colonel r.d. singh, ambala, the budget has nothing in it to be hailed as reformist as it has failed to fulfil the expectations of the corporate people. but it has set aside a significant

(s/nf) it looks like we're getting to crunch time here in nepal. the maoists are still stringing along talks with the gon, hoping that the gon will follow up on its past four months of unilateral concessions by caving in and allowing an armed maoist movement into an interim government. the prime minister assures me that he has no intention of doing that. if he does not, then the maoists appear intent on organizing during the month of october massive public demonstrations designed to pressure the gon into putting the maoists on the path to power. if the government still refuses to cave, the maoists, according to a number of pretty good sources, seem ready to move in november to a campaign of urban violence, using the demonstrations as cover. again, the goal of the violence would be to intimidate the government into handing over the keys to power., a tremendous bluff?, -------------------, 2. (c) the good news is that the maoists are doing much of this through bluff. they have relatively little popular support, and they have nowhere near the military capability to take on the government's security services in an open fight. the bad news is that the bluff may work. the prime minister is desperate to avoid being blamed for being the one who derailed the peace process. just as important, the home minister, who also happens to be the government's chief negotiator with the maoists, fears that enforcement of the law against them could lead to the insurgents walking away from the negotiating table. thus, the police are standing aside while the maoists engage in extortion, intimidation, kidnapping, and the occasional murder -- as well as preparing for their october push against the government. the government inaction is leading many nepalis, particularly in kathmandu, to think that a maoist victory is inevitable., what we need to do, ------------------, 3. (c) brow-beating: ultimately, decisions made by nepalis will determine whether this country goes down the path toward becoming a people's republic over the next couple of months. that said, we need to increase the possibility that the leaders here will make the right decisions. i've been meeting regularly with the prime minister, urging him (so far unsuccessfully) to use the police to enforce law and order and bucking him up to stick to his bottom line of not letting gun-toting maoists into the government (with greater success so far). we've also been pushing the other major parties of the seven party alliance to support the prime minister on arms management and to push him to use the police against maoist excesses. i've also created a firestorm of controversy by visiting a couple of military bases (as well as a lot of civilians) out west and publicly condemning maoist violence. leftist mp's have called for my expulsion, but at least some of the people here are beginning to debate maoist intentions., 4. (s/nf) preparing for the worst: we need to be prepared for the possibility of a maoist return to violence in november. the key will be to condemn as quickly as possible maoist violence, while shipping as quickly as possible some 4,500 more weapons that we have in storage for the nepali army. those weapons would have an immediate tactical impact but more importantly would shore up a government that will be under tremendous pressure to capitulate., 5. (s/nf) the diplomatic game: the diplomacy here is getting complicated. the europeans are all over the map with respect to recent developments. the danes and norwegians (who have some clout here because of their aid programs) are convinced that lasting peace is just about ready to break out and push the gon to be as accommodating as possible. the brits, in contrast, seem convinced that the maoists will soon be coming into power and are trying to convince themselves that that might not be so bad. the chinese seem primarily interested in pushing tibet issues with the weak, frequently ineffectual gon. the local world bank rep is so fed up with the corruption in the system that he has become a frequent lunch pal of the maoist supremo. i'm trying to push back here on some of this, but it would help if the department could have a serious, high-level discussion with the brits on nepal. we might also want to look at a demarche to the europeans and others (reminding them that the maoists are not just agrarian reformers and seem to want power rather than peace). and finally..., working with india, ------------------, 6. (s/nf) from my perspective, we need to do more to keep the indians in lock-step with us. i coordinate closely with my indian counterpart here and in private he pushes the exact same message i do: that the police need to enforce law and order and that the gon should not let armed maoists into an interim government. i was more than a little annoyed to find out, however, that the indian embassy had complained to the pm's office about our training activities with the nepal army. (the indian ambassador assured me that the message had been that those exchanges should occur more quietly and had been delivered without instructions from new delhi.) the incident underscored the fact that, while worried about current trends, new delhi seems oblivious to how close the maoists are getting to victory here. that makes sense: new delhi godfathered the working relationship between the maoists and the parties and doesn't want to acknowledge that it might have created a frankenstein's monster. moreover, india's marxist party (a key supporter of the governing coalition) has proclaimed that everything here is going just fine. in that context, i hope that a discussion on nepal will feature prominently in future conversations with senior indian leaders., comment, -------",0.04517442062622786,79370 : crunch time nepal ?,"79370 9/22/2006 11 : 26 06kathmandu2587 embassy kathmandu secret//noforn "" vzczcxyz0064oo ruehwebde ruehkt #2587/01 2651126zny sssss zzho 221126z sep 06fm amembassy kathmanduto ruehc/secstate washdc immediate 3260info ruehbj/amembassy beijing immediate 4805ruehlm/amembassy colombo immediate 5034ruehcp/amembassy copenhagen immediate 0329ruehka/amembassy dhaka immediate 0184ruehlo/amembassy london immediate 4428ruehne/amembassy new delhi immediate 0264ruehny/amembassy oslo immediate 0245ruehko/amembassy tokyo immediate 0988rhhmuna/cdr uspacom honolulu hi immediaterhehnsc/nsc washdc immediaterueaiia/cia washdc immediaterhefdia/dia washdc immediateruekjcs/secdef washdc immediaterucndt/usmission usun new york immediate 1963 "" "" e c r e kathmandu 002587 , sipdis , noforn sipdis , dept , p , sca ambassador , e.o. 12958 : decl : 09/22/2016 tags : pgov , prel , pter , , np subject : crunch time nepal? , classified : ambassador james f. moriarty , reasons 1.4 ( b/d ) . , 1.

interaction with visiting indian journalists here, mr. sharma said it was important that india should become a manufacturing base for defence equipment and for that to happen the fdi needs to be encouraged. ``it is time to bring in high end technologies in the defence sector to meet our needs and to become net exporters of this equipment in the future. we are holding consultations and a group

to effectively replace imports, estimated at over $8 billion., mr. sharma said the paper circulated by the department of industrial policy and promotion (dipp) was receiving feedback from various

2011-04-04,fdi policy: opening the floodgates,"in a quiet move that constitutes one more step in its long-term effort to dismantle regulation of foreign direct investment in the country, the government has advanced the process of liberalisation quite significantly. it has decided to drop the condition inadequately defined in its press release as the need for “prior approval in case of existing joint ventures/technical collaborations in the ‘same field’”., this opaque statement needs clarification. prior to the recently issued circular 1 of 2011 from the department of industrial policy and promotion of the ministry of industry, any foreign investor who had entered into a joint venture, technology transfer or trademark agreement with an indian partner prior to january 12, 2005, had to obtain special approval from the government before undertaking any new independent investment or entering into a new technology transfer or trademark agreement with a different partner in the same field. when doing so, the foreign investor and/or the existing partner had to establish that the new proposal “would not jeopardize the existing joint venture or technology transfer/trademark partner”., the importance of this clause needs to be emphasised. when in the early post-independence years the government pressured foreign firms into entering into collaboration with indian partners rather than setting up wholly owned subsidiaries or affiliate firms, there were two important factors, among others, that motivated it. the first was the need to strengthen the still young and inadequately experienced industrialist class in india, by mediating the relationship between domestic players and the foreign firms on whom the former were dependent for technology and foreign finance. the second was to provide some basis for technological learning, since domestic managers and technologists would in joint venture enterprises play a role in transferring technology, adapting it if necessary and operating it under local conditions. subsequently, this requirement of partnership was strengthened by making it necessary under the foreign exchange regulation act for foreign firms to hold only 40 per cent or less of equity in most industries, if the foreign invested firm had to be eligible for national treatment. this was aimed at eroding foreign influence over their local joint ventures., in practice, of course, most foreign firms used their control over technology to sabotage this effort. since the use of patented technology by the domestic joint venture had to be licensed, foreign firms wrote into technology transfer agreements clauses that limited the ability of domestic partners to unbundle and adapt the technology, let alone seek to improve upon it through investment in research and development (r&d)., the net result was that though there was some development of indigenous technological capability, that process was slow because of restrictions on the nature of technology use. moreover, domestic firms needing the implicit or explicit link with known foreign brands as tools in the competitive battle with rivals were unwilling to break away from their foreign partners and use the knowledge they had acquired to strike out on their own. hence, every time technology was upgraded and/or modernised as part of the competitive effort, a new technology agreement had to be signed with the foreign partner, which was at all times far ahead of the domestic subsidiary in technological terms., the foreign partner, on the other hand, benefited from the domestic partnership, inasmuch as it allowed it to use the skills of major indian firms when it came to dealing with an interventionist government and local labour, for example, and especially when it came to accessing the domestic market for credit. large firms were built with small infusion of foreign capital, allowing significant repatriation of profits and royalties on the basis of a limited amount of investment and substantial borrowing., matters changed after liberalisation, which substantially diluted regulations with regard to foreign equity caps and technology transfer, and relaxed the prerequisites for national treatment. now, foreign firms are permitted to claim and repatriate a larger share of domestic profits based on a larger share in equity ownership. they can also ensure complete protection of frontline technology through direct control, rather than through patents and licensing agreements. with foreign equity caps relaxed and flexibility increased, foreign firms increasingly wanted to opt out of the collaborations they had entered into earlier. there were clearly two routes. one was to buy out indian shareholders or partners. the other, when this was not possible, was to set up a wholly new venture to which technology of more recent date and/or relating to new products was transferred., given the obstacles that were set to technological learning by domestic partners and their resulting dependence on the foreign partner for technologies of more recent date, the former were in no position to compete on equal terms with their erstwhile collaborators. the pressure on them to sell-out was high. where there were attempts to resist, as in the case of dabur and hero, for example, the foreign collaborator attempted to set up a wholly new venture., it was in circumstances like this that the “prior approval” clause served a purpose. it allowed the government to rule in favour of domestic partners who had served their collaborators well, but who on account of path dependence were not in a position to compete with them. it was a way of continuing with the protection afforded to weaker domestic players, without discriminating against the foreign partner., by doing away with the approval clause the government is overturning this whole edifice and paving the way for two potential developments. the first is one where domestic industrialists choose to sell out convinced that it would be too difficult for them to face the competition. the second is one where they refuse to sell, and foreign partners, with their newly granted freedoms, choose to set up their own sole control subsidiaries or majority ventures with pliant partners to outcompete their erstwhile collaborator. both of these trends would alter the industrial landscape with a far greater presence of foreign firms than earlier, and a smaller presence of india industrialists in high technology areas. it would also mean that technological capabilities acquired in the past are now rendered useless and little technological capacity acquisition would take place in the future. india would merely be the location for transnational production seeking to cater to its large domestic markets and a supplier of skilled labour to enhance the control over technology of transnational firms., the argument being given for this shift with its adverse implications for industrial self-reliance and indigenous technological capability generation is that india needs to stall the decline in foreign direct inflows into the country. such flows are privileged over portfolio flows since fdi flows are seen as reflecting a long-term interest of the foreign investor in domestic productive activity.",0.02793823211102623,fdi policy : opening

september last year., in its flagship annual economic publication ‘asian development outlook 2011' (ado 2011) released here, the adb has estimated india's gross domestic product (gdp) to expand by 8.2 per cent in 2011-12, down from an estimated growth rate of 8.6 per cent for the previous fiscal. for 2012-13, the multilateral lending agency projected a bounce-back in growth to 8.8 per cent with a pick-up in investment and overall economic activity and as planned reforms move forward., briefing the media at the india launch of ado 2011, adb principal economist (india) rana hasan said: “rising oil prices will bring down the growth rate to 8.2 per cent in the year ending march 2012. also, aggregate demand will tend to get squeezed on the rbi's tight monetary policy stance.”, the report noted that while improved agricultural output, strong private consumption, robust investment, and a pick-up in exports supported growth in 2010-11, continued inflationary pressure, a pull-back in private investment and structural obstacles present challenges going forward., fiscal and monetary policies will also remain less accommodating than in the past as the government follows its fiscal consolidation roadmap and the rbi acts to anchor inflation expectations, the adb pointed out that concerns over high food prices will now shift focus to oil and with soaring international oil prices putting pressure on inflation, the impact of rising prices will be on manufacturing items which will prompt the rbi to continue with its tight monetary policy stance., it expects inflation to be around 7.8 per cent in the current fiscal and at about 6.5 per cent in 2012-13., “food inflation concerns will now shift to oil. the average crude oil price is likely to remain at $104 a barrel in the current fiscal and rise to $112 a barrel in fiscal 2012-13 …we expect another 50-basis point hike by the rbi in repo and reverse repo rates in the current fiscal,” mr. hasan said., as for india's current account deficit (cad) — representing net flow of income out of the country barring capital movements — the adb expects it to be around 3.5 per cent this fiscal, higher than the 3 per cent pegged for the year ended march 31, 2010. the cad has been sustained by capital inflows, but heavy reliance on portfolio capital, relative to fdi, raises vulnerability, it said., according to adb

2011-05-17,‘rupee could depreciate by 20 per cent in two years’,"the indian rupee may depreciate by around 20 per cent during next two years on account of dip in confidence about the domestic economy leading to outflow of funds., according to a report by financial and business research firm evalueserve, there will be pressure on the rupee unless steps are taken to fix certain structural issues like high current account deficit and dwindling investments., “during the next two years the probability of the inr (indian rupee) to depreciate is the highest (about 50 per cent) as compared to an appreciation or a status quo scenario,” evalueserve said, adding that the depreciation could be in the range of around 20 per cent., during the past 12 months, the rupee has traded in a relatively narrow range between 47.33 and 43.99 to the u.s. dollar., “however, the pressure on its stability seems to become more evident,” it said., evalueserve said rupee’s depreciation could be fuelled by exit of fii money and lack of investor confidence on account of governance issues, besides high current account deficit (which is the net flow of income out of the country, barring capital movements)., “even a relatively orderly outflow of $15 billion of fii money over a year could result in the inr depreciating by 22-30 per cent. this could imply an exchange rate in the range of rs. 55-60 to every u.s. dollar,” it said., the situation could be even worse in case the outflow is faster., foreign funds have pulled out nearly rs. 3,400 crore from the indian stock market during the first half of may as interest rate pressures continue to mount., “this risk (outflow) is also heightened by the fact that india’s capital markets are very shallow and do not have the capacity to absorb even moderate external shocks,” it said., evalueserve pointed to structural factors like the high inflation, which has been blamed on supply side challenges, problems of governance as shown by recent scams, and high deficits., “inflation is at an all-time high... the monetary policy changes undertaken by the government to control inflation have been ineffective,” the report said, attributing inflation to supply side challenges including lack of infrastructure., it said that india is the only bric economy where foreign direct investment (fdi) has shown a fall. fdi fell to $19.4 billion in 2010-11 from $25.8 billion in 2009-10., “this is troubling as fdi is an important indicator of investors’ faith in a country’s long-term prospects. foreign institutional investment has been buoyant, but these funds are volatile by nature and are prone to ‘flight risk’ at the first signs of trouble, something that happened during the financial crisis,” evalueserve said., it also blamed the recent scams — as highlighted by the 2g spectrum and cwg case — for creating a perception of governance deficit in india., “this, combined with regulatory and tax uncertainty, will deter many foreign investors,” the report said., while the government has not been able to liberalise sectors like insurance for foreign players, the goods and services tax had to be postponed due to lack of consensus among political parties., evalueserve also said the ongoing political crisis in part of middle east and north africa can seriously hurt remittances. the mena region contributes to a substantial chunk of $55 billion remittance received annually from indians residing abroad., regarding deficits, it said: “the government finances are in a bad shape and the combined central and state government deficit has stubbornly stayed around 10 per cent of gdp.”, the rbi had earlier this month said it expects india’s current account deficit to be around 2.5 per cent of gdp in 2010-11., the report said that while such a rate is normal for growing economies, in india’s case it bodes ill due to lack of government savings.",-0.004519400352733682,‘rupee could depreciate 20 per cent two years

2011-05-28,kaushik basu pitches for fdi in multi-brand retail,"the inter-ministerial group (img) on inflation headed by chief economic advisor kaushik basu on friday pitched for opening up multi-brand retail to foreign direct investment (fdi) along with changes in agriculture marketing laws to help contain the inflationary pressures on the economy., addressing a press conference here, dr. basu said that based on its deliberations pertaining to food article inflation and macro-economic demand management, the img's recommendation is that the government should consider reforms in the apmc (agricultural produce markets committee) act and in the multi-product retail sector as the two important steps to cut down the margin between farm gate and retail prices., “we are taking a clear position on fdi in multi-brand retail. of course, it is a recommendation, not policy …there is a need to revise the ampc agricultural produce marketing committee act to reduce the price gap between farm gate and consumer prices. we need a model act to be adopted by states.”, increase in food prices, concerned over the runaway increase in food prices, prime minister manmohan singh had directed the setting up of the img in january this year with a mandate to look at the whole range of inflation policy issues, from distribution of foodgrains and vegetables to macro policies connected to fiscal and monetary matters and suggest ways and means of containing the price spiral., arguing its case for the two reforms, the img pointed out that correcting the margin between the price that farmers get and the price that consumers pay is not going to solve the problem of inflation for all times to come, but it can have a sharp desirable effect in the short run of bringing inflation down in food and increase the efficiency of our food markets. this, it said, can be of great value to both the farmers as well as consumers., towards this end, the img said that the apmc act ought to be amended so as to enable farmers to bring their products to retail outlets and also allow retailers to directly purchase from the farmers, without facing blockades by incumbent traders. “the apmc system has abetted monopolistic behaviour and reduced the choices available to small farmers. unwittingly, the well intentioned apmc law has contributed to helping cartelisation and collusion amongst incumbent traders. the need, therefore, is to re- visit the apmc act with this in mind,” it said., the high-powered group has recommended that since there is a model apmc act from 2003 which has not yet been implemented, the government should review and revise the model act — keeping in mind the need to keep inflationary pressures down — which could be adopted by the states to remove supply bottlenecks at the local level.",0.08333333333333333,kaushik basu pitches fdi multi-brand retail,"inter-ministerial group ( img ) inflation headed chief economic advisor kaushik basu friday pitched opening multi-brand retail foreign direct investment ( fdi ) along changes agriculture marketing laws help contain inflationary pressures economy. , addressing press conference , dr. basu said based deliberations pertaining food article inflation macro-economic demand management , img ' recommendation government consider reforms apmc ( agricultural produce markets committee ) act multi-product retail sector two important steps cut margin farm gate retail prices. , “we taking clear position fdi multi-brand retail. course , recommendation , policy … need revise ampc agricultural produce marketing committee act reduce price gap farm gate consumer prices. need model act adopted states. ” , increase food prices , concerned runaway increase food prices , prime minister manmohan singh directed setting img january year mandate look whole range inflation policy issues , distribution foodgrains vegetables macro policies connected fiscal monetary matters suggest ways means containing price spiral. , arguing case two reforms , img pointed correcting margin price farmers get price consumers pay going solve problem inflation times come , sharp desirable effect short run bringing inflation food increase efficiency food markets. , said , great value farmers well consumers. , towards end , img said apmc act ought amended enable farmers bring products retail outlets also allow retailers directly purchase farmers , without facing blockades incumbent traders. “the apmc system abetted monopolistic behaviour reduced choices available small farmers. unwittingly , well intentioned apmc law contributed helping cartelisation collusion amongst incumbent traders. need , therefore , re- visit apmc act mind , ” said. , high-powered group recommended since model apmc act 2003 yet implemented , government review revise model act — keeping mind need keep inflationary pressures — could adopted states remove supply bottlenecks local level .","{'bjp': 0, 'cong': 0}",0,0

allowing foreign direct investment (fdi) in retail sector and deemed such a move as an economic threat to the country. although prominent in western countries, this move had many problems that were being glossed over by indian policy makers many of whom were unaware of ground realties., he was addressing a meeting organised here on saturday by tamil nadu foodgrains merchants association, madurai district tiny and small scale industries association (maditssia) and swadeshi jagran manch (sjm) to oppose any move to allow foreign direct investment (fdi) in retail sector. the meeting was the next step of a seven-district yatra undertaken by sjm to create awareness among the public on this issue, which concluded on friday at virudhunagar., recalling a comment made by an advisor to the union finance ministry on the benefits of allowing fdi in retail sector, he said that these comments only betrayed the advisor's lack of knowledge about rural india and farmers. the view held by supporters of fdi that it would reduce prices, bring down inflation and help farmers get better remuneration would not materialise., while the average landholding of a canadian farmers was 650 acres and an american farmer was 450 acres, it was only 5 acre or less for an indian farmer. this was the main reason the western system would not work in india., further, he said, india was an economy with high savings rate. the entry of foreign companies in retail sector would lead to a situation where india would also become a country with a high spending rate. such a system had proved disastrous in foreign countries., quoting the example of the u.s., he said that its 20 crore population had a total of 120 crore credit cards with the families alone having a debt of $ 120 lakh crore. this had led to the u.s. becoming the highest indebted nation in the world., all effort must be taken to ensure this does not happen in india, said mr. gurumurthy, speaking earlier, maditssia president n. somasundaram said that of the 110 crore people in the country, only around 15 to 20 per cent were employed with the most of the rest being self-employed. most of this self-employment was generated in retail sector, upon which 20 crore people were dependent directly or indirectly. any move to open up the sector would jeopardise their livelihood, he said., tn foodgrains merchants association

2011-06-02,telecom scandal,"the editorial “the habit of covering up” (june 2) has raised pertinent questions regarding the involvement of ministers and bigwigs other than a. raja in the 2g spectrum scandal before 2007-08, and the whereabouts of the rest of the money. the declared maxims of sonia gandhi and the proclaimed principles of prime minister manmohan singh are evidently not being practised. dr. singh should ask textiles minister dayanidhi maran to resign. the questions on his alleged acts favouring his family-run sun direct tv pvt. ltd. need to be examined seriously., b. rajasekaran, bangalore, the reports that the former telecom minister's policies benefited the company of sun tv network owned by his brother kalanidhi maran has brought to light yet another case of alleged misuse of power by the dmk ministers. the sequence of events — from the change of fdi norms in the telecom sector, the maxis group acquiring a 74 per cent stake in aircel, the telecom ministry granting 14 2-g unified access services licences to aircel and the maxis group's subsequent investment in sun direct tv pvt. limited — points to a very clear route map of misuse of power. the nation is already shocked by the mega spectrum scam, in which too dmk members have been charge sheeted. with the latest disclosures, the credibility of the upa government, particularly the dmk functionaries, has been eroded., muralidharan raju iyer, chennai, the editorial is incisive, thought-provoking and timely. if the upa government refuses to see the writing on the wall even now, it will have only itself to blame for the inevitable catastrophe., v. balasubramanian, coimbatore, for the dmk, already beleaguered by the arrest of rajya sabha mp kanimozhi in connection with the 2g spectrum issue and the defeat in the recent tamil nadu assembly elections, the maran episode has brought more trouble. the revelations about the textile minister's alleged moves favouring his family during his tenure as telecom minister have given the opposition yet another chance to put the upa government in a spot. it will be interesting to see how the congress, which promised to take corruption head on, responds., pratham dwivedi, new delhi, dr singh, in spite of his proven uprightness, honesty and integrity, has become a soft target. he is like the captain of a ship caught in a vicious storm. he can resign. but imagine the chaos that will follow. dr. singh should tell himself ‘thus far and no more.' he should expose the corrupt so that the nation is rid of the bad elements., j.v. reddy, nellore, the habit of covering up under the stewardship of dr. singh has come to such a pass that he is forced to send an entourage of his cabinet to a baba to persuade him not to go on a fast. the cartoon (june 2) says it all so poignantly., kasim sait, chennai, there seems no end to the predilections of upa-ii. more skeletons tumble out of its cupboard with each passing day. the mere detention of a few politicians and business tycoons is not enough, as there is something more to the 2g scam than meets the eye., h.p. murali, bangalore, i fully agree with the views expressed in the editorial. mr maran needs to do a lot of explaining. his mere denial in terse phrases cannot sell as similar and, perhaps, more vociferous denials issued by another central minister have been laid bare now., on a wider note, what is worrying is the magnitude of the scams that keep surfacing day after day. the prime minister can no longer remain silent. the nation expects him to act., r. kalyanaraman, chennai, dr. singh should take the sensitive issue seriously and sort it out. following anna hazare's style, baba ramdev has shocked the congress by his decision to go on an indefinite fast. the atmosphere is surcharged with the spirit of upsurge against corruption, symbolised by the ruling upa government. dr. singh should advise mr. maran to step down immediately., s. venugopalan, chennai, the 2g spectrum scam seems to be too malignant a tumour. the amount so far said to have been unearthed is microscopic compared to the astronomical dimension of the scam. as the editorial rightly says, people have a right to know “where has the rest of the money gone.” the government requires a very strong political will to bring out the complete truth. but can the upa ii government, with its commitment to ‘coalition dharma,' act?, t. raghavan, chennai, the only fig leaf which the upa is using to cover up the various acts of omission and commission in its government is dr. singh's credibility. but the fact that the 2g scam took place right under his nose proves that he was not in control. his personal integrity would have been commendable only if he had demanded similar conduct from his ministers. a leader should be judged by the conduct of his followers., srinivas chandrashekaran, bangalore",-0.0011954365079365054,telecom scandal,"editorial “the habit covering ” ( june 2 ) raised pertinent

2011-06-28,reading fdi trends,"a constant refrain in recent times is that india is losing out in the battle to attract foreign direct investment into the country. even the financial times has more than once argued that india is experiencing a deceleration in fdi inflows as a result of a combination of factors varying from procedural bottlenecks in areas like mining, policy blockages or sheer fatigue with corruption (see issues dated june 1 and june 17 2011). to stall and reverse this decline, such observers argue, it is necessary to relax foreign investment policies further (as in multi-brand retail), raise ceiling on foreign participation, and be less stringent when it comes to implementing environmental and land acquisition norms. some policy makers agree with them. india needs foreign funds to sustain high investment, but the flow of such funds is being constricted by stalled “reform” and arbitrary regulation, is the refrain., the evidence to back this view is weak, to say the least. if we consider annual flows of foreign investment, what we find is that fdi flows registered a dramatic increase in 2007-08, from $23 billion to $35 billion, hovered around $38 billion during 2008-10 and then fell to a lower but still respectable $27 billion in 2010-11. the problem has not been the level of fdi flows but a degree of volatility. during these years, what are identified as portfolio flows have been even more volatile, fluctuating between a net inflow of $32 billion during the last two years (2009-11) and a negative $14 billion in the crisis year 2008-09., even if we examine quarterly figures, we find that fdi flows that rose from $6.9 billion in the second quarter of 2009 to a peak of $8.2 billion in the third quarter of that year, have since stayed in the 5-6 billion range for all but one quarter, namely january-march 2011. in fact, if we consider the 16 quarters ending jan-march 2011, there have been only two in which fdi inflows stood at between $6-7 billion and four when it exceeded 7 billion. thus, what the numbers point to is a degree of volatility around a $5-6 billion per quarter range, that cautions against reading too much into figures from any single quarter. in fact, no sooner had the financial times declared that foreign direct investment into india had “tumbled 32 per cent to just $3.4 billion” during january to march 2011 that it emerged that net fdi flows in the month of april alone amounted to $3.1 billion., in sum, there is little evidence pointing to any major reversal in the trend of foreign direct investment flows into india in recent quarters or years. what is true is that while the combined figure for net foreign direct and portfolio investment flows into india has remained large through the recent period excepting for 2008-09, foreign direct investment has like portfolio investment begun to display a degree of volatility, even if not to the same degree. this leads to confusion since conventionally portfolio investment flows were seen as components of “hot money” flows that were volatile, whereas direct investment flows were seen as being more stable and less footloose., there are two factors that could explain this tendency towards fdi volatility. the first is that the distinction between direct and portfolio investment may be blurring. this should not come as a surprise since though conceptually direct investment is treated as capital invested by entities with a more lasting, long-term interest in the host economy, the statistical (oecd) definition of a direct investment is any investment in equity by a single foreign shareholder that equals or exceed 10 per cent of the equity in a firm. thus there could be a large number of investors with no lasting interest who get classified as direct investors because they buy into more than 10 per cent of equity, when they are essentially looking for returns in the short to medium term in the form of capital gains. with hedge funds and private equity firms looking to buy equity shares in the indian financial space, the nature of the bets and the size of the investment would be substantially different. if for example, equity is being bought in a firm with the expectation that its value would appreciate since it is a likely target for a take over bid, the equity share held to attract bids from acquirers is bound to be higher. in india, the problem is compounded further because of the inclusion of foreign currency convertible preference shares and bonds in the definition of “equity”, even though there are or are more like debt instruments (refer smitha francis, economic and political weekly, may 29, 2010).",0.037483423749246535,reading fdi trends,"constant refrain recent times india losing battle attract

2011-08-21,external economy — always challenging,"containers are being loaded at the mundra port and special economic zone(mpsezl), 400 km from ahmedabad. | photo credit: sam panthaky , the current preoccupation of policy makers on controlling inflation is entirely justified but should not obscure the fact that certain other sectors too require attention., take the external sector for instance. management of the external economy has been a bright spot in the overall macroeconomic scenario at least since the beginning of economic reform (early 1990s)., liberalisation and the consequent opening up of the domestic economy necessitated a higher order of economic management. after the severe balance of payments crisis in 1991, there was a paradigm shift in the management of the external economy., the sweeping changes introduced then covering foreign trade, foreign investment, exchange rate and reserves have served the country well., particularly noteworthy is the fact that deft external sector management enabled the country to get past major economic and financial crises relatively unscathed. after the recent financial sector-led-global economic crisis, india's prudential policies covering banks and external sector issues such as capital account convertibility have won high praise and commended for emulation by other countries., the calibrated approach to capital account convertibility and controls over capital flows were criticised as being too conservative., today it has become mainstream. even institutions such as the imf advocate capital controls under certain special circumstances., a focus on the external economy is also warranted because it can give valuable clues to the burning issue of the day, namely, inflation., besides, as a general rule it is naive to think that any economic issue however serious and politically sensitive — which inflation certainly is — can be examined and countered in isolation. for example, high global commodity prices, including those of petroleum are driving up inflation., all economic forecasters, rbi included, have based their guidance on growth and inflation after taking into account the trends in global commodity prices., export performance, the recent export performance has been exemplary. there has been a slowdown in the global economy and indian exporters who have traditionally depended on the large markets of the eu, the u.s. and japan have had a challenging task., europe's debt problems for long simmering have come to a boil. both u.s. and japan have been witnessing lower than expected growth rates., in the circumstances, the foreign trade policy (2009-14) with its emphasis on diversification both in terms of commodities and export markets has proved to be far sighted., trade with africa, latin america and a few other non-traditional areas has been on the rise thanks to supportive government policies and has, to a considerable extent, helped exporters in facing the consequences of the global slowdown., exports grew by 38 per cent to touch $250.5 billion in 2010-11., with the momentum continuing into this year, exports are slated to clock a growth rate of 32 per cent to $330.2 billion in 2011-12. imports too have been robust. despite strong export growth, the trade deficit has increased to $130.5 billion in 2010-11 from $118.4 billion in the year before., more significantly, the impressive export performance and consequently the lower merchandise trade deficit have helped in containing the current account deficit to what is considered to be a prudential limit of less than 3 per cent of the gdp during 2010-11., in india, invisible receipts have played a major role in reducing the size of the current account deficit., in what could be the beginning of a downward trend, invisible receipts have come down from $89.9 billion in 2008-09 to nearly $80 billion in 2009-10 but has increased to $86.2 billion in 2010-11., of even greater concern are some disquieting features in capital flows., the non-debt creating foreign direct investment (fdi) has come down sharply from $33.1 billion to $23.4 billion between 2009-10 and 2010-11 portfolio flows decreased marginally from $32.4 billion to $30.3 billion., on the other hand, debt creating flows represented by external commercial borrowings (ecbs) and foreign currency convertible bonds (fccbs) went up from $18.36 billion in 2008-09 to $21.67 billion in 2009-10., there are bound to be differences between the data furnished by the government and that furnished by the rbi. but the broad trends will be the same., outlook for 2011-12, the prime minister's economic advisory council (pmeac) in its economic outlook (july 2011) projects that merchandise exports at $330 billion (bop basis) will grow by 32 per cent in 2011-12, while imports at $484 billion would expand by 27 per cent leaving a merchandise trade deficit of $154 billion or 7.7 per cent of the projected gdp., service sector earnings and remittance inflows (ites exports and private remittances) are projected to grow by 18 per cent in the first-half of 2011-12 and by 11 per cent during the second-half (14 per cent for the whole year)., net investment outgo will be higher by 15 per cent. the current account deficit is projected at around 2.7 per cent., the outlook for capital account is clouded with a great deal of

2011-09-12,a bill that facilitates displacement?,"farmers from haryana during a demonstration against land acquisition, in new delhi. file photo: ramesh sharma , the foreword — to the draft national land acquisition and rehabilitation and resettlement bill 2011 — that says “urbanisation is inevitable” (i.p.1) signifies danger. the bill, if enacted in its present form, is likely to worsen, and not stop, displacement of tribal, dalit and other backward communities. the bill states: “the issue of who acquires land is less important than the process of land acquisition, compensation for land acquired and r&r process, package and conditions … the objective is to make the process of land acquisition easy, transparent, and fair for both sides in each instance …”(p.1, emphasis added). but who acquires land is intrinsically connected to why it is acquired in the first place., land alienation, ownership and contradictions arising from it concern world political economy and external agencies that have been dictating conditions to the indian government at the centre and state level on policy matters in land reforms. some of these terms and conditions reflect in the larr bill 2011 if one reads between the lines. a policy document of the world bank, for instance (“india: land policies for growth and poverty reduction,” report no. 38298-in, july 9, 2007, agriculture and rural development sector unit, india country management unit, south asia region) made a few recommendations for policy reform, which included, “eliminate restrictions on land markets.” under this — “it will be desirable to (i) make leasing legal where it is currently prohibited…(ii) allow transferability of land by land reform beneficiaries at least through lease and explore options for making the gains from such reform permanent; (iii) drop restrictions on sale of land to non-agriculturists and subdivision which have little economic justification; and (iv) review legislation on compulsory land acquisition and, subject to the prevention of undesirable externalities, allow farmers or their representatives to negotiate with and if desired transfer land directly to investors rather than having to go through government and often receive only very limited compensation.”, it is a matter of serious concern that this bill looks at r&r and land acquisition as “two sides of the same coin” and this is partly a result of the pressure built over the years by movements against big dams. this bill facilitates acquiring land, including commons, presently in the hands of small and marginal farmers from tribal, sc and backward communities under the pretext of an unstated ‘public purpose' for “infrastructure development” which may well accompany future fdi in food and agriculture, and several related developments linking the global market to india. in urban areas it is very clear that it is connected to real estate development in return for crumbs such as ‘housing for the urban poor' schemes., the government is fast-tracking into a future which facilitates transfer of land into the hands of the urban elite. even if there is a caveat placed on r&r in case of acquisition up to 100 acres, there is no mechanism to stop the rich from taking an easy way out, opting for say 90 acres. does that not call for r&r?, while one good point in the bill is that “under no circumstances” multicropped, irrigated land (sic) be acquired, what if a multicropped land or two came within the 100 acres identified for the larger acquisition? the definition of “multi-crop” is unclear. is it a number of crops grown in a single season or in alternate seasons by rotation?, as for the sia (social impact assessment), there is mention of “two non-official social scientists, two experts in the area relating to the project.” women, senior citizens and children are not part of this exercise. the affected people are not to select this group. what is the guarantee that the group will not favour those who wish to acquire land? most ‘experts' come from sections not directly displaced/dispossessed. we are unwilling to have a forum with the poor as their own representatives on decisions affecting them., the understanding of “minimum” displacement, “minimum disturbance to infrastructure, ecology and minimum adverse impact on individuals affected” is highly subjective and left open-ended without defining the “minimum” displacement (in forests, for instance; or damage to rivers, for instance — how much is ‘minimum”?), as for the public hearing on the notification issued for acquisition, why not have a pre-notification, prior, on “intent” to acquire land, instead, where a gram sabha, or committees in urban slums, for instance, can take a collective decision for or against acquisition?, what are the implications of this bill for the polavaram dam? it has a lot that will actually make the dam (if the bill becomes an act) illegal and invalid on most points mentioned therein on land acquisition. but a deeper reading of the bill makes it clear that much of it will actually not help stall the dam works in any major way. the onus will be on people to enter into litigation to reclaim their land from the government if the bill is passed. the provision of “one acre of land to each family in the command area if land is acquired for irrigation project” seems foolhardy if it plans to cover entire populations displaced by irrigation projects (in polavaram alone, the figure is nearly three lakh people). where is this kind of land available in the proposed command area?, the first point on which the polavaram-dislocated (who lost land, not necessarily physically displaced) can be one up on the government is within the clause “safeguards against indiscriminate acquisition.” this says — “land to be returned to original owner if not used in 5 years for the purpose for which it is acquired.” it was in 2005 that most of the land acquisition for the polavaram dam started and the only ‘work' done is the digging of canals. so, will the government of andhra pradesh face legal action if this bill becomes an act?, so far as tribal communities are concerned, a point in their favour under “minimum r&r entitlements special provisions for st's” makes space for “preference in relocation and resettlement in area in same compact block.” in the case of the polavaram dam, no care was taken to do so, in any of the three r&r colonies (of which only two are under construction). and here we are talking of 300 villages to be submerged, and where are those 300 tribal villages to be resettled in ‘compact' colonies?

2011-09-24,issue of fdi in retail far from settled,"the government has initiated steps for allowing foreign direct investment (fdi) in multi-brand retail but the issue is far from settled even among the various arms of retail businesses such as traders, retailers and business houses. this was amply evident during a discussion on ‘fdi in retail: understanding the issues' in the opening session of the india retail forum organised by images india here., two-day event, the two-day event projected as the ‘ultimate retail knowledge platform' saw participation from industry bigwigs, including abheek singhi (boston consulting group), rajeev kumar (ficci), kishore biyani (future group), raj jain (walmart india), bijou kurien (reliance retail lifestyle), ajit joshi (infinity retail), thomas varghese (aditya birla retail), nikhil chaturvedi (provogue), b. c. bhartia (confederation of all india traders) and viren shah (federation of retail traders welfare association)., while the traders' representatives questioned the need for the “marketing” of fdi in multi-brand retail and the resultant imminent loss of jobs, the retailers emphasised the need for capital, technology and knowhow. “foreign companies do not want to come for some altruistic reasons. they are looking for business and for expanding their footprint,” said mr bhartia., however, when asked pointedly by mr. biyani of big bazaar if he had known of any kirana stores that had closed down as a result of the growth of retailers, mr. bhartia could not immediately come up with any examples but he added that the government's call for private investments in warehouses and in storages had not met with any success “because there was no money there''., he went on to assert that the only ones interested in bringing fdi in multi-brand retail were “some bureaucrats in the prime minister's office and the multinational companies themselves''., game changer, as always, the voice of the farmers and consumers was missing from the discussion until mr. varghese became the game changer by emphasising that the need to start with fdi and technological inputs from the back-end supply chain. mr. shah also stressed the need for fdi in back-end supply., mr. biyani, who is planning a big entry into the processed food sector, said that modern retail drove consumption of processed foods which promoted economic activity. impetus to this sector will come from fdi because foreign investors look at long-term perspectives unlike domestic players who do not look beyond five years. mr. chaturvedi, however, wanted a headstart for domestic retailers before the government gave a green signal to foreign investors. even mr. joshi, who opposed fdi in retail to some extent, demanded a level-playing field for indian players., both mr. shah and mr. bhartia, speaking for small retailers and kirana stores, expressed apprehension that their interests would be compromised. when someone suggested a model in which foreign investors could give franchise to domestic players in back-end supply chain, mr. bhartia said even that was “not acceptable'' as that was a “backdoor entry route” and in no time there would be take-overs and the domestic owners would work as “managers'' in those stores only to be “kicked out eventually”., reaction, this argument invoked a strong reaction from mr. kumar of ficci who emphasised that one should look at “the glass as half full instead of half empty'' when india was looking to become a global player and was looking at a gdp growth rate of between 8 per cent and 9 per cent., defending fdi in retail sector, mr. raj jain of walmart-india pointed out that “it was now known that the structural food inflation was likely to be here in india for about the next seven years because people were living better and eating better. you need to produce more or import more and there are limitations to both. you need investment and technological inputs to link the back-end supply chain with the front-end”., the discussion concluded with a haze over the policy the government was set to adopt. several participants were sceptical about the conditionality of giving protection to 30 per cent small traders, 15 per cent investment in back-end supply along with the state governments having a say in the matter., “the government may allow fdi in retail in four months

2011-09-28,transcript of prime minister’s comments on board special aircraft,"q : on slowing down of world economy, concerns among g 20 countries about state of global economy and what could india do about it?, ans- well let me say, the world economy is an increasingly inter- dependent entity. fuel of trade and technology and capital inflows influence the growth path of a large number of countries today. and if those economies which are the locomotives economies of the world, the united states, europe, japan are in trouble there is bound to be some effect on us. but we have so far managed to protect our economy in a manner that has earned us the admiration of the world. in the year 2008, when the global economy bought into problems, our economy still managed to grow @ 6.7 percent. later on we were able to raise the rate of growth to 8.1/2 percent and even in this troubled year the projection of indian growth rate would still be between 7.8 to 8.5% and that would be a remarkable performance. let me say that we can do more in india, if all political parties of our country work together, if government is allowed to do its essential task, which is maintain a growth path of about 9 percent, which is possible for us to do so. despite what is happening in the world, if only we could step up investment in infrastructure in our economy, we would be on a strong wicket, and that’s what i would like government to do., q: on political challenges in the near future, agenda to handle political situation in country and to get more support including from opposition parties., ans- well, we would like to appeal to all political parties who have the good of the country in their heart to work together. politics will continue to divide, but there are limits to which we can carry these political dissensions and i do believe the time has come, when all political parties should forget their differences, concentrate on essential pieces of legislations, like the passage of a bill to raise the foreign investment in the insurance sector. we need to pass a bill with regard to pension rights, we need to pass a bill with regard to goods and service tax, we need to pass a bill with regard to lokpal, we need to pass a bill in public procure policies reforms. there are a number of bills, well structured bills in the field of education held up in parliament. if we concentrate on all these things, i am quite sure the indian economy has the capacity to weather the storm and come out of it successfully., q. on global economic crisis and what can india do to insulate itself?, ans- well, i think let me say we are not that helpless, though i would not say that we will not be affected by what happens in the outside world. we have savings rates of about 34 or 35 percent. our investment rate in recent years has been about 37 percent of the gdp. with saving rates of even of 35 percent, we can maintain a growth rate of close to 8.5 to 9 percent. now if we spend this savings well, if our infrastructure is well managed, if social sector programmes leakages can be curbed, i think that’s the path which would keep india afloat and afloat handsomely even the world is in dire trouble., q: on media reports of hm’s offer to resign and perception of rifts in government., ans- i think this rifts that you talk about, i find reflected only in the media. i am not aware of such any rift. we are a cohesive government. we shall remain a cohesive government. so let there be no confusion on that score. there is no dissension in the cabinet. having said that, let me said that in all cabinets when we debate, we debate with an open mind on issues, ministers can have a different perspective and that is not i think, something which can contribute to the divisiveness. that's in a way healthy but there is nothing of that sort which is being written for the last few days in the media, about the differences between mr. chidambaram and mr. mukherjee., q- on letter on spectrum pricing to pm written by mr. maran leading to amendments of tor, ans.- well, that was way back in 2006. at that time licensing of what took place in 2007 or 2008 was not on the horizon. the real concern of the government at that point was that we should persuade that defence ministry to vacate spectrum and that spectrum should be made available to the civilian economy. in the process we will make lot of money and also the economy would gain efficiency. and it is certainly true that one draft that was prepared did include spectrum prices and mr. dayanidhi maran did object and he said spectrum pricing is a bread and butter and integral part of the rule of business of his department, and any case he said that a large group like gom that we are setting up, is not going to be able to deal effectively with the complicated technical aspects involved. and further more it was pointed out to me that there was a cabinet decision of 2003, which said that spectrum prices is a matter which should be discussed between the finance ministry and the telecom ministry. and in the light of all that i came to the conclusion that my agreeing with mr. maran’s point of view would not amount to sacrificing anything, which is essential and integral to the success of the process., q- on note sent by finance ministry to pmo and possible culpability of hm?, ans. – let me say that, what particular note you are talking about i read about that. this note is designed to set out a record of what took place. all these matters now are in the public domain. they are being looked into by the courts and therefore, it would not be appropriate for me to comment one way or the other what is good and what is bad in these notes. they are the properties of the public. they are now being discussed in the courts. as far as mr. chidambaram is concerned i have said it while i was on my way to new york that he continues to enjoy my full confidence, when he was finance minister and now as home minister and that applies to him and that applies to finance minister, q: on change in thinking about benefits of globalization?, a: when the world changes we have to take note of those changes. we cannot be static in a world that is fast moving and there is no doubt that there are immense changes that are taking place. globalization has a lot of potential to do good, but if globalization is not properly managed and if misused by big powers, it can also hurt the poorer countries in the world., q: on reports and concerns about diversion of brahmaputra waters by china?, ans : well we have been discussing the issues relating to the trans border river system with china, for number of years. i have myself raised this issue with both the president as well as the prime minister of china on number of occasions. they have assured us that they are not doing anything which will be detrimental to the interests of india. and so far the evidence we have supports their statement that nothing is happening on the ground which we should be worried about., q – on why opposition parties which were amenable earlier are playing hard ball now?, ans – well i think, the opposition is getting prematurely restless. i think i have said this in the parliament that we have a mandate from the people of india to govern and to govern well. and that the opposition should wait for two and half years. the opposition feels that they have got hold of some weak points of our government and therefore by focusing attention on that they can force an early election. it is not going to happen. this govt. has a mandate for five years which will stay its course. and we will do things, when you look back, might well surprise the country., q- on approval rating of upa ii and its performance in comparison with upa-i ?, ans.- i think in upa-i we were new comers, we were innovators, now we have i think, programme of implementing some of the important flagship programmes, which we placed before our country and which won the approval of the people of india. now as far as the approval rating of the upa-ii is concerned, i should be asking you. because the issue on which the government is now being judged, whether it is 2g or some thing else, it happened way before the last election, since then, we have had an election in which the congress party was successful, therefore i think i suspect, that there are other forces that work which want to destabilize our polity. this is not simply in the concern about our performance. but i would be the last man to say that. there are reasons for example, that we are not able to control inflation as effectively as possible. but if you look at china today with its successful economy the chinese food inflation rate in the month of august is as high as 13%. this is global phenomenon. we have to sail and sail successfully in these difficult times and nothing should be done to weaken the self confidence of the nation., q- on impression that growth would dip to below 7% and sense of urgency was missing?, ans: i don’t buy that argument. what ever we can do without legislation, will be done with speed and with efficiency. what requires legislation, of course requires the collaboration between the government and the opposition parties. we have made efforts in the past. we will continue and make efforts in the future. but even under the most adverse condition the growth rate of indian economy will not fall below 7.5 to 8 percent. that's my analysis. in a world where the us growth rate is 0.7% a 7 - 7.5% growth rate is a real marvel which the world still respects india for., q- on failure of government to manage public perceptions?, ans. – well it is quite possible, i think perceptions are important. perceptions can be changed. we are not very good in public communications. i keep telling our people, may be we should focus more sharply on changing the perceptions. you are right, i think., q- on perception that government faces instability due to scams., ans. i don’t see it that way. you look at what happned in 2008. te world was collapsing. the world banking system was in deep trouble and yet we managed to keep afloat. our growth rate is respectable and it will remain respectable by global standards. inflation has been a problem but that is also because all factors beyond control. if international prices go up there is no way in which we can keep domestic prices untouched, unaffected. but i also feel that we have now reached a plateau. food prices are by and large stable. what are not stable are prices of vegetables, fish products, cold drink etc. and that is the demand - supply gap which is not a failure of our policies. it is a measure of success of our policies that incomes of people are rising in a manner that they want more and more eggs, fruits and vegetables., on likelihood of major reshuffle?, ans- i am not thinking in terms of any cabinet reshuffle. if there is time, you will hear about it. but right now, i have no such idea in my mind., q- on foreign armed intervention in libya and other countries?, ans – well i was referring to the situation as it has developed in libya. my worry is that despite what the western powers are saying about libya, that they their success in getting rid of gadaffi, there are still signs that libya may well be entrapped in civil war like somalia. and if it goes in the somalian way it will be in nobody's interest., q- on india’s permanent membership of unsc, ans: i think that at unga we can count on the support of about120 members already. as far as the permanent members of unsc are concerned you heard president obama, when he came to india. you heard the russian leadership. the chinese leadership is somewhat hesitant but not totally unsupportive. so i am not predicting that it will fall into our lap tomorrow or the day after. but i think the climate of global opinion, is certainly in favour of a country like india being made a permanent member of the reformed unsc., q- on death sentence for rajiv gandhi assassins, ans :- well the law of the land will prevail, q- on fdi in retail trade?, ans : the fdi in retail is under consideration, of the government, for quite some time. but there are worries in certain circles like the trading community. it is our task to go about it in a manner, in which the nation enjoys the benefits of more fdi in retail trade, without hurting our domestic interests. i can assure that we will do nothing which will hurt the essential interests of the small indian trade community., q- on kudankulam civil nuclear project?, aans – it is my honest expectation that sooner or later the world would recognize that there is no alternative but to rely on atomic energy, as an essential component of the energy mix of a country, any country that seeks protection of its environment that wants to protect itself from excessive carbon emission. i have no reason to believe that the leadership in tamil nadu will be an exception to this rule. there are anxieties. some vested interests are playing on that. i have spoken to the hon’ble chief minister of tamil nadu myself before coming. we will sit together with all the enlightened leadership of tamil nadu to find a practical and pragmatic solution because, tamil nadu is today the fastest industrializing state in the country. i feel very proud, when i go to tamil nadu, when i see the way industry is expanding. but quite honestly, this industrialization can become a casualty if tamil nadu is not self sufficient in the field of energy. i am sure that leadership of all shades of opinion will recognize, that a healthy mix should include an element of nuclear energy for safely and for security. we will protect all the people of india. our safety standards will be second to none. and if we have any doubt we will be the first to tell our people that we will not move forward., q- on murder of prof. rabbani murder, security situation in afpak and gen. mullen’s views on complicity of isi, ans in my speech at un, i joined the rest of the world in offering my condolences to the people of afghanistan on the killing of prof. rabbani. there is now growing awareness of the groups which indulge in these nefarious activities and we have to take notice of that. and what gen. mullen has said with regard to the role of certain forces in pakistan, is also something which is nothing new to us. in fact when we were the first to flag this issue earlier, the world didn’t believe us. i am glad that at least the world recognizes the truth of what the government and the people of india had been saying about the activities of isi for many many years., onboard from frankfurt to new delhi",0.12249698118195228,transcript prime

2011-10-18,rbi & india's financial growth,"the persisting global financial crisis has generated widespread interest in the contours of monetary policy and financial regulation both in the developed countries and in the emerging market economies. this definitive analysis of india’s monetary policy and its financial sector reforms by rakesh mohan — a former deputy governor of the reserve bank of india who was a part of its policy group during a crucial period in the last decade — is a timely contribution to the debate on these issues., of the 12 essays in this collection, many are the revised and updated versions of the papers the author had presented at various conferences. the book opens with an analysis of india’s growth record over the last six decades. in the first few decades after independence, when public sector was visualised as the engine of growth, the accent of fiscal policy was on high levels of taxation to garner resources for investment in that sector. monetisation of budget deficits was another way of funding the investments. moreover, there was an air of financial repression, thanks to the administered interest rates and rigid inter-sectoral credit allocation. even in those days of limited autonomy for the rbi, monetary policy instruments like the slr and crr were used to prevent undue expansion of money supply. this, in fact, enabled india to fend off high levels of inflation, a phenomenon several developing countries, notably in latin america, had to contend with., post-liberalisation, the financial sector reforms have served to enhance not just the competitiveness and efficiency of banks, but also their stability. the rbi saw to it that the banks followed internationally acceptable prudential norms of capital adequacy. the policy of risk weighting of the banks’ assets and provisioning requirements ensured that credit was directed towards sound investments rather than speculative transactions., as a cumulative outcome of all these factors, domestic savings rose progressively to touch 38 per cent in 2008, which in turn supported higher levels of economic growth. also, indian banks could remain virtually unaffected by the global turbulence during the east asian financial crisis (1997) and the north atlantic countries’ financial meltdown (2007-08)., with the practice of automatic monetisation of the central government’s deficits getting phased out in the early 1990s, the rbi’s ability to use monetary instruments was greatly strengthened. nowadays, the central and state governments borrow money through auctioning of bonds in the market — where the rbi does not figure as a buyer — with the interest rate on their borrowings being determined by the market. further, the coming into being of the fiscal responsibility and budget management act resulted in a substantial reduction in fiscal deficit at the central and state levels. and the upshot of this is that the private sector could access more resources from the market and the interest rates dropped significantly during 2003-08. since 2009, however, inflationary pressures seem to have reversed this trend to some extent., in the management of exchange rate and foreign capital inflow, securing financial markets against volatility has been an important element. on the question of foreign exchange convertibility, the policymakers consciously adopted a gradualist approach in respect of the capital account. while risk capital was allowed to flow liberally in the form of fdi and portfolio investments, short term commercial borrowings were given only a limited scope. the impact of foreign capital volatility on portfolio investments was tempered through open market operations and ‘sterilization’ measures., rakesh mohan puts up a strong, well-constructed defence of the monetary policy pursued by the rbi over the past two decades. unlike the central banks of many other countries, which focussed exclusively on controlling inflation, the rbi, he says, calculatedly set for itself multiple objectives — price stability, exchange rate management, and financial stability coupled with adequate credit supply to sustain growth.",0.09375097580015616,rbi &amp;

2011-11-13,private equity players bet on realty sector,"real estate private equity (pe) players have become a part of growth story since their entry into india in 2006. their investment went up to $7.6 billion within a year from $1.2 billion. subsequently, however, there has been a fall in their investment, primarily attributed to the global financial crisis. in the current calendar year so far, total investment from pes was around $741 million., deals, asset-wise, large investments (commercial, mixed use, residential, sez and township) were made during 2007 and 2008. each of these two years saw 57 investment deals., during 2010, the number of deals dropped to 27 and further to seven in 2011. the investment into the indian real estate was primarily due to the futuristic view adopted by the pes and developers during the peak period. investors from the u.s. and the u.k. lined up to india to invest in the real estate sector as they felt that india was a stable country. but subsequently global economic crisis has resulted in slowdown in investments., “one cannot deny that private equity firms have really helped the indian real estate developers”, says sriram srinivasan, associate director, head, capital market (chennai), jones lang lasalle (jll). with fdi (foreign direct investment) in place, small developers, too, are now able to take up large projects. developers either enter into agreement with pes as joint venture partners or let pes take up stake in their land bank by creating a special purpose vehicle for a particular project., according to om chaudhry, chief executive officer, fire capital fund private limited, private equity firms are bound to stay in india. urban housing in india is a trillion dollar opportunity over 2011 to 2026. it, in fact, has the strength to push the gdp (gross domestic product) growth by another 2 percentage points and seek the much wanted 10 per cent rate of growth. players who can capitalise on this opportunity with continuous adherence to quality and customer focus shall command definitive success, feels mr. chaudhry., various types of assets, according to a jll report, about $15.8 billion has been invested from 2006 till date on various types of assets. of which, $2.7 billion went to residential projects and $2.4 billion to township projects. a sum of $2.3 billion went to commercial projects, $2.1 billion to mixed use and $961.4 million to sezs. during the current year, pes invested $320 million in commercial, $65 million in mixed use, $44 million in residential, $190 million in sezs and $122 million in township projects., during 2011, hyderabad attracted the highest investment of $190 million followed by chennai $143 million, ncr (national capital region) $66 million and bangalore $22 million, says a jll report., mr. chaudhry says that private equity funds, especially in real estate, are long-term funds. it will work with the investors during their commitment period. further, the way pe funds function is based on the commitments from the limited partners. in a pressing environment, the limited partners, too, feel the need to conserve cash and not take higher risk bets. returns of pe funds are based on the sector they operate in. they expect returns as per the risk of the bets that they are taking. globally, return on investment for private equity firms averages around 16 per cent. accounting for risk associated with emerging markets like india, international investors seek 20 per cent return. private equity investment in real estate in india is largely dominated by project-level investment, as the consideration set for entry level investment is too small. weak governance, financial mismanagement, lack of transparency, execution capability of developers, market

2011-11-15,next steps on the silk road - geoffrey pyatt's address to ficci,"as prepared, thank you, mr. murari, for such a warm introduction. i’d also like to thank the members of the federation of indian chambers of commerce and industry for asking me to speak today. for me, it’s a real treat to be back in chennai, a city blessed by geography, an intrepid and highly intellectual citizenry, and of course, the majestic waters of the bay of bengal. i spent my childhood along the coast of southern california, and have always appreciated the economic and cultural advantages bestowed upon beautiful coastal cities like this one., one need only take a stroll along marina beach to realize the virtues of this exceptional city and its people. throughout history, madras – and later chennai – has lured international commerce and fostered global connectivity. while the phenomenon of globalization is measured most places in years and decades, madras has enjoyed global connectivity for centuries!, bearing in mind this city’s history as a crossroads of culture and commerce, i would like to focus my remarks today on india’s economic relationships – with the united states, with its immediate neighbors and finally with the wider asia-pacific region and along what we have called the new “silk road.” so let’s start with india and the united states., the u.s-india economic moment, i don’t need to convince this audience that u.s.-india economic ties are as promising as they have ever been. economic cooperation has been the driving force behind our transformed bilateral relationship and, in many ways, is the decisive factor behind india’s achievement of greater influence and responsibility in the international system. we find ourselves in an enviable moment in time, where our perseverance and hard work on the u.s. – india relationship will improve the lives of hundreds of millions of people – if not billions – through the 21st century., bilateral trade is flourishing, with indian investment in the united states increasing substantially. the pace of innovation in india has been amazing. here in chennai, automobile components, software development, hardware manufacturing and healthcare industries are all thriving, building-out a diversified economic base reflecting the indian economy of tomorrow, directly linked to global markets and vital to u.s. and global economic prosperity., on the u.s. side, the outdated perception of an indian economy that detracts from u.s. production and output is widely seen as an anachronism. as former united states trade representative susan esserman recently noted, the periodic debate over outsourcing doesn’t “begin to capture the richness, breadth and diversity of the u.s.-india economic relationship.”, now, given that 80 percent of the infrastructure of india of 2030 has yet to be built – 80 percent! – the united states sees a great opportunity to deepen our commercial partnership. three statistics to illustrate this point:, india’s gdp is 10 times what it was 20 years ago, when i was first posted in delhi. what was then a closed economy is now our 12th largest trading partner in goods., india is the world’s second fastest-growing major economy, and is projected to become the world’s third largest economy in 2025., india will soon be the world’s most populous country. at a time when much of the industrialized world and china face rapidly declining birthrates, half of india’s population is under age 25, giving india an unforeseen demographic edge., so to move our investment relationship forward, we recently resumed technical discussions with the government of india on a bilateral investment treaty (bit). we believe a bit will provide added confidence to investors, deepen our economic relationship, and support job creation through economic growth in both countries., with 1.2 billion of the world’s consumers, and per capita incomes forecast to grow at a rate of 8 percent over the next several years, india is an enormous market for u.s. goods and services. for that reason, but also because it will support india’s continued rise as a global power, we want to be india’s partner in building the railroads, airports, power plants, and fiber optic networks needed to sustain india’s impressive economic pace. the proof of this potential lies in our trade statistics:, between 2002 and 2010, u.s. exports to india quadrupled, growing from $4.1 billion in 2002 to more than $19.3 billion in 2010. from 2002 to 2010, u.s. services exports to india more than tripled, rising to more than $10.3 billion in 2010. , simply put: we, the united states, are open for business in india. but i don’t want to give anybody the impression this is a one-way street. in 2010, india exported $13.7 billion in services to the united states, roughly balancing exports to the u.s. with imports., if trade continues to expand at its current pace, total two-way trade in goods and services will surpass $100 billion in 2011 for the first year on record. reflecting on the two-way nature of our relationship, india is also a growing source of foreign direct investment into the united states. total stock of fdi has grown at a compound annual growth rate of 35 percent from 2004 - 2009, making india the 7th fastest-growing source of investment in the united states. , with business-to-business engagement at the vanguard of our relations, these statistics point to the potential for even greater innovation and business development between our two knowledge-based societies. the task ahead, therefore, is to continue to open doors for greater private sector engagement. your involvement as leading business participants in this collaboration is crucial., america’s (and india’s) asia-pacific century, i’ve discussed the economic side of the coin – but how will a global strategic partnership between the united states and india affect the rest of the world?, with the fulcrum of geopolitics shifting quickly to asia, india and the greater indo-pacific region play an increasingly important role in u.s. strategy. in a region undergoing rapid change, india stands out as an anchor of both economic dynamism and democratic stability., by virtue of our unique geography, the united states is both an atlantic and a pacific power. we are proud of our european partnerships, and remain deeply committed to our alliances and friendships with atlantic partners. but as president obama and secretary clinton have made clear this week in their travels across asia, our challenge now is to build a web of partnerships and institutions across the pacific that is as durable and consistent with american interests and values as the web we have built across the atlantic. that is the touchstone of our efforts in all the areas i have discussed today., as secretary clinton noted in her recent foreign policy article “america’s pacific century,” u.s. engagement in asia will proceed along six key lines of action: strengthening bilateral security alliances; deepening our working relationships with emerging powers; engaging with regional multilateral institutions; expanding trade and investment; forging a broad-based military presence; and advancing democracy and human rights. india – i would emphasize – plays a key role in nearly every one of these areas., india has long been an asian power in its own right – and signs of its cultural influence can be seen throughout the region. we welcome the fact that india’s outreach is growing toward a comprehensive vision for the east asia region – a ‘look east’ policy that is becoming an ‘act east’ policy. we have placed a priority on deepening our bilateral consultations on asian issues, and look forward to furthering this collaboration when india, the u.s. and japan conduct our first trilateral consultations on economic and security matters., with president obama and secretary clinton firmly in the lead, the united states is making an unprecedented commitment to supporting asia’s promising regional institutions, including the association of southeast asian nations (asean), asia-pacific economic cooperation (apec) forum, the east asian summit, and the south asian association for regional cooperation (saarc), where we are an observer. mindful that this work with regional institutions supplements (and does not supplant) our bilateral ties, we have embraced a call from the region or america to play an active role in the agenda-setting of many of these institutions, not least because it is in our interests that they are as effective and responsive as possible., with the east asia summit, the united states is working with india and other members to make it the premier forum for asia-pacific leaders to discuss pressing security and strategic issues. joining prime minister singh, president obama will be attending the 2011 east asia summit in bali, indonesia, in just a few days, providing the perfect opportunity for the u.s. and india to follow-up the president’s visit last year and to deepen our dialogue about security and economic architectures in asia., likewise, we have partnered closely with india to take full advantage of our observership in saarc to see that the organization fulfills its potential as an engine of cooperation and growth. naturally, a focus on promoting american prosperity means a greater focus on trade and economic openness in the asia-pacific. the region already generates more than half of global output and nearly half of global trade. it is not a coincidence that the three free trade agreements president obama signed into law last month (korea, colombia, and panama) were all with pacific rim partners., so as we strive to meet president obama's goal of doubling exports by 2015 through the national export initiative (nei), we are looking for opportunities to do even more business in asia, with india as a keystone of that effort., as you well know, achieving balance in our trade relationships requires a two-way commitment. that's the nature of balance – it can't be unilaterally imposed. so we are working through apec, the g-20, and our bilateral relationships to advocate for more open markets, fewer restrictions on exports, more transparency, and an overall commitment to a level playing field., a south asian economic renaissance, when considering asian economic integration, we should not forget india’s immediate neighborhood, a region whose prospects for economic growth loom larger than anywhere on earth. historically, trade among the saarc countries has been far below its potential, but india in recent months has made exceptional progress in expanding commercial ties with its neighbors., indeed, as former foreign secretary shyam saran reminded us in a recent essay, south asia is a single geopolitical unit by virtue of history, geography and culture. today the prospects for regional progress are better than they have been in many years., we congratulate the governments of bangladesh and india on their efforts to improve bilateral relations, enhance trade, and resolve longstanding conflicts. sheikh hasina’s landmark visit to new delhi in january 2010 and prime minister singh’s visit to dhaka in september 2011 are but the most visible examples of the two countries’ remarkable efforts to cooperate and build new bridges, presenting a credible model for regional cooperation throughout south asia., we also appreciate the success of india’s free trade agreement with sri lanka, which has quadrupled trade over the last ten years. increased trade has been followed by increased investment, as a number of prominent indian companies have invested in sri lanka, and several well known sri lankan garment companies are now investing in india. , on the open border between india and nepal, the free flow of goods, information, and people has been a positive development for both countries, and the recent breakthrough in implementation of the comprehensive peace agreement promises to open the door for furthering the india-nepal economic partnership. many aspects of this open relationship can and should serve as a model for the rest of the region. , and finally there is indo-pak trade, which i will speak to at the end of my remarks., on the multilateral side in south asia, saarc has charted a path for increasing regional trade, and provides the region with a platform for discussing the technical agreements that will allow regional commerce to fulfill its potential. through saarc, india has championed the south asian free trade area (safta), which we see as an important avenue for fostering increased trade flows and prosperity among all saarc members., full implementation of safta would also enhance opportunities for trade with other countries, including the united states. the observer roles of china, japan, korea, australia and the u.s. have helped expand saarc’s brand across the pacific, but saarc could do much more. though a long way off, a fully implemented safta would provide a strong, stable and transparent framework for investment in the region, and would have the potential to accelerate trade and opportunity for fully one-fifth of the earth’s population., the new silk road and the importance of regional economic synergies, as many of you will remember, secretary clinton outlined a vision of regional economic cooperation, trade liberalization, and increased trade flows in this region last summer in chennai, and again at the un general assembly this fall, referring to it as a ‘new silk road.’ this new silk road envisions a network of economic and transit connections running throughout central and south asia, with afghanistan at its heart. in essence, this new silk road consists of two complimentary components. the first is energy and infrastructure - roads, bridges, railways and pipelines connecting goods, services, and people. the second is trade liberalization – which includes the reduction of non-tariff trade barriers, improved regulatory regimes, transparent border clearance procedures, and coordinated policies that accelerate the flow of goods and services throughout the region., the idea is a simple one: by maximizing the use of transportation and energy infrastructure and actively promoting cross-border collaboration and trade, central and south asia can once again become a bustling hub for global commerce. this is the exact same vision prime minister singh outlined at last week’s saarc summit when he said “the imperative of greater regional integration, of a regional economy without boundaries, is an objective to which india is fully committed.”, because it’s not unreasonable to imagine tajik nuts moving south across afghanistan to processing facilities in india or indian plastic goods heading north to almaty’s green bazaar; entrepreneurs in chennai starting businesses in bishkek, or turkmen gas powering businesses in afghanistan, pakistan, and india., with the rapid economic expansion of china and japan to the east, russia to the north, and india, pakistan and bangladesh to the south, there is unprecedented opportunity for india’s landlocked northern neighbors, including afghanistan, to evolve into a land link for eurasia., how does south asia address growing energy concerns? central asia just happens to be sitting on some of the world’s largest energy and mineral reserves, and has the expertise and will to supply energy-hungry markets in india and pakistan, where new energy resources are desperately needed to power economic growth and development. afghanistan lies in the middle of that nexus., this is not news to the government of india or the indian private sector, both of which have been actively investing in afghanistan for years. whether in agri-business, energy, textiles, extractive industries, construction, transport, logistics, banking, telecom, hydrocarbons, or real estate, current estimates suggest india-afghanistan trade could double to $1 billion by 2012. already, india accounts for one quarter of afghanistan’s exports., in afghanistan’s extractive industries, the indian-led sail consortium is bidding for 1.8 billion tons of high-quality iron ore in the hajigak mine in central afghanistan. with the afghan government planning to issue six additional mining tenders in february/march 2012 – three in copper, two in gold, one in lithium – indian companies are actively preparing bids. the united states strongly supports this indian private sector role in afghanistan., but india’s economic interests in afghanistan don’t stop at extractives: indian companies have built over 700 kilometers of roads in afghanistan, in addition to the new afghan parliament complex. indian companies have also constructed 157 kilometers of double-circuit transmission lines between uzbekistan to afghanistan, and installed 700 pre-fabricated high-voltage transmission towers throughout the country. whether indian companies are building electricity substations outside of kabul, installing solar power generation modules for rural electrification in kandahar, or designing electro-mechanical equipment for hydroelectric projects in herat, the indian government and indian private sector are aggressively pursuing economic opportunity in afghanistan not only for the sake of development, but also because it’s profitable., our vision is a secure, stable and prosperous afghanistan at the heart of a secure, stable and prosperous region. all of afghanistan’s neighbors and near-neighbors, including india, stand to benefit from an end to the insurgency and a political solution in afghanistan., as afghanistan assumes lead responsibility for its own security, it is critical that the international community, including india, remain engaged to ensure that the progress we have all worked so hard to achieve in the past 10 years is preserved and has the momentum to continue. india’s own experience with reconciliation brings a crucial perspective to these ongoing efforts., over the past several months, we have been supporting afghan, turkish, and german efforts to organize a series of important conferences that will strengthen the region’s and the international community’s commitment to afghanistan beyond 2014., at the recent istanbul conference, afghanistan’s neighbors reiterated their commitment to a stable, secure, and economically viable afghanistan, reaffirming the importance of afghanistan-led reconciliation, transition to afghan security leadership, and a shared regional economic vision., in the upcoming bonn conference, we will urge the members of the international community to welcome these regional initiatives and to reaffirm their own commitments to afghanistan as transition proceeds. as our transition to afghan-led governance continues on the security side, bonn will be an opportunity to review how the international community and afghan government can work together on behalf of afghanistan’s political and economic future., indo-pak trade, given the significance of the india-pakistan relationship to this new silk road vision, we applaud pakistan’s cabinet approval of the path to normalize trade relations with india, as determined during the meeting of the indian and pakistani commerce ministers in new delhi this past september., the doubling in cross-border trade envisioned by indian and pakistani commerce ministers within three years is certainly within reach – india’s current global imports are over $328 billion, less than one percent of which come from pakistan., this process of normalization in both directions, including the eventual extension of most favored nation (mfn) status by pakistan and the reduction of non-tariff barriers by india, will lead to expanded economic opportunity and stability for the people of both countries. indeed, a 2007 world bank study estimated that if all these barriers were removed, trade could jump to $5-$10 billion per year. i am sure all of you look forward to seeing further progress, including when the indian and pakistani commerce secretaries meet later this month. but this will be a long-term, step-by-step process, that if fully executed will establish india-pakistan ties as a driver of region-wide growth., conclusion, as president obama told the indian parliament last year, the relationship between india and america will be one of the defining partnerships of the 21st century, rooted in common values and interests. the president said our relations constitute an “indispensable partnership” for the 21st century, stressing that “the united states not only welcomes india as a rising power, we fervently support it, and we have worked to help make it a reality.”",0.13903482880755605,next steps silk road - geoffrey pyatt ' address ficci,"prepared , thank , mr. murari , warm introduction. ’

2011-11-16,cabinet nod for 26 % fdi in pension sector,"the union cabinet on wednesday agreed to partially open the gates to foreign direct investment (fdi) in the pension sector to the extent of 26 per cent, as is now available in the area of insurance, but decided not to mention any sectoral cap in the proposed legislation., in its approval to amendments in the pfrda bill, 2011, the cabinet, however, turned down the parliamentary standing committee's suggestion of providing a guarantee on assured returns on pension fund schemes., the provision with regard to the fdi cap for the pension sector is proposed to be incorporated in the regulations once the pension fund regulatory and development authority bill, 2011, is enacted., cap on a par with insurance sector, explaining the need for the options kept open, an official spokesperson said: “the government is of the view that the fdi cap in the pension (sector) should be at 26 per cent, on a par with the insurance sector. however, it would like to retain the flexibility of changing the cap of fdi as and when required and that is why it has not been kept as part of the bill.”, with the cabinet's approval of some of the amendments proposed, the pfrda bill, which seeks to open the pension sector to private sector and foreign investment, will now be taken up for consideration and passage in the winter session of parliament beginning november 22., panel suggestions, the proposed legislation introduced in the lok sabha on march 24 this year was subsequently referred to the standing committee chaired by bjp leader and former finance minister yashwant sinha for scrutiny. in its suggestions, the committee had wanted the government not only to specify the fdi cap in the legislation itself but also provide for a minimum guaranteed return to pension subscribers., while rejecting these proposed provisions, the cabinet also turned down the committee's suggestion on providing greater flexibility to subscribers on withdrawal of funds from their accounts., essentially, the pfrda bill provides for the setting up of a statutory authority to undertake promotional, developmental and regulatory functions with regard to pension funds., as to why the government has decided not to mention the fdi cap in the legislation is the fact that it has not been able to raise the fdi ceiling in insurance from the existing 26 per cent to 49 per cent as the changes require fresh amendments. as a result, the insurance (amendment) bill has been pending approval since 2008., on the other hand, once the fdi caps are mentioned in the regulations, the government would find it easier to modify the ceilings through an executive order, as and when required., as for the issue of withdrawal, the spokesperson said that the flexibility of withdrawals from funds under the pension scheme would be tightened. “it would be allowed only in case of genuine needs...it would be considered when the need is

2011-11-29,fdi: sourcing from small units will benefit exporters: fieo,"the federation of indian export organisations (fieo) and the consortium of indian farmers associations (cifa) have welcomed the decision of the upa-ii government to allow 51 per cent foreign direct investment (fdi) in multi-brand retail sector stating it would increase exports and benefit the farmers., in a statement issued here, chengal reddy, secretary general cifa, said he believed that this move of the government would help in establishing backward-forward linkage. it will help farmers in establishing producer groups and supplying to retailers directly leading to elimination of middlemen at four or five different levels., mr. reddy said currently 30-40 per cent of all farm produce gets wasted due to an efficient link between the farm and the consumers. infusion of new technology and funds would enable farmers to get inputs on best practices and help them in getting extension services., the statement said producer groups would be able to get assured price as they have to enter into agreement with the retailers for continuous supply and said the fears of small traders being affected were unfounded as large retail outlets would be established only in mega cities covering perhaps 10-15 per cent of the population., he said cifa felt that this move would encourage farmers to become producer groups and have better bargaining power in future and competition among indian and foreign retailers would increase competitiveness and fetch better price and services to farmers., he said crop holiday and farmer suicides were directly related to failure of marketing which was a glaring failure of the agriculture sector. fdi in multi-brand retail will help in finding a solution., on the other hand, ramu s. deora, fieo president, said the 30 per cent sourcing from domestic small units, artisans, craftsmen and cottage units would provide further boost to exports. units supplying to large retailers will achieve requisite quality and price competitiveness to graduate to exports. this will largely benefit exporters of textiles, leather, gems and jewellery, handicrafts, jute, coir and other lifestyle products. “this will also create jobs in these sectors and enhance their capabilities as retail buyers buy in bulk for their global re-distribution. chile has been largely benefited with multi-brand retail in pushing its exports of wine and fruits across the globe,” he said.",0.05950577200577201,fdi : sourcing small units benefit exporters : fieo,"federation indian export organisations ( fieo ) consortium indian farmers associations ( cifa ) welcomed decision upa-ii government allow 51 per cent foreign direct investment ( fdi ) multi-brand retail sector stating would increase exports benefit farmers. , statement issued , chengal reddy , secretary general cifa , said believed move government would help establishing backward-forward linkage. help farmers establishing producer groups supplying retailers directly leading elimination middlemen four five different levels. , mr. reddy said currently 30-40 per cent farm produce gets wasted due efficient link farm consumers. infusion new technology funds would enable farmers get inputs best practices help getting extension services. , statement said producer groups would able get assured price enter agreement retailers continuous supply said fears small traders affected unfounded large retail outlets would established mega cities covering perhaps 10-15 per cent population. , said cifa felt move would encourage farmers become producer groups better bargaining power future competition among indian foreign retailers would increase competitiveness fetch better price services farmers. , said crop holiday farmer suicides directly related failure marketing glaring failure agriculture sector. fdi multi-brand retail help finding solution. , hand , ramu s. deora , fieo president , said 30 per cent sourcing domestic small units , artisans , craftsmen cottage units would provide boost exports. units supplying large retailers achieve requisite quality price competitiveness graduate exports. largely benefit exporters textiles , leather , gems jewellery , handicrafts , jute , coir lifestyle products. “this also create jobs sectors enhance capabilities retail buyers buy bulk global re-distribution. chile largely benefited multi-brand retail pushing exports wine fruits across globe , ” said .","{'bjp': 0, 'cong': 0}",0,0

2011-11-30,the retail counter-revolution,"the players displaced would consist of not only smaller retailers but also medium and large wholesale dealers who would be rendered irrelevant by the ability of large conglomerates to contract with and procure directly from producers. file photo , in predictable fashion, the manmohan singh government chose to ignore voices of opposition and implement its agenda of permitting foreign investment in the retail trade. while parliament was in session, the cabinet met to approve the hitherto prohibited foreign direct investment in multi-brand retail, with a cap of 51 per cent on foreign equity that ensures majority ownership. simultaneously, the cap on foreign equity investment in single-brand retail has been enhanced to 100 per cent, offering sole ownership rights to foreign investors., large international retailers are bound to use the opportunity to get a share of the large indian market. foreign sales have been an important source of revenue for many of them amounting in 2007 to as much as 74 per cent in the case of ahold of netherlands, 52 per cent for carrefour of france, 53 per cent for metro of germany, 22 per cent for tesco of the united kingdom and 20 per cent for walmart of the united states. walmart's 20 per cent too has to be seen in context: with $379 billion of revenues in 2007, it stood way ahead of carrefour, which came in second with $123 billion in the global league table for revenues., power of the chains, the power of these chains has been amply illustrated in other contexts, where they have been in operation. with deep pockets and international sourcing capabilities, they exploit economies in procurement, storage and distribution to outcompete and displace domestic intermediaries in the supply chain. this occurs not in one or a few centres, since each retail chain tends to establish procurement, warehousing and distribution facilities across regions and cities. once the smaller middlemen are displaced, we have a few large firms and their agents dealing with a multitude of small, medium and relatively large producers on the one side, and a mass of consumers, on the other., the relationship with producers is that of an “oligopsony,” with a few buyers and a large number of sellers. with consumers, it is one of an “oligopoly” with few sellers and a large number of buyers. structurally, this provides the basis for an increase in margins at the expense of prices paid to producers or charged to consumers. the new “middlemen” appropriate these higher margins. that a part of the margin may be shared with the producer or consumer to increase retail volumes and market shares does not take away from the fact that the distribution of power within the supply chain benefits the large intermediary. in the medium term, it is the dominant position of these large players that would influence the size and direction of margins., thus, on the production side, the danger is that the prices paid to and returns earned by small suppliers, especially in agriculture, would be depressed because a few oligopolistic buyers dominate the retail trade. given the precarious viability of crop production even at present, that shift could severely damage livelihoods. on the other hand, once the retail trade is concentrated in a few firms, retail margins themselves could rise, with implications for prices paid by the consumer, especially in years when domestic supply falls short., within the supply chain itself, it is to be expected that the players displaced would consist of not only smaller retailers, stretching from kirana stores to street vendors, but also medium and large wholesale dealers who would be rendered irrelevant by the ability of large conglomerates to contract with and procure directly from producers. the immediate and direct effect would be a substantial loss of employment in the small and unorganised retail trade as well as in segments of the wholesale trade displaced by the big retail chains., the potential significance of this impact can be judged from the role of the retail and wholesale trade in generating employment in the country. according to the national sample survey office's survey of employment and unemployment in 2009-10, the service sector category that includes the wholesale and retail trade (besides the much smaller repair of motor vehicles, motorcycles and personal and household goods) provided jobs for 44 million in the total workforce of 459 million., it is no doubt true that the impact of foreign-invested retail would be restricted to the urban areas since entry as of now is permitted only in cities with a population of more than one million. but this is where the employment in trade would be the highest. twenty-six million out of the 44 million employed in the sector are located in urban areas. many of these workers find themselves in the services sector (especially in the retail trade) because of inadequate employment opportunities in agriculture and manufacturing. out of 71 million jobs in services in the urban areas, around 36 per cent are in the retail and wholesale trade and repair services. in sum, from an employment point of view this is a sector that is central to livelihoods, however precarious some of those jobs can be. it is a poor substitute for the missing social security programme., questionable claims, the government's claims that the entry of large retail led by transnational firms would not make a difference to net employment and would, in fact, augment it substantially are questionable. they exaggerate the direct and indirect employment that large retail would create and ignore the number of jobs they would displace. the requirement that the foreign investor should bring in a minimum investment of $100 million implies that the fdi being sought is in units that are more technology- and less labour-intensive. on the other hand, the attempt to temper the adverse impact on employment by restricting entry to cities with populations exceeding one million is without substance. it does not change the source of the competition (giants like walmart, carrefour, tesco and metro) nor the locations in which such competition is most likely to be faced., yet, the commerce minister's claim is that the policy has a “unique indian imprint” that would make its impact here very different. this is a poor effort to obfuscate issues. consider one aspect of the unique imprint: the requirement that 30 per cent of manufactured or processed products sold should be sourced from small and medium enterprises. this requirement based on a process of self-certification that is to be monitored would be difficult to implement even in india. but it becomes meaningless because it applies to such producers from anywhere in the world. as a briefing paper from the commerce ministry notes, in order to ensure that there is no violation of world trade organisation norms, “30 per cent sourcing is to be done from micro and small enterprises which can be done from anywhere in the world and is not india specific.” this would be impossible to implement and will only encourage international sourcing at the expense of domestic producers., rushed decision, in sum, there is little to justify the rushed decision to open up to fdi in retail. as of now the retail chain works well, there are no noticeable shortages, and a large and diverse country is well serviced. none but the government argues that fdi in retail is a remedy for the relentless inflation the country faces. the weak segment of the supply chain is the public distribution system created to ensure remunerative prices for farmers and reasonable prices for consumers. that and productivity enhancing public investment are what need the government's attention., not surprisingly, the decision to permit fdi in multi-brand retail has not been received well domestically. an opposition, which was already engaged in highlighting the failure of the government to rein in inflation, corruption and the generation of black money, has responded with anger. parliament remains stalled and non-functional, keeping in suspension other important issues and bills that need to be debated. some allies of the congress in the upa have also had to express their opposition to the move., whether those deciding the economic policy of the upa would budge and retract is yet to be seen. given the on-going debate on the subject, the government must have anticipated opposition to its executive decision. but it possibly presumed that it can hold its position and win out at the end. the tussle is, therefore, likely to be long and socially wasteful.",-0.007428138528138531,retail

2011-12-02,chinese retailers give global giants run for money,"a hebei farmer sells his produce in a beijing neighbourhood. photo: ananth krishnan | photo credit: ananth krishnan , even as the issue of 100 per cent foreign direct investment in retail has set off a major controversy in india, the chinese experience offers a refreshingly positive tale to tell., almost two decades after china opened up retail fully, starting with allowing 26 per cent fdi in 1992, the sector has seen rapid growth, against the backdrop of increased market consolidation, higher production efficiency enabled by rising investments in rural infrastructure, and booming exports made possible by the setting up of new supply chains., many of these changes, according to chinese analysts, were made possible by the entry of foreign retail giants such as walmart and carrefour, who changed the way chinese companies managed their businesses, from farm procurement to logistics. yet, 20 years on, it is chinese local retailers — and not their foreign competitors — who dominate the retail market, with initial fears of a foreign invasion ultimately appearing unfounded as local companies learned quickly to out-compete their foreign rivals., the country's biggest retail firms today are all chinese companies — the shanghai bailian group, suning, gome and dashang — all have bigger sales than walmart in china, according to several research studies., walmart, which came to china in 1996 and has since opened more than 350 stores, has seen its market share fall from 8 per cent to 5.5 per cent in the past three years, according to the china market research group., shi yongheng, a professor from the school of economics and management at tsinghua university who has studied china's retail sector, told the hindu in an interview that the success of china's local retailers was enabled by the government controlling the speed of the ‘gradual' opening up process, which gave local retailers enough time to adapt., foreign companies were allowed to hold 51 per cent majority ownership (which india has now decided to grant them) only 12 years after the sector was opened, first allowing 26 per cent foreign equity. initially, china also only allowed foreign retailers to open in select metropolises, such as beijing, shanghai and shenzhen, and, moreover, only in certain districts in those cities. in beijing and shanghai, foreign retailers like walmart were only allowed to operate in districts where there were no local competitors. through these ‘ invisible barriers', china succeeded in giving local retailers protection, while, at the same time, they learnt from the ‘more efficient' business models of foreign companies, said professor shi., “in terms of logistics, procurement and management, we have clearly seen the benefits,” he said. “prices have fallen, and efficiency has increased. initially, we had fears of the coming of foreign companies, but now we are no longer concerned as local companies have been able to learn from them, and compete with them.”, the lessons for india from china's fdi experience are, however, both limited and mixed, considering the differences in how retail operates in both countries., for one, it is unclear if india can pose the barriers that challenged foreign retailers in china, starting right from land — foreign retailers here have complained of not being given land by local governments, who control all land transactions, in prime locations. the unorganised retail sector is also far larger in india, with organised retail accounting for less than 5 per cent, compared with 20 per cent in china. in china, unorganised retail, represented by street vendors and neighbourhood ‘community retailers', has continued to thrive, offering cheaper prices than supermarkets and retail chains., for farmers like zhang wei (named changed) from hebei, who grows vegetables on a 10 mu (0.67 hectare) plot of land, the coming of retail has increased — not reduced — his client base, he said. mr. zhang has direct sales in a beijing neighbourhood every evening, while also supplying a supermarket chain, which, he says, pays less for his produce. “my vegetables are cheaper than in the supermarket, so i will always have my customers,” he said., consolidation of the retail sector in china, as a result of the government-supported rise of local retail giants like bailian, has put many small farmers, who, unlike mr. zhang, could not cope with lower prices, out of work., it has, however, also improved productivity by increasing the size of landholdings. in mr. zhang's village, for instance, each household had between 1 and 2 mu, but as more farmers moved to the cities for work, they rented out their land to those, like mr. zhang, who stayed behind.",0.019866334963737558,chinese retailers give global giants run money,"hebei farmer sells produce beijing neighbourhood. photo : ananth krishnan &#124;

2011-12-03,the cost of open skies,"india’s aviation industry has been lobbying for a government bailout. with kingfisher airlines on the verge of bankruptcy, there are a number of ideas on how the bailout can be delivered: getting oil companies to lower aviation fuel prices, reducing taxes on fuel, persuading banks to restructure debt and offer new credit on easier terms, and changing the rules to allow foreign airlines to bring in capital in return for equity., according to reports, promoters and top executives of leading private sector airlines met the prime minister late november to make their case. their arguments went along expected lines: aviation fuel costs amount to as much as 40 per cent of operating costs; fuel prices have risen sharply; government taxes tend to push up prices even more; and aviation fuel prices in india are as much as 70 per cent higher than elsewhere in asia. the net result according to them is a substantial loss that is challenging their viability. so the state must step in to rescue the airlines., the sense is that the prime minister is inclined to intervene in their favour, though matters like fdi in retail have postponed the decision. under other circumstances the pm’s stance may have appeared normal. the airline industry is an important part of the country’s infrastructure and the fuel price hike is an external shock threatening the survival of leading players. but fuel prices affect not only the airlines. directly and indirectly they affect every segment of the population, including the poor and the middle classes. yet the government in recent times has been clear that it will not go back on its decision to reduce fuel subsidies by doing away with the administered pricing mechanism and will stick with its policy of adjusting domestic prices when international prices change. nor will it forego revenues by cutting duties on fuel any further. money, the prime minister is reported to have said, does not grow on trees., this difference in approach when it comes to preventing the erosion of the real incomes of ordinary citizens and to protecting the profits of the airlines is a striking anomaly. it is explained by the fact that part of the mess in aviation today is because of the government’s open skies policy. that policy was influenced by the view that opening up the airline industry to new and multiple private operators would enhance competition, reduce prices and improve the quality of customer service., one danger, however, is that “competitive markets” often result in failure. wrong decisions leading to excess capacities, price wars that reduce margins and just plain bad management can lead to losses and the bankruptcy of one or more players in the market. according to the votaries of the market mechanism this is inevitable. so when losses occur for these reasons, governments should not intervene but should let markets work. if some firms go bankrupt, so be it. it is merely the way in which the market imposes its discipline, penalising wrong decisions or poor management, and delivering a meaner, leaner and more efficient industrial landscape., however, despite having opened up the airline sector on grounds such as these, the government has been reluctant to stick by these principles. in the kingfisher case, it now transpires that the ailing airline has been on life support from three sources among others: huge volumes of credit from the banking sector, including public sector banks; a conversion of part of the loans provided by banks into equity such that the banks hold 23 per cent of the shares in the airline; and short term credit from the oil distribution companies on the aviation fuel being consumed by the airline. it has been known for some time now that the company had accumulated losses that exceeded its equity and reserves. but it was when the airline could not meet its bills for aviation fuel and the oil companies stopped supply on credit that the cancellations and the crisis began., the story of how we got here is linked to the government’s liberalisation drive since the 1990s. the justification for that drive was that long years of monopoly ownership of the public sector in the airlines business had resulted in inefficiency and high costs and low profits or losses in air india and indian airlines. nobody would defend these public sector firms as being the paragons of efficiency. but the fact of the matter is that a whole host of “extraneous” factors affected the profits of air india and indian airlines., to start with, the functioning of these public sector entities was driven by objectives other than sheer profit. for example, they were required to fly on a number of unprofitable routes to ensure connectivity in a geographically large nation, including on routes to remote locations with relatively sparse traffic. internationally, air india was the nation’s carrier ensuring connectivity not just for commercial profit but for reasons related to diplomacy., in sum, the profit criterion was for long subordinate to other objectives for the national carriers. this, however, did result in the misuse of the “freedom”, leading to unwarranted costs and losses that were ignored. to boot, with the ministry of civil aviation combining in itself the role of policy maker, investment decision maker and day-to-day monitor of the airlines operations, the companies were subject to excess intervention, were made the victims of wrong investment decisions and were forced to engage in activities that may not have been commercially or socially appropriate. even now, for example, there is a controversy surrounding decisions with regard to aircraft purchases made before air india and indian airlines were merged. those acquisitions, which would require air india to pay out huge sums when it has accumulated losses are seen as inappropriate in terms of route management and on financial grounds., given this evidence, what was required in the airline industry was an all out effort to revamp indian airlines and air india. the revamp should have sought to ensure greater autonomy in functioning, institutional change to ensure transparency in investment and operational decision-making, and appropriate governance and monitoring mechanisms. rather than focus on such changes, the government sought to induct private initiative into the airline industry on the grounds that the competition will improve overall efficiency., as a result of that indiscriminate opening up, over the years the business has seen the entry of a large number of private players. knowingly or unknowingly these investors had bought the argument that the only reason for the poor profit performance of the public sector airlines was their incompetence. any number of efficient operators that could keep costs down and offer better services at a cheaper price would be able to quickly turn a profit. the net result was irrational investment, excess capacity on many routes and severe price competition on some. the government’s view was that this was merely a temporary process of adjustment. wrong decisions by private operators would lead to a “shake out” and some airlines would close down and others would survive, resulting in a fitter, leaner and more customer-friendly industry., initially it appeared that this was indeed occurring. small airlines like nepc and bigger and stronger ones like modiluft and air deccan had to close or sell out. but, over time, for each airline that was shrinking or closing there appeared to be more than one emerging. and most were expanding their fleet and routes quite significantly. the irrationality of private decision-making under the market mechanism was more than visible., kingfisher was a relatively late entrant into the business with a business model the matched its promoter’s flamboyance. it would cater to the upper end of the market where the distinction between economy class and business class ended. and when air deccan ran into financial difficulties, promoter mallya decided to acquire that company and combine his “luxury”, full-service airline (kingfisher) with a no-frills twin, kingfisher red. all this was occurring at a time when the market was already showing signs of saturation, fuel prices were volatile, and cost consciousness was the prerequisite for survival. and decisions to expand that were not grounded on a viable business plan were a way of courting disaster. in the event, when rising fuel prices put pressure on costs, the kingfisher myth was shown to be what it was: more a show than a business., however, the problem with kingfisher did not catch public attention for two reasons. first, it managed to fund much of the business with outside money, especially money in the form of credit from the banks. second, it managed to reduce the cost of this capital by getting the banks to convert a part of this debt to equity. interest on debt has to be paid even when a company makes losses. but dividends on equity need to be distributed only if profits are made.",0.04233536099915411,cost open skies,"india ’

proper to make disclosures at this juncture., asked if names of indians holding swiss accounts will be revealed in the coming year, he said, “yes”., information about such accounts “which will affect india” will be revealed in the coming year, he said., he said since mr. elmer was jailed and facing legal action, he would not like to comment on the issue at the moment., “for that reason, unfortunately i cannot speak about information related to swiss accounts in great detail... we must protect our people,” he added., the australian whistleblower said governments in some countries are “sucking out” data from emails and internet transactions and passing on this “economic intelligence” to companies like walmart., he made some startling revelations about “hacking” and “hijacking” of data of unsuspecting people., mr. assange maintained that the national technical research organisation (ntro), which he termed was india’s equivalent of the national security agency of the u.s., was engaged in similar kind of surveillance under the cover of keeping track of “islamic terror”., however, there were no known instances of the ntro sharing such information with private companies., mr. assange said emails, transactions done through credit and debit cards as well as information sent on the internet, “go through the pacific (ocean) and u.s.” and are intercepted in the name of national security and to combat terrorist threats., “part of this mission is to provide economic intelligence to companies like walmart, lockheed martin and boeing. they (security and private agencies) suck up this intelligence and use it for economic benefits,” mr. assange said., he, however, maintained that he did not have any proof of the beneficiary companies paying for this kind of information., walmart is one of the companies which would be able to set up shop in india after the recent government decision to allow 51 per cent fdi in multi-brand retail., mr. assange claimed that two indian companies were helping india’s external intelligence unit — the research & analysis wing (raw) — in electronic surveillance of emails and mobile phone calls. he said such acts were done with or without the collaboration of service providers., “a big french surveillance company was helping (libyan dictator) qadhafi to keep an eye on people,” he said, adding that the company also boasts of capability in surveillance in hindi and tamil., mr. assange said around six years back when he was involved in research in this field, he had come across information that the chinese had hacked into the central bureau of investigation’s system and was “sucking out” information for its purpose., such information was being used by some credit and debit card companies as well, he alleged., “we are giving away an extraordinary degree of our liberty about our life. i don’t think one should. indian sovereignty is directly affected by these companies,” he said., mr. assange said during the last u.s. elections in which barack obama became president, a major issue was the alleged hacking being done by a prominent multinational telecommunications company of that country., however, mr. assange said india with its right to information law and transparency was “one of the best” countries on the issue of right of people to know., he rued the complexity and secrecy resorted to by the surveillance companies and alleged that these firms “fundamentally operate and thrive” outside the rule of law., they terrorise people into not reporting these instances, convincing them that “the chinese may invade or the russians may throw a missile” at india if this was done, he said., in another observation, he said a “transnational elite” was moving close to each other cutting across national and regional barriers., mr. assange described countries like the u.s. and the u.k. as “totalitarian surveillance states” and maintained that some regimes were behaving like the erstwhile

(if you went by the recent “desi boyz”, it's now the men who are ready to take off their clothes to make a quick buck.), dying off-screen too, most of these stereotypes have become extinct because they're a dying breed off-screen. if films are a reflection (however exaggerated or illogical at times) of the world we live in, here are the cues to how india has changed. if ramu kaka, the faithful old retainer, makes very few appearances these days, it is a reassuring sign of the way our feudal society had evolved into a more egalitarian one., equally telling are the new staples, thrown up by a society that has changed dramatically since “sholay”. most of them are near-caricatures in the hallowed tradition of bollywood but they are slowly evolving. the pouting model with her anglicised hindi accent crops up all the time, for instance. madhur bhandarkar had a bevy of them in “fashion”, but mercifully kept his lead role realistic. the gay fashion designer, limp-wristed and camp, has become another favourite. indeed, the queer character is a near-staple now, though only a handful of movies treat him with any kind of realism. the lesbian has yet to make her mark in a-grade bollywood, but the day should come soon., the investment banker, smooth and well-dressed, has replaced the wealthy but vaguely labelled ‘ businessman'. hrithik roshan took this character to its apogee in “zindagi na milegi dobara”, but lesser clones abound., then there's the terrorist, a grim reflection of our dangerous times, often painted in semi-sympathetic hues (just as the daku was in earlier days) — remember “fanaa” and “kurbaan”? that other baddie, the underworld don, has replaced the smuggler in his den. no more crocodiles, secret doors or evil laughter; it's the latest in designer suits and slick automatics for our present-day dons.",0.09292272404212704,cinema - bye bye basanti,"mums : self-sacrificing mum "" deewar "" . photo : special arrangement , say sholay never re-made. agree — reasons ' probably thinking. question : basanti? , let explain. characters ramesh sippy ' timeless classic , made 1975 , transposed times practically loss transition. even costumes. check out. , jai : brooding rebel , laconic sense humour.

2011-12-12,fdi in retail — upa ‘retired hurt’,"foreign direct investment in retail may be on hold, but hillary clinton can stop worrying about anand sharma and pranab mukherjee., “how does (commerce minister) sharma view india's current foreign direct investment guidelines? which sectors does he plan to open further? why is he reluctant to open multi-brand retail?” those were among the questions u.s. secretary of state clinton posed in a cable to her embassy in new delhi in september 2009, some months after prime minister manmohan singh began his second term. (>see: hillary checks out pranab, and the competition, from the hindu-wikileaks india cables series: march 18, 2011)., note her pointed query on opening up ‘multi-brand retail.' she had other worries, too. “why was (pranab) mukherjee chosen for the finance portfolio over montek singh ahluwalia? how do mukherjee and ahluwalia get along?” and “does sharma get along with mukherjee and prime minister singh?” they get along fine, hillary, and they're all in it together, as a team., hillary has reason to be concerned about fdi in retail. there's the tens of thousands of dollars she earned from serving as a director on walmart's board. and the other thousands of dollars contributed to her 2007-08 campaign by walmart executives and lobbyists. an abc news report on that in 2008 also observed that as a director, hillary clinton remained “a loyal company woman” (clinton remained silent as wal-mart fought unions: abc news, january 31, 2008)., and she surely knows the upa's fdi retreat is tactical. pranab mukherjee put it with disarming candour: we don't want mid-term polls. hillary too had flip-flopped during her election campaign, going by the abc news report. (while on its board of directors, she had said: “i'm always proud of walmart and what we do and the way we do it better than anybody else” — june 1990.), yet, hillary's campaign website of 2007-08, points out the abc news report, omitted “any reference to her role at walmart in its detailed biography of her.” as the race heated up, she recanted: “now i know that walmart's policies do not reflect the best way of doing business and the values that i think are important in america.”, perhaps hillary's fdi concerns are loftier. she must be worried about the poor indian farmer. the wonderful thing about the fdi-in-retail debate is the explosion of concern for agriculturists. never have struggling indian farmers found so many champions. they've been crawling out of the woodwork ever since the fdi announcement. from deepak parekh to ratan tata, they've suffered sleepless nights, agonising over the small farmer., they might want to take a look at the american farm population. at their family farms, especially smaller ones, wrecked by corporate monopolies at every level, from giant agri-businesses to mammoth retail chains. presently less than one million americans claim farming as their occupation. that figure was over 25 million in the 1950s., with what credibility does our regime, on whose watch farm suicides crossed the quarter-of-a-million mark, speak of helping farmers? who knows what windfalls the deals struck with retail giants have brought to individuals in this most corrupt government in our history? we need to embrace that old journalistic principle: follow the money. (hillary does, though in a very different way.) meanwhile, look at our government's claims., who it affects, doing away with the ‘middleman': the first to be devastated will be that poor ‘middlewoman' — the vendor who daily provides our towns and cities with fresh produce. she did not push up the prices and has her modest margin squeezed each time they rise. that woman carrying that huge basket to your doorstep, on her feet 14-16 hours a day to feed her family. she's the first ‘middleman' target., the more exploitative middlemen in the chain will be co-opted by giant retail which needs collectors and contractors, though not so many. it will slash their numbers after a while. this is the mob taking over from the little guys on the block. you're looking at massive displacement in the agricultural supply chain. only, the new ‘middlemen' will be cardin-clad and gucci-shod, with better access to government than the farmers everyone's dying to save., that poor woman vendor, whose life we need to improve, not destroy, brings you fresh produce. she has to, or she can't sell it. (tip: big retail operators pasting the words ‘natural' or ‘fresh' against their names are selling you stuff that could have been refrigerated, even frozen, for days)., ten million jobs: try not to die laughing. this comes from a school of economics that has gifted the world jobless growth for three decades now. we worked hard for two of those, making a big expansion of jobs impossible within our policy framework., from the early 1990s, fantastic claims have been made of small farmers gaining from neo-liberal globalisation. for instance: farm incomes would rise 25 per cent if indian prices were aligned to global prices; purchasing power would shoot up., many steps were taken on such claims, including 100 per cent fdi in sectors like seed. all achieved the opposite. these moves helped double the indebtedness of the peasantry and further spurred the worst-ever recorded wave of suicides. apart from which we've seen seven-and-a-half million people abandon agriculture in a decade, many driven out by policies to ‘benefit the farmer.' now we should believe that fdi in retail will undo all the damage that these policies — from the very same authors — caused? and these guys predict 10 million jobs within a year?, the upa wants to open up a sector that for all its awful flaws and hardships presently employs 44 million people and has total sales of close to $400 billion. (that's about 20 times the number walmart employs on roughly the same turnover.) and gives some sustenance to many millions more if you think families. small shops and ‘big box retail' can co-exist, so croons the corporate choir. sure, after wiping out countless thousands of tiny shops, the survivors can ‘co-exist' with the big guys, who might even have minor errands for them to run. india's powerful will run the more important errands. that was clear from 2005 when then walmart international division chief john menzer told his company's annual meeting: “in our six government meetings, we created a very positive image of wal-mart…” and: “we've energized the fdi lobby and preempted the anti-fdi lobby in india.” (wal-mart's hot in india, cnnmoney.com, june 6, 2005), efficiency: the giant chains can never match the efficiency of farmers' markets selling food produced locally or nearby. their sourcing of produce from all over the world, central warehousing systems, giant transport operations — all these are hugely energy intensive. which means a lot of what you get is old and much-refrigerated or frozen. know the other costs of what you pay for., benefitting farmers: here's a paradox. just when we march determinedly towards super markets, people in the homeland of big retail are buying more and more from “farmers' markets.” that is, the oldest form of direct marketing by small producers. more and more americans seek decent produce not drowned in chemicals, pesticides and preservatives. growing numbers of that nation's small and family farms are selling through farmers' markets each year. in india, every market was once a farmers' market. over time, farmers have lost control of such markets to traders and moneylenders. now comes the coup de grace.",0.1120059288537549,fdi retail — upa ‘retired hurt ’,"foreign direct investment retail may hold , hillary clinton stop worrying anand sharma pranab mukherjee. , “how ( commerce minister ) sharma view india ' current foreign direct investment guidelines ? sectors plan open ? reluctant open multi-brand retail ? ” among questions u.s. secretary state clinton posed cable embassy new delhi september 2009 , months prime minister manmohan singh began second term.

2011-12-27,legitimising an inhumane discourse,"new delhi, 07/12/2011: scene at a store in khari baoli whole sale market in delhi, the government's decision to allow foreign direct investment (fdi) in retail ended after an all-party meeting passed a resolution to suspend the move till a consensus was reached, both houses resumed the winter session after a logjam on fdi in retail, in new delhi on december 07, 2011. photo: v.v. krishnan | photo credit: v_v_krishnan , the upa government mercifully has decided to keep in abeyance its decision to allow 51 per cent foreign equity in multi-brand retail. what is disturbing however is the argument with which it sought to justify its earlier decision, which represents a shift towards a palpably inhumane discourse in matters of economic policy. one must protest against this shift before it becomes “acceptable.”, the official argument stated that fdi in multi-brand retail would benefit “consumers” (whoever they are), and peasants and small producers from whom the retail mncs would procure supplies. let us for a moment accept these arguments, notwithstanding their vacuity (>exposed by c.p. chandrasekhar in the hindu, nov. 30). nobody however has claimed that the induction of retail mncs will not harm the small retailers. even the government's own argument that confining retail mncs to cities with more than ten lakh people will limit the damage to petty retailers, actually concedes that such damage will occur. there is, of course, an element of dishonesty involved in this argument: since it is not worth mncs' while to set up shops in villages, what is claimed as a restriction upon them conforms precisely to what they want anyway; but the argument itself vindicates the critics. and since the bulk of employment in petty retail at present is in urban areas, the fact that fdi in retail will cause substantial damage to the livelihoods of vast numbers of people is indubitable. promoting it therefore is based on the presumption that distress for them should be acceptable because of the benefits that would accrue to other sections of society., this argument however is dangerously violative of a humane discourse. it is analogous to saying that since the processing of minerals will bring benefits, by way of availability of manufactured goods, to some sections of society, the distress caused to the tribal population which has to be uprooted for obtaining the minerals should be of no concern. and it is exactly identical to the argument put forward in the colonial context that since imported manufactured goods were of superior quality and benefited the consumers (who would not have bought them otherwise), among whom were numerous peasants, the fact that they destroyed the livelihoods of millions of artisans and weavers, should not be held against the policy that freely allowed such imports. in fact the argument for fdi in retail is a precise recreation of the discourse of colonialism., it is instructive here to recollect the rhetorical question that gandhiji had asked: if “my brother” the weaver is out of work because of imported cloth, then how can i be better off by it? the humaneness of this discourse was the foundation upon which our anti-colonial struggle was built, and we came into being as a nation. the current official discourse constitutes a rejection of it., interestingly, the current official position is antithetical not only to the humane discourse that gandhiji was propounding, which postulated that no section of the population should consider itself better off by some policy if certain other sections belonging to the non-affluent were pushed into greater distress by it, but also to what even conventional economic theorising suggests., vilfredo pareto, the italian philosopher-economist, had suggested a criterion for comparing alternative states of society, which has acquired wide currency in economics. according to it, between social states a and b, if there are some persons who are better off, and nobody is worse off, in a compared to b, then a is socially preferable. on the other hand, if some persons are worse off in a compared to b while others are better off then we cannot say that a is to be preferred to b. taking a to be the social state where mncs are operating in retail, it clearly follows that we cannot consider their operation to be socially preferable to a state where they are not operating., the pareto criterion has major lacunae, the most obvious being that it flies in the face of egalitarianism. if the poor continue to remain as poor in a as they were in b but the rich become much richer, then a is socially preferable to b according to pareto despite the increased inequality. not many would accept this view: egalitarianism may override pareto, but not the converse. but in the case under discussion, if we introduce egalitarian considerations in addition to pareto, then the argument against mncs in retail gets further strengthened. not only will their operation, no matter whether it benefits some sections of society, hurt others, but those hurt will include a substantial number of the poor. both pareto and egalitarianism therefore point in the same direction, namely, jettisoning the move to introduce fdi in retail. what is intriguing is that a government headed by an economist should have ignored this basic bread-and-butter economics., even if we keep egalitarianism aside, just to pass the pareto test, the least that the proposed policy should have provided for is a system of compensations, effected through the government budget, for those who stand to lose by it, to be paid for by those who stand to gain from it. but then it may be asked: who exactly stands to gain from it? the government's answer to this question is palpably absurd. the insertion of some gigantic mncs which would act as oligopsonists vis-à-vis the sellers of produce, consisting of a set of peasants and petty producers, and as oligopolists vis-à-vis the buyers, consisting again of a set of relatively small consumers, is bound to act to the detriment of both these sets. international experience, contrary to the claims of the central government, testifies to this. but let us for the moment accept for argument's sake the possibility that a large number of people may gain from this move. of one thing however we can be absolutely certain, namely that the mncs will gain from it. it stands to reason therefore that the mncs should be asked to pay for compensating the petty retailers who will lose from their entry, and that they in turn can recoup this by charging whoever gains from their entry. (and if this makes transactions with them unattractive for buyers or sellers, then so much the better, for it will then serve to prevent the supplanting of petty retailers)., for the introduction of fdi in retail to be at all a credible measure for consideration, it is essential therefore that it should be accompanied by a system of compensations for the losers, for example in the form of an income guarantee scheme for the petty retailers. even with such a system of compensations, fdi in retail can still be objected to on grounds of violating egalitarianism; but without such a system it is simply not worth considering at all. and if such a system of compensations is considered infeasible on administrative or any other grounds, then too it follows that fdi in retail is not worth considering at all., the process of destruction of petty business by capitalist enterprises was referred to by marx as “primitive accumulation of capital.” while marx had seen primitive accumulation as occurring at the beginning of capitalism, it obviously characterises the entire history of capitalism which is marked by violence and predatoriness. but unleashing a process of primitive accumulation of capital, such as what fdi in retail amounts to, is not only violative of humaneness, but also undermines both democracy and the foundations of our nationhood. having a system of compensations, say in the form of an income guarantee for petty retailers, is one way of preventing primitive accumulation of capital. it still does not make fdi in retail acceptable; but it makes it minimally worthy of being placed on the table for discussion.",0.03935728250244381,legitimising inhumane discourse,"new delhi , 07/12/2011 : scene store khari baoli whole sale market delhi , government ' decision allow foreign direct investment ( fdi ) retail ended all-party meeting passed resolution suspend move till consensus reached , houses resumed winter session logjam fdi retail , new delhi december 07 , 2011. photo : v.v. krishnan &#124; photo credit : v_v_krishnan , upa government mercifully decided keep abeyance decision allow 51 per cent foreign equity multi-brand retail. disturbing however argument sought justify earlier decision , represents shift towards palpably inhumane discourse matters economic policy. one must protest shift becomes “acceptable. ” , official argument stated fdi multi-brand retail would benefit “consumers ” ( whoever ) , peasants small producers retail mncs would procure supplies. let us moment accept arguments , notwithstanding vacuity ( >exposed c.p. chandrasekhar hindu , nov. 30 ) . nobody however claimed induction retail mncs harm small retailers. even government ' argument confining retail mncs cities ten lakh people limit damage petty retailers , actually concedes damage occur. , course , element dishonesty involved argument : since worth mncs ' set shops villages , claimed restriction upon conforms precisely want anyway ; argument vindicates critics. since bulk employment petty retail present urban areas , fact fdi retail cause substantial damage livelihoods vast numbers people indubitable. promoting therefore based presumption distress acceptable benefits would accrue sections society. , argument however dangerously violative humane discourse. analogous saying since processing minerals bring benefits , way availability manufactured goods , sections society , distress caused tribal population uprooted obtaining minerals concern. exactly identical argument put forward colonial context since imported manufactured goods superior quality benefited consumers ( would bought otherwise ) , among numerous peasants , fact destroyed livelihoods millions artisans weavers , held policy freely allowed imports. fact argument fdi retail precise recreation discourse colonialism. , instructive recollect rhetorical question gandhiji asked : “my brother ” weaver work imported cloth , better ?

2012-01-24,wanted: a communications policy,"the cable television networks (regulation) amendment bill 2011, passed in parliament recently, makes full digitisation of cable television across the country mandatory in three years. pictures shows a view of the dish antenna installed by the arasu cable tv in thanjavur. file photo:m. srinath | photo credit: m_srinath , the wave of consolidation in the television industry over the last few days has been reported mainly as a commercial story. but the implications extend far beyond the media industry per se. we are in a new phase of media growth, with greater economies of scale for business promoters, and far more viewing options for those who can afford them. affordability for the wider public is the subject that remains a big question., india's democracy rests among other things, on a free media, but this may soon change in one important respect. the cable television networks (regulation) amendment bill 2011, passed in parliament recently, makes full digitisation of cable television across the country mandatory in three years. the rationale is that digitisation will provide more and better channels, and value-added services that benefit the consumer. cable service providers and broadcasters will be able to monitor their subscriber base, determine what channels they get and at what price — decisions the local cable operator used to make., but most importantly, digitisation enables large corporates to control a greater segment of the hitherto fragmented television market. note that the largest cable service providers are already owned by broadcasting companies: star owns hathway cable, zee owns dish, and sun owns sumangali cable vision. since the bill passed, reliance industries has invested in tv18, and has announced plans to acquire a 26 per cent stake in cable operators. with the expected doubling of revenues due to digitisation, we can expect further consolidation, with telecom companies acquiring more stakes in the media. big players will grow much bigger, and small businesses will suffer., one immediate result will be that consumers can no longer negotiate rates and viewing options with their local cable operators (lcos). currently, broadcasters claim they receive only about a quarter of the fees that viewers pay for their programmes, because lcos under-report subscribers and gain disproportionate revenues., lcos, of whom there are more than 60,000, have been crucial in making cable service available across the country, albeit through mostly non-legal means. the bill will prevent them from bypassing the digital set-top box, and deciding the mix and price of channels according to locality and customer base. the bill will also shift the balance of power away from lcos to cable service providers and tv broadcasters, and ensure that the latter control the flow of revenues. this fact is ignored in most of the celebration that has greeted the new legislation., market forces may decree that millions of viewers can no longer afford the television service they have had many years, unless the government takes pre-emptive steps. and in a context where media self-regulation has become the credo, such action by the government will be regarded as interference by the industry, and needs to be defended with a communications policy. there is none at present., growth of media coverage and expansion of the audience reached have always been presupposed in indian media policy, and were meant to serve state goals of information, education, and entertainment. today it is an article of faith that only the market can efficiently provide media to the people., broadcasting for most of the post-independence period was considered part of the national infrastructure, and was treated as a natural monopoly of the state. today media industry leaders suggest the government should consider television as a non-essential item, and as an optional commodity. in other words, we are asked to believe that what was infrastructure has suddenly become superstructural and akin to a disposable good. but there is no reason to adopt such a view., like roads, railways and electric power stations, television communication, or telecommunication, is also infrastructure. infrastructure provides the raw materials, e.g., food, energy, and information, to make the environment we inhabit and shape. infrastructure thus connects the visible and the invisible. hence it is both ‘hard' and ‘soft.' thus telecommunication's ‘hardness' is reflected in broadcasting towers, cable and satellite dishes. it is also ‘soft,' being composed of sounds and images, of oral, written and body language, through which we perceive and communicate with others. infrastructure thus has both technological and cultural aspects. when television becomes privatised, that is not simply a series of individual private choices but a matter of collective concern, and the government has to consider its implications for society., television is the source of information for the largest number of people across the country. it is true that doordarshan even in its heyday was watched for its films and entertainment rather than for its news and current affairs programmes. today commercial tv has created many more venues for public discussion and debate through news, current affairs, reality tv, and entertainment. meanwhile doordarshan's viewers are mainly rural, poor, and lack other options. those who have had the means to choose have gone for commercial channels. this was possible because local cable operators offered services based on people's ability to pay., broadcasters and cable companies can, by contrast, maximise revenues to deliver value to their shareholders. the subscriber base may decrease, but corporates expect to make more money through the operation of market forces. and the new bill has been passed without any guarantees for the poorest viewers who can be offloaded if they cannot afford market rates., sixty per cent or more of india's population is estimated to lack food security. will they spend on television rather than on food? or should the government treat television as a public utility, as some states are now doing, and subsidise consumer access to it?, if the latter happens, the media industry is clearly worried that content regulation by the state will be next on the agenda. but by trying to downplay the significance of communication, the industry is only making it more, not less, likely that the government will step in. what is needed is a more intelligent and proactive stance, acknowledging that an emerging market is also an emerging public, one whose attributes cannot be treated as fixed. that requires a visionary communications policy and not simply a focus on the bottom line., unlike china, india has chosen a slower and more incremental path of social change. whereas china's communications policy emphasises conformity with state ideology, communication in india needs to be both a medium of dissent and a means for promoting reform., the information and broadcasting ministry was until recently such a crucial portfolio that only senior politicians took charge of it. it was considered a stepping-stone to higher things. indira gandhi, i.k. gujral and l.k. advani were i&b ministers. two became prime minister, and the third, deputy prime minister. it is in the liberalisation era that i&b diminished in importance. the airwaves became decontrolled in this period, and the ministry's revenues began to decline, partly because the government saw the success of the media and entertainment industry as showcasing economic reforms., this meant that the broadcasting infrastructure built at enormous expense from the 1975 satellite instructional television experiment (site) onwards, that resulted in one of the largest terrestrial broadcasting networks in the world, was quietly de-listed as not a priority sector any more., why? because economic reforms took priority over development-oriented communications. doordarshan mainly emphasised entertainment over news and current affairs as a kind of censorship, to curtail dissent. economic reforms themselves happened without parliamentary debate. stealth, not public discussion, was the vehicle of india's liberalisation. but as the recent debacle around fdi-in-retail should suggest, stealth is no longer a viable means of achieving reforms. india's emerging market has an emerging and argumentative public that needs to be engaged, not threatened or lulled with misleading assurances.",0.11782420166040852,wanted : communications policy,"cable television networks ( regulation ) amendment bill 2011

2012-02-12,making shareholders liable for big banks,"bailing out financial institutions deemed ‘too big to fail' has become wildly unpopular, as people across the political spectrum are now talking about splitting up america's large banks. but such break-ups are probably not the best way forward, because they would penalise size instead of failure., in the light of the financial chaos after lehman brothers' collapse in 2008, companies of its size are now often considered too big to fail. yet before its collapse, lehman had a capitalisation of about $60 billion, compared with the $143 billion capitalisation of jpmorgan chase last week., so the logic of cutting down huge institutions could mean splitting the largest ones into several pieces. yet, banks do not always come in easily divisible parts. such a move could amount to eradicating the largest banks rather than splitting them up and eradication is both politically unlikely and potentially disastrous for the economy. in short, if the resulting parts of a divided bank cannot turn a profit, the split-up may prompt the very bailout it was trying to avoid., another fear is that u.s. money market operations would move to larger foreign banks, which would have a newly found competitive advantage. if a financial problem arose, we would either bail out the foreign banks or rely on a foreign central bank to protect our own interests. neither option seems appealing., even if a breakup went well, the incentives for the new, smaller banks would be unhealthy. those banks could make mistakes or take on bad risks without being punished very much in terms of capitalisation or revenue, because of their legally capped size. even if they made big mistakes, these banks would probably be pushing on the frontier of maximum allowed growth. eventually, the competitive process would cease to make these banks tougher or smarter or leaner, and we would just be cultivating another kind of banking system where bad or irresponsible decisions don't lead to financial failure., most important bank failures spring from correlated risks, like the bursting of a real estate bubble, that affect many banks at roughly the same time. bailing out a large number of smaller failing banks may be easier than bailing out a smaller number of large ones, since it is easier to apply bankruptcy and the procedures of the federal deposit insurance corp. to the smaller institutions. but that outcome hardly gets rid of bailouts., there is still another problem. the more a bank is legally limited in terms of easily measurable size, the more it may resort to off-balance-sheet activities to make up the difference. “breaking up big banks” may really mean making these less-transparent bank activities much more important to a bank's fate., maybe tough new rules for off-balance-sheet activities could limit this problem, but the overall history of financial regulation belies that view. banks are usually wealthier, nimbler and smarter than their regulators, at least when it comes to finding loopholes in the regulations or making their moves more opaque. in any case, splitting up major banks also requires that regulators get some other significant decisions right., there is a better alternative: expanding the liability for major financial institutions. if a shareholder invests a dollar in a big bank, why not make that shareholder liable for the first $1.50 or more of losses as insolvency approaches? in essence, we would be making the shareholders liable for the costs that bank failures impose on society, and making the banks sort out the right mixes of activities and risks. eugene n. white, an economics professor at rutgers university, supported a related proposal in a recent paper, “rethinking the regulation of banking: choices or incentives?”, this proposal would shrink the financial sector, while avoiding excess regulatory micromanagement of bank activities. but it could still be combined with other regulations, like limits on leverage, if deemed appropriate or necessary., unlike the ‘big is bad' view, this proposal would penalize failing banks rather than safe, successful ones that happen to be large. that's also more in accord with the american ethos of winning at business., under this reform, it's quite possible that we would end up with some very large and also relatively safe banks. note that canada, whose banking system has proved remarkably safe over the last century, relies on a small number of major banks., in any case, the market can adjust bank sizes over time, as perceived risks to banks change, without requiring new legislation to ward off each new source of risk. it's hard for the law to win that race, especially when congress is so fractious., expanded liability for bank shareholders might satisfy the occupy wall street movement, and could be sold as a market-oriented, not regulatory solution; it's probably what markets would insist upon if there were no central bank and no fdic. we need to resist vengeful or ‘feel good' options for financial reform and embrace those that will really work.",0.0801343795093795,making shareholders liable big banks,"bailing financial institutions deemed ‘too big fail ' become wildly unpopular , people across political spectrum talking splitting america ' large banks. break-ups probably best way forward , would penalise size instead failure. , light financial chaos lehman brothers ' collapse 2008 , companies size often considered big fail. yet collapse , lehman capitalisation $ 60 billion , compared $ 143 billion capitalisation jpmorgan chase last week. , logic cutting huge institutions could mean splitting largest ones several pieces. yet , banks always come easily divisible parts. move could amount eradicating largest banks rather splitting eradication politically unlikely potentially disastrous economy. short , resulting parts divided bank cannot turn profit , split-up may prompt bailout trying avoid. , another fear u.s. money market operations would move larger foreign banks , would newly found competitive advantage. financial problem arose , would either bail foreign banks rely foreign central bank protect interests. neither option seems appealing. , even breakup went well , incentives new , smaller banks would unhealthy. banks could make mistakes take bad risks without punished much terms capitalisation revenue , legally capped size. even made big mistakes , banks would probably pushing frontier maximum allowed growth. eventually , competitive process would cease make banks tougher smarter leaner , would cultivating another kind banking system bad irresponsible decisions ' lead financial failure. , important bank failures spring correlated risks , like bursting real estate bubble , affect many banks roughly time. bailing large number smaller failing banks may easier bailing smaller number large ones , since easier apply bankruptcy procedures federal deposit insurance corp. smaller institutions. outcome hardly gets rid bailouts. , still another problem. bank legally limited terms easily measurable size , may resort off-balance-sheet activities make difference. “breaking big banks ” may really mean making less-transparent bank activities much important bank ' fate. , maybe tough new rules off-balance-sheet activities could limit problem , overall history financial regulation belies view. banks usually wealthier , nimbler smarter regulators , least comes finding loopholes regulations making moves opaque. case , splitting major banks also requires regulators get significant decisions right. , better alternative : expanding liability major financial institutions. shareholder invests dollar big bank , make shareholder liable first $ 1.50 losses insolvency approaches ?

2012-02-22,"latin america, india's next big thing?","policy wonks in latin america eagerly await the reports of the u.n.'s economic commission on latin america and the caribbean (eclac). based in santiago, with a history of leadership by heavyweights such as raúl prebisch, enrique iglesias and gert rosenthal, and known as “latin america's think tank,” eclac pulls no punches. it is often able to identify emerging trends in the world political economy long before others. uniquely for a u.n. agency, its peer-reviewed journal, eclac review, edited by one of the region's most senior economists, osvaldo sunkel, is a prestigious outlet for path-breaking pieces on international political economy issues., much of the recent work of eclac's international trade and integration division has been on asia and its links with region. a few weeks ago, it released its first report on india and india-lac links. titled india and latin america and the caribbean: opportunities and challenges in trade and investment relations (lc/l346, november 2011), it was just in time for a seminar organised by the indian embassy in buenos aires, “the new india and the new latin america: synergies and complementarities,” in a joint venture with eclac. the report and the seminar's deliberations throw fresh light on one of the hottest topics going these days — the new impetus acquired by south-south trade and investment flows in the wake of the great financial crisis (gfc). they complement last year's reports from the inter-american development bank — india: latin america's next big thing? — and another study released by the latin american and the caribbean economic system, officially known as sistema económico latinoamericano y del caribe (sela), in caracas on the same subject., latin america today, the underlying question is the following: is the glass half empty or half full?, by this i mean, do the relatively meagre absolute numbers of india-lac trade (a little over $20 billion in 2010) or of indian fdi in lac (some $11 billion) tell the whole story? do they merely confirm the long-standing suspicion that only incurable romantics could ever believe in serious economic exchanges between india and latin america, given the sheer geographic and cultural distances between both? or, as others would have it, do the ongoing trends and the enormous rise in trade and investment links over the past decade point in a different direction?, much depends on our assessment of which side is right in this debate, and the jury is still out on this. raúl rivera, an innovation guru and author of a recent best-selling book, nuestra hora, soon to be out in english, pointed out in buenos aires that, for a variety of reasons, latin america has developed a reputation for being a small, fragmented region, racked by conflict and populist dictators. nothing could be further from the truth. in terms of land mass, with some 20 million square kilometres, latin america has a larger surface than either russia or canada, the two largest countries. it is the region with the largest bio-capacity and biodiversity, and the one with the biggest fresh water reserves anywhere. almost all countries have now democratically elected governments. it is also a peaceful region, with few inter-state wars in the course of the past 100 years, and, accordingly, with the lowest defence expenditures. its economy as a whole, measured in purchasing power parity (ppp) terms, is the fourth largest in the world — bigger than japan's, and only behind the eu's, the u.s. and china's., over the course of the past decade, it has also become one of the growth poles of the world economy and thus a natural partner for india. with a population of 580 million, a gdp of $4.9 trillion (four times larger than that of india) and six per cent of the world's merchandise trade, it has shown remarkable resilience in the face of the gfc. although its gdp fell by 1.7 per cent in 2009, its recovery was swift, growing at 6.1 per cent in 2010, and at a (projected) 4.5 per cent in 2011. this is in marked contrast to many european countries now on the verge of bankruptcy and a united states still in the throes of the recession., this is, then, the new latin america, open for business. its solid macroeconomic and fiscal management, as well as prudent financial and banking supervisory practices, have put the economies of the region on a sound footing. the region grew at an average of five per cent from 2003 to 2008, its best performance in 40 years. much progress has been made in lowering poverty. expanded trade with asia buttresses the commodities boom that undergirds its steady growth. this leads us to india's role in the region, or more precisely, that of the new india. the latter's gradual, but steady, opening to the world economy, its high savings and investment rate, and rapidly expanding middle class, whose demands for western consumer products is growing in leaps and bounds, offer enormous opportunities for expanded international trade., the eclac report is emphatic: “the region's trade with india was negligible until the beginning of the past decade. since then, trade with the asian country has burgeoned.” u.s. $20 billion in india-lac trade is not an insignificant sum, though it is highly concentrated, with chile, brazil, argentina and paraguay providing the bulk of the region's exports to india, and brazil, peru, colombia and nicaragua a significant amount of the imports. preferential trade agreements (ptas) with chile and with mercosur have boosted inter-regional trade., going through the trade data is revealing. though latin america's export basket to india is comparable to that of other asian markets — being mostly composed of natural resources and products based on the latter, its imports from india are somewhat different, as “the import basket from india consists not only of manufactures, but also natural resource based manufactures.”, three advantages, latin america, and in particular south america, is becoming a significant source of natural resources for india — oil, copper, soya, and iron ore, among others. a number of economists have warned about the danger this entails, and how chinese and indian demand for commodities could push the region towards its de-industrialisation, and a narrow specialisation as agro-mineral exporting economies. yet, this need not necessarily be the case. the demand for food will continue to expand exponentially in india. it is possible for latin america to move up the value chain in this area, and start to export more sophisticated and elaborate farm products. food security will emerge as a critical issue in years to come, and india-lac partnerships in this area could be highly profitable. the latin american industry also needs to get into the asian value chains that have become such a critical part of international trade., the report identifies some interesting differences between chinese and indian outward fdi. these show the special opportunities indian capital offers to lac. they are basically three: 1) indian fdi is largely fuelled by supply and demand and private companies, whereas the chinese one is mostly led by government 2) india's fdi goes mostly to the developed world and to manufacturing and services, whereas chinese fdi is mainly geared to developing countries and mining, and 3) india's comparative advantages lie in its corporate governance and management, whereas china's are in government strategy and economic diplomacy., india's it and it-enabled services industry have played a major role in india's outward expansion — and latin america has benefited. tcs has established a presence in eight of the larger latin american countries; wipro and evalueserve, among others, are also there. this implies significant technology transfer in a cutting-edge economic sector., so, which is it? is the glass half-empty or half-full?, the answer can be gleaned from what has happened in the past decade. a combination of government initiatives and private ventures opened new vistas in india-lac trade and investment, leading to an eightfold expansion in interregional trade. a steady expansion of state visits in both directions (luiz lula, the former brazilian president, visited india three times in eight years) gave the right signals to the private sector, which followed through in a variety of areas., yet, with this new decade come new challenges. one-off visits and a few trade agreements need to be taken to the next stage. if we want to realise the full potential of india-lac ties, the density of these exchanges needs to be increased. this implies institutionalising them, making them part of the regular agenda of government and the private sector., the eclac report suggests a number of steps. i would highlight three: 1) developing joint strategies for trade and investment promotion; 2) working together on infrastructure, competitiveness and innovation; and 3) launching a series of policy dialogues on inter-regional cooperation.",0.0902679625569236,"latin america , india ' next big

2012-02-22,"latin america, india's next big thing?","policy wonks in latin america eagerly await the reports of the u.n.'s economic commission on latin america and the caribbean (eclac). based in santiago, with a history of leadership by heavyweights such as raúl prebisch, enrique iglesias and gert rosenthal, and known as “latin america's think tank,” eclac pulls no punches. it is often able to identify emerging trends in the world political economy long before others. uniquely for a u.n. agency, its peer-reviewed journal, eclac review, edited by one of the region's most senior economists, osvaldo sunkel, is a prestigious outlet for path-breaking pieces on international political economy issues., much of the recent work of eclac's international trade and integration division has been on asia and its links with region. a few weeks ago, it released its first report on india and india-lac links. titled india and latin america and the caribbean: opportunities and challenges in trade and investment relations (lc/l346, november 2011), it was just in time for a seminar organised by the indian embassy in buenos aires, “the new india and the new latin america: synergies and complementarities,” in a joint venture with eclac. the report and the seminar's deliberations throw fresh light on one of the hottest topics going these days — the new impetus acquired by south-south trade and investment flows in the wake of the great financial crisis (gfc). they complement last year's reports from the inter-american development bank — india: latin america's next big thing? — and another study released by the latin american and the caribbean economic system, officially known as sistema económico latinoamericano y del caribe (sela), in caracas on the same subject., latin america today, the underlying question is the following: is the glass half empty or half full?, by this i mean, do the relatively meagre absolute numbers of india-lac trade (a little over $20 billion in 2010) or of indian fdi in lac (some $11 billion) tell the whole story? do they merely confirm the long-standing suspicion that only incurable romantics could ever believe in serious economic exchanges between india and latin america, given the sheer geographic and cultural distances between both? or, as others would have it, do the ongoing trends and the enormous rise in trade and investment links over the past decade point in a different direction?, much depends on our assessment of which side is right in this debate, and the jury is still out on this. raúl rivera, an innovation guru and author of a recent best-selling book, nuestra hora, soon to be out in english, pointed out in buenos aires that, for a variety of reasons, latin america has developed a reputation for being a small, fragmented region, racked by conflict and populist dictators. nothing could be further from the truth. in terms of land mass, with some 20 million square kilometres, latin america has a larger surface than either russia or canada, the two largest countries. it is the region with the largest bio-capacity and biodiversity, and the one with the biggest fresh water reserves anywhere. almost all countries have now democratically elected governments. it is also a peaceful region, with few inter-state wars in the course of the past 100 years, and, accordingly, with the lowest defence expenditures. its economy as a whole, measured in purchasing power parity (ppp) terms, is the fourth largest in the world — bigger than japan's, and only behind the eu's, the u.s. and china's., over the course of the past decade, it has also become one of the growth poles of the world economy and thus a natural partner for india. with a population of 580 million, a gdp of $4.9 trillion (four times larger than that of india) and six per cent of the world's merchandise trade, it has shown remarkable resilience in the face of the gfc. although its gdp fell by 1.7 per cent in 2009, its recovery was swift, growing at 6.1 per cent in 2010, and at a (projected) 4.5 per cent in 2011. this is in marked contrast to many european countries now on the verge of bankruptcy and a united states still in the throes of the recession., this is, then, the new latin america, open for business. its solid macroeconomic and fiscal management, as well as prudent financial and banking supervisory practices, have put the economies of the region on a sound footing. the region grew at an average of five per cent from 2003 to 2008, its best performance in 40 years. much progress has been made in lowering poverty. expanded trade with asia buttresses the commodities boom that undergirds its steady growth. this leads us to india's role in the region, or more precisely, that of the new india. the latter's gradual, but steady, opening to the world economy, its high savings and investment rate, and rapidly expanding middle class, whose demands for western consumer products is growing in leaps and bounds, offer enormous opportunities for expanded international trade., the eclac report is emphatic: “the region's trade with india was negligible until the beginning of the past decade. since then, trade with the asian country has burgeoned.” u.s. $20 billion in india-lac trade is not an insignificant sum, though it is highly concentrated, with chile, brazil, argentina and paraguay providing the bulk of the region's exports to india, and brazil, peru, colombia and nicaragua a significant amount of the imports. preferential trade agreements (ptas) with chile and with mercosur have boosted inter-regional trade., going through the trade data is revealing. though latin america's export basket to india is comparable to that of other asian markets — being mostly composed of natural resources and products based on the latter, its imports from india are somewhat different, as “the import basket from india consists not only of manufactures, but also natural resource based manufactures.”, three advantages, latin america, and in particular south america, is becoming a significant source of natural resources for india — oil, copper, soya, and iron ore, among others. a number of economists have warned about the danger this entails, and how chinese and indian demand for commodities could push the region towards its de-industrialisation, and a narrow specialisation as agro-mineral exporting economies. yet, this need not necessarily be the case. the demand for food will continue to expand exponentially in india. it is possible for latin america to move up the value chain in this area, and start to export more sophisticated and elaborate farm products. food security will emerge as a critical issue in years to come, and india-lac partnerships in this area could be highly profitable. the latin american industry also needs to get into the asian value chains that have become such a critical part of international trade., the report identifies some interesting differences between chinese and indian outward fdi. these show the special opportunities indian capital offers to lac. they are basically three: 1) indian fdi is largely fuelled by supply and demand and private companies, whereas the chinese one is mostly led by government 2) india's fdi goes mostly to the developed world and to manufacturing and services, whereas chinese fdi is mainly geared to developing countries and mining, and 3) india's comparative advantages lie in its corporate governance and management, whereas china's are in government strategy and economic diplomacy., india's it and it-enabled services industry have played a major role in india's outward expansion — and latin america has benefited. tcs has established a presence in eight of the larger latin american countries; wipro and evalueserve, among others, are also there. this implies significant technology transfer in a cutting-edge economic sector., so, which is it? is the glass half-empty or half-full?, the answer can be gleaned from what has happened in the past decade. a combination of government initiatives and private ventures opened new vistas in india-lac trade and investment, leading to an eightfold expansion in interregional trade. a steady expansion of state visits in both directions (luiz lula, the former brazilian president, visited india three times in eight years) gave the right signals to the private sector, which followed through in a variety of areas.",0.09231876000711617,"latin america , india ' next big thing ?","policy wonks latin america eagerly await

2012-02-23,"capital gains, everyone else loses","tax avoidance through artificial devices — holding companies, subsidiaries, treaty shopping and selling valuable properties indirectly by entering into a maze of framework agreements — has become a very lucrative industry today., a large part of the income of the ‘big 5' accountancy and consultancy firms derives from tax avoidance schemes which flourish in the name of tax planning. their legality has agitated courts in india and abroad for a long time. in 1985, a 5-judge bench of the supreme court in the mcdowell case settled the question decisively, observing:, “in that very country where the phrase ‘tax avoidance' originated, the judicial attitude towards it has changed and the smile, cynical or even affectionate though it might have been at one time, has now frozen into a deep frown. the courts are now concerning themselves not merely with the genuineness of a transaction, but with its intended effect for fiscal purposes. no one can now get away with a tax avoidance project with the mere statement that there is nothing illegal about it. in our view, the proper way to construe a taxing statute, while considering a device to avoid tax is … to ask … whether the transaction is a device to avoid tax, and whether the transaction is such that the judicial process may accord its approval to it.”, “it is neither fair not desirable to expect the legislature to … take care of every device and scheme to avoid taxation,” the ruling added. “it is up to the court … to determine the nature of the new and sophisticated legal devices to avoid tax ... expose them for what they really are and refuse to give judicial benediction.”, ‘legitimate tax planning', despite such a clear pronouncement, two recent judgments of smaller supreme court benches have gone back to calling artificial tax avoidance devices “legitimate tax planning”., though the income tax act obliges even non-residents to pay tax on incomes earned in india, many foreign institutional investors avoided paying taxes citing the double taxation treaty with mauritius. this treaty says a company will be taxed only in the country where it is domiciled. all these fiis, though based in other countries and operating exclusively in india, claimed mauritian domicile by virtue of being registered there under the mauritius offshore business activities act (moba). companies registered under moba are not allowed to acquire property, invest or conduct business in mauritius., yet these ‘post box companies' claimed to be domiciled there and the i-t department allowed them to get away with claiming the benefits of the treaty for many years. given the benign attitude of the indian tax authorities and the fact that there was no capital gains tax and virtually no tax at all on these companies in mauritius, most fiis and most of the foreign investment in india, by 2000, came to be routed through mauritius., the party finally ended when a proactive tax officer tried to stop this blatant evasion. relying on mcdowell, he lifted the corporate veil of moba companies to determine their place of management and actual place of residence. since this happened to be in different countries in europe or north america, the relevant double tax avoidance treaty became the one between india and that country. all these treaties provided for capital gains to be taxed where the gains had accrued. since the gains accrued in india, he levied capital gains tax on these fiis., the cbdt circular, responding to the fiis' distress calls, the then finance minister, yashwant sinha, got the central board of direct taxes to issue a circular stating that once a company had obtained a tax residence certificate from mauritius, it would not be taxed in india., the cbdt's circular was challenged in the delhi high court by azadi bachao andolan and a retired income tax commissioner. the petitioners also pleaded that the government be directed to amend the treaty with mauritius since it had become a tax haven. the high court allowed the writ petitions and quashed the cbdt circular, holding it violative of the i-t act., the government appealed, telling the supreme court that its circular — which effectively offered a tax holiday to fiis — was needed to attract foreign investment. the petitioners responded that tax exemptions could only be granted by parliament, either by amending the income tax act or by the budget passed each year, and not by the government in the guise of such a circular. however, a two judge bench in 2003 called this device an act of legitimate tax planning which could be promoted by the government to attract foreign investment, defied the constitution bench judgment in mcdowell and set aside the delhi high court judgment., in the vodafone tax case, which was heard by a 3-judge bench of the supreme court, the court had the opportunity to correct the transgression of the mcdowell principle in the mauritius case. in 2007, hutchinson telecom international (htil), which owned 67 per cent of hutch essar limited (hel), an indian telecom company, sold its holding to vodafone international (vih bv). both companies announced that hutchinson had sold, and vodafone had bought, 67 per cent of the shares and interest in the indian company for over $11 billion., section 9(1) of the income tax act says incomes which shall be deemed to accrue or arise in india include “all income accruing or arising, whether directly or indirectly, through … the transfer of a capital asset situated in india.”, vodafone's claim, since the transfer of the indian telecom firm's shares and assets to vodafone had led to capital gains for hutch, the it department demanded capital gains tax from vodafone, which was liable to withhold this tax from the amount they paid hutch. vodafone claimed the transaction was not liable to tax since it was achieved by transferring the shares of a cayman island-based holding company and did not involve the transfer of a capital asset situated in india. the high court rejected this contention by holding:, “the facts clearly establish that it would be simplistic to assume the entire transaction between htil and vih bv was fulfilled merely upon the transfer of a single share of cgp in the cayman islands. the commercial and business understanding between the parties postulated that what was being transferred … was the controlling interest in hel. htil had, through its investments in hel, carried on operations in india which htil in its annual report of 2007 represented to be the indian mobile telecommunication operations. the transaction between htil and vih bv was structured so as to achieve the object of discontinuing the operations of htil in relation to the indian mobile telecommunication operations by transferring the rights and entitlements of htil to vih bv. hel was at all times intended to be the target company and a transfer of the controlling interest in hel was the purpose which was achieved by the transaction., “ernst and young who carried out due diligence of the telecommunications business carried on by hel and its subsidiaries made the following disclosure in its report:, “the target structure now also includes a cayman company, cgp investments (holdings) ltd. cgp investments (holdings) ltd was not originally within the target group. after our due diligence had commenced the seller proposed that cgp investments (holdings) ltd should be added to the target group …”, the due diligence report emphasizes that the object and intent of the parties was to achieve the transfer of control over hel and the transfer of the solitary share of cgp, a cayman islands company, was put into place at the behest of htil, subsequently as a mode of effectuating the goal.”, following mcdowell, where the supreme court had decisively frowned upon tax avoidance schemes, the high court rejected vodafone's contention that this transaction was not liable to tax. but in appeal, a supreme court bench of 3 judges headed by chief justice kapadia accepted vodafone's claim that the capital gain had arisen only from the transfer of the single share in the cayman island company and had nothing to do with the transfer of any asset situated in india., despite the fact that the entire object and purpose of the transaction between hutch and vodafone was to transfer the shares, assets and control of the indian telecom company to vodafone, the supreme court declared in january 2012 that the transaction has nothing to do with the transfer of any asset in india!, with such welcoming winks towards tax avoidance devices, it is unlikely that any foreign company would be called upon to pay tax or at least capital gains tax in future in india. thousands of crores of tax revenue, and the future attitude of the courts towards innovative tax avoidance devices, will be shaped by these two judgments., the vodafone case is in the lineage of the mauritius case inasmuch as both encourage tax avoidance devices ostensibly to attract foreign investment. the 2g judgment of the supreme court cancelling 122 telecom licences granted four years earlier, in sharp contrast, enforces the constitutional principle of equality and non-arbitrariness. the proponents of fdi are groaning that this will stem the flow of investment. honest foreign companies should not be deterred by this judgment, which strikes a blow against crony capitalism. but even if fdi becomes a casualty in the enforcement of the rule of law, so be it., our courts must send a clear signal that india is not a banana republic where foreign companies can be invited to loot our resources and even avoid paying taxes on their windfall gains

2012-02-27,heed the warnings,"c. rangarajan , the prime minister's economic advisory council (pmeac), headed by c. rangarajan, has just released its review of the economy for 2011-12. in many ways, the review flags off the budget season. its views and analysis are bound to be echoed in the economic survey, the union budget and the railway budget. the reserve bank of india has scheduled a policy review in march. while its interest rate policy will remain in focus, the central bank's views on the macroeconomy count far more than they ever used to. in short, there is going to be no dearth of economic information in the coming weeks. the publication of the review is just the beginning., it is always fashionable to look at what these official bodies say on economic growth during the current year and the next. but despite their headline grabbing nature, growth forecasts by the council or the finance minister ought to matter less than the policy agenda that these institutions commend to achieve, among other objectives, a certain level of economic growth., therefore, the council's expectations that the economy will expand by 7.1 per cent in the current fiscal and by a more impressive 7.5 to 8 per cent in 2012-13 are relatively less important despite the fact that these forecasts are among the more optimistic by any official agency. the cso, in its recent advance estimate, has said that the economy will expand by 6.9 per cent this fiscal. for 2012-13, other official agencies, including the rbi, are unlikely to be as optimistic as the council. besides, it has been pointed out that the council has, in the past, been ‘behind the curve' in spotting signs of economic slowdown and, hence, pitched for higher growth rate projections., whether that view will gain further credence, when other agencies' forecasts for next year's come in, seems irrelevant at this stage. that would be doing a great disservice to the council, whose overall macroeconomic analysis is the most lucid of its kind anywhere., in its previous reports, the council has been unrelenting in its focus on the ‘twin deficits' — the current account deficit and the budgetary deficit — that pose enormous risks to the macroeconomy. that approach continues., the current account deficit (cad) has been mounting amidst growing risks in the external sector. at 3.6 per cent of the gdp, cad is clearly unsustainable and should ideally be capped at 2-2.5 per cent. oil prices have been rising and exports have fallen, widening the merchandise trade deficit. the council does not expect the eurozone crisis to go out of hand but as long as it remains, india and other emerging markets will face increased risks, besides those connected with shrinking export markets. of particular concern are volatile capital flows., these have become crucial for india's balance of payments. already, diminished net flows have caused the rupee to depreciate sharply, a phenomenon that seems to be checked only recently. a large number of indian companies have forex exposures. managing the attendant risks in a highly volatile global environment has proved daunting., while exports are unlikely to revive spectacularly in the short-term, the only feasible solution is to encourage the inflow of foreign capital. here the official policy has not at all been conducive. in an earlier report, the council has pointed to the paralysis in government decision-making. frequent flip-flops in policy making such as the one concerning fdi in retail do not help in creating a conducive environment., containing the fiscal deficit is the other big perennial worry. the finance minister has admitted that the deficit will overshoot the budgetary target of 4.6 per cent of the gdp., the question, therefore, is not whether but by how much. direct tax collections have fallen by some rs.40,000 crore. the disinvestment programme, despite being given a last minute push, will yield much less than estimated. on the expenditure side, the subsidy bill has mounted enormously. the council has observed that the fiscal problem is not structural but remedying it will involve raising food, fertilizer and fuel prices. none of those will be

“networking is also permitted, wherein you can get a station in a town nearby and relay the same shows as in the city. and so, teaming up with rj dheena and dinesh punniamurthy, an academy came into

2012-03-04,the ides of march,"just ahead of the union budget and the reserve bank of india's scheduled interest policy review meeting — both in mid-march — there has been a succession of lacklustre news on the growth front. although, by no means, unexpected, the bunching of not-so-favourable official statistics in a short time further reinforces the strong perception of a downward drift in the economy., the advance estimates pegged gdp growth at 6.9 per cent for 2011-12 compared to 8.4 per cent for 2010-11. the prime minister's economic advisory council (pmeac) has projected only slightly higher at 7.1 per cent. it may be argued that growth rates of around 7 per cent are not unimpressive by themselves and do compare favourably with many other countries. however, in india's case, expectations were unnecessarily raised from the beginning of this year: a gdp growth of around 9 per cent was believed to be achievable. it took the government a long time after other official forecasters and almost all private ones to become more realistic about its growth prospects. such a delayed reaction, for whatever reason, has ill-prepared the government to receive the latest instalments of bad news., data released on monday last showed india's gdp growth at 6.1 per cent for the third quarter of the current fiscal, the lowest in any quarter since 2009. moreover, each succeeding quarter has clocked a lower rate than the previous ones. at this rate, it will be well-nigh impossible to meet the growth projection set by the pmeac or even the advance estimates., the bad news appears to be even worse once the sectoral breakdown of the gdp numbers are analysed. manufacturing continues to present a bleak picture with just half a percentage point of growth recorded in the third quarter, compared to 7.8 per cent in the same last year. in fact, the sector's performance has steadily declined in the earlier quarters for this year., a revival in manufacturing alone holds the key to boosting employment and equally importantly for ushering in broad-based-economic growth., of particular concerning, manufacturing is the fact that there has been no pick up in the investment rate. gross fixed capital formation, as a percentage of the gdp, has steadily declined during the first two quarters of this fiscal. at 30 per cent in the third quarter, it is more than two percentage points below what is was a year ago, mining has contracted for the second quarter in a row. the neglect of this sector will have serious consequences for other crucial infrastructure industries such as electricity. most disquieting has been the deceleration in services, a sector, which till now has bolstered the overall gdp growth., the month of march is going to be extremely critical for economic policy announcements. the union budget and an interest policy review by the rbi are scheduled back-to-back. then, there will be the economic survey and the railway budget. all these, individually as well as collectively, give the broad direction of economic policy. the global environment is still not conducive to growth. increased global uncertainty in the wake of the eurozone crisis has weakened external demand and has been a principal contributor to declining exports from india. compared to europe, the u.s. economy seems to have perked up somewhat but economic growth there is still below potential. thus, in varying degrees, india's two principal export markets are showing signs of weakness., an immediate consequence for india is the deterioration in merchandise trade deficit. the widening trade balance, also caused by rising oil prices, puts pressure on the current account deficit (cad), which, according the pmeac, is slated to rise to unprecedented levels. the challenge is to encourage foreign institutional investors and foreign direct investors to build a comfortable cushion in the country's external sector. plenty will depend on the policy stance here. on the one hand, the government has demonstrated pragmatism by relaxing rules for non-resident investment and increasing the cap for external commercial borrowing. but on the other hand, it has not been able to implement big-ticket reform such as multi-brand fdi in retail.",0.02818287037037037,ides march,"ahead union budget reserve bank india ' scheduled interest policy

halted the government's efforts to introduce fdi in retail; and after backing the lokpal bill in the lok sabha, opposed it in the rajya sabha. this year, she joined opposition chief ministers to railroad the nctc and, for good measure, got mp ratna de to shred the general budget proposals in the lok sabha. “it's called compulsive populism,” an exasperated state official told the hindu., if the trinamool out-opposes the real opposition in delhi, ms banerjee plays chief minister and leader of the opposition, by turn, in bengal., on march 3, four days after buddhadeb bhattacharjee led a procession through kolkata in an open jeep, she followed suit, bringing the city to a halt, accusing the left of maligning her government., in the state, ten months after she won a massive mandate, ending 34 years of left rule in the state, she remains in election mode, as determined to prevent the centre from taking difficult decisions, as she is to reject unpopular, if pragmatic, advice from her officials. instead, she has focused on the optics: after being anointed chief minister at raj bhavan last year, she walked to writers' building through a kilometre-long surging sea of humanity. eight months later, ms banerjee, en route to attend republic day celebrations, alighted from her car at one end of red road — along which the parade passes — and walked to the maidan, where she was to receive governor m.k. narayanan. she ambled down, waving to the cheering crowds: when she arrived, the governor — in a reversal of traditional protocol — was waiting for her., today, ms banerjee still believes she only has to wave her wand, and jangalmahal will be magically transformed into a rural paradise, darjeeling into a land of smiling gorkhas, kolkata into london, and west bengal into india's industrial giant. but the jackboots she wears beneath that fairy godmother costume peep out each time she cracks her whip to make civil servants and industrialists — like her trinamool colleagues — jump through the hoops. in january, she forced a sheepish chief secretary and director general of police (dgp) to repeat her claims on developmental works in front of an audience in maoist-affected jhargram. a few days earlier, she reduced sharp-suited captains of industry and foreign diplomats to schoolboy status: naming them individually from her vantage point on stage at the “bengal leads 2012” business summit in kolkata, she asked them “what their problem” was — why were they not investing in bengal?, that script went awry on march 14: in full tv glare, mr. trivedi refused to reverse the hike in passenger fares, spotlighting not just disaffection in the trinamool, but also ms banerjee's unwillingness — as demonstrated in this year's state budget proposals — to frontally address bengal's economic crisis, the key challenge to her government. currently, as she struggles to pay government salaries, a burden enhanced by 2,75,000 new jobs, state officials despair. “in her first few months,” said one official, “she should have increased resources through higher taxes and raised electricity tariffs. she was so popular she would have got away with it. the longer she waits, the tougher it will get.” this is, especially as delhi has ruled out an economic bailout for bengal., credibility at stake, she's also unwilling to admit that anyone in her party or government can err. last year, she raised eyebrows when she marched into a police station to bail out trinamool hoodlums; this year, her unsympathetic response to a young woman who was raped after leaving a nightclub on kolkata's fashionable park street has become a watershed for the city's middle class, even as growing incidents of rape and political violence in rural bengal in recent days have become grist for the left mill., as ms banerjee's personal credibility begins to take a beating, and there is little on the credit side as far as governance goes, her party colleagues are staining at the leash. trinamool sources told the hindu that mr. trivedi's demotion is fuelling discontent among its mps, with mr. roy's elevation angering them further: they believe his unsavoury past will catch up with him and embarrass the party again. of the party's 19 lok sabha mps, mr. trivedi and poet kabir suman (who'd already gone public with his unhappiness), apart, sudip bandopadhyay, kalyan banerjee, saugata roy, suvendu adhikari, sisir kumar adhikari, sucharu ranjan haldar and somen mitra reportedly figure in the list of the disenchanted., ms banerjee needs to stem the rot, keeping a sharp eye on the muslim vote, before the panchayat polls next year when she will face her first electoral test after she came to power. in last year's assembly elections, she broke the left's hold over the 27 per cent strong muslim population, pushing the latter's vote percentage in the state down to 41 per cent.",0.03576247550128147,"please , someone tell mamatadi chief minister","march 19 , west bengal chief minister mamata banerjee swept imperiously parliament house “persuade ” prime minister manmohan singh appoint mukul roy railway minister , roll back much increase rail passenger fares , hours forced dinesh trivedi put papers. accomplished , pressured congress withdraw candidate rajya sabha seat west bengal , enabling push four instead three nominees upper house , flying back kolkata. congress receive return ? yes , trinamool congress ' back bharatiya janata party ( bjp ) ' amendments president ' address national counter terrorism centre ( nctc ) , mps , ministers included , embarrassed upa government walking houses parliament. , embarrassing upa , part familiar pattern. last year , ms banerjee torpedoed teesta waters agreement bangladesh , embarrassing prime minister ;

2012-04-29,getting growth back,"quick action on some key large infrastructure projects could help rejuvenate confidence. , industrial production data released earlier this month confirmed that the indian economy was passing through a prolonged phase of deceleration. gross domestic product (gdp) growth in the just-concluded fiscal year is expected to have dropped by 1.5 percentage points to 6.9 per cent over the previous fiscal, led primarily by slowdown in industrial growth rate., while the key objective is inclusive growth, adding to purchasing power through targeted interventions defeats the purpose in the absence of sound strategies to expand availability of goods and services. in fact, it puts pressure on prices, as we have seen in the high inflation rates of previous years. the tepid performance of manufacturing is additionally disturbing, since the sector is expected to add millions of new jobs in the next decade. getting growth back thus involves reviving industrial production immediately. the fall in industrial growth rate is preceded by decelerating fixed investment growth rate. private corporate investments, which came down from 14.3 per cent of gdp in 2007-08 to 9.9 per cent in 2010-11, continued to be stagnant in 2011-12. further, as the reserve bank of india (rbi) recently pointed out, foreign direct investment (fdi) inflows to india during 2011 did not recover at the same pace as experienced by other emerging economies., a fresh spurt in growth can only come from boosting investor sentiments, both domestic and overseas. although global conditions over the last year have been vitiated by troubles in the eurozone and sluggish recovery in the u.s., several analysts have pointed to delayed policies as a factor in the current slowdown of the indian economy., what are the immediate steps that would revive flagging investor confidence and get the growth back?, first, monetary policy action to cut interest rates seems to be the most critical factor for the economy today. with costs of other inputs going up, high interest outgo has deferred new investment plans at a time when gaps in infrastructure and large manufacturing facilities are manifest. the rbi annual monetary policy review last week reduced headline rates by 50 basis points, citing lower inflation in recent months. however, in order to really boost investments, we believe that interest rates should be further rolled back by 100 basis points by the end of this fiscal year., second, oil price correction has been on the anvil for some time. passing through some of international oil price increase would send a quick signal to investors., third, the disinvestment process must begin speedily without waiting for markets to trend up. the previous year saw disinvestment decisions being postponed in a volatile equity scenario, and the year ended with disappointing missed targets. this year, the stock markets will continue to be subject to fluctuations, but a disinvestment push itself could help stabilise the situation. perhaps, disinvestment could be conducted in stages over the year., fourth, quick action on key large infrastructure projects could help rejuvenate confidence. rapid implementation of mega projects such as the delhi mumbai industrial corridor, national investment manufacturing zones, roads and highways and power would boost production of cement, steel, and other basic goods, imparting a huge boost to demand. since public private-partnership is envisaged in many of these large projects, undue burden on the fiscal deficit could be minimised. some issues that are coming in the way of investments are land acquisition, slow clearances and environmental issues. clarifications are needed on these matters., finally, foreign investors were concerned over the retrospective nature of tax amendments covering acquisitions overseas of indian assets, as well as other tax measures announced in the budget. the stability and certainty of indian policy is being questioned. there is need to reassure investors that these steps are in line with global best practices.",0.06301471676471679,getting growth back,"quick action key

2012-05-15,"of mines, minerals and tribal rights","tribal and indigenous communities across the world have been asserting their rights to the mineral wealth often found under the land they own or possess or have traditional rights to. they have been historically denied even a share of that huge wealth, leave alone legal rights of ownership. under the contemporary deregulated neo-liberal policy framework, the exploitation and plunder of natural resources, including minerals, by domestic corporates and multinational mining companies has intensified. but the resistance by affected communities across the world has also grown and is reflected, over the years, in the establishment of an international framework through ilo and u.n. conventions, which recognise in varying degrees the rights of indigenous and tribal communities to ownership, control and management of land and resources traditionally held by them either individually or as a community; the right to a decisive role in decision making for development needs in their areas; and the right to prior, free and informed consent to any projects in their areas. while these are encouraging advances won by the struggles and immense sacrifices of tribal communities, what is important is their translation into legal instruments in member countries. the issue has immediate relevance for india, as the upa government has introduced a mining and minerals (development and regulation) amendment bill, 2011 (mmdra), which is presently before the parliamentary standing committee., promoting privatisation, in india, ownership of minerals lies with the state. however, the central government which has control over all major minerals like iron ore, bauxite, copper, coal and most state governments which have control over minor minerals like sand, stone, granite, etc., have promoted privatisation through leasing mines to private companies apart from handing over captive mines of iron ore and bauxite to steel and aluminium corporates like the tatas and birlas. according to a recent report compiled for the industry by ernst and young, of the 4.9 lakh hectares of land given out in mining leases in 23 states by the end of 2009, 95 per cent of the leases comprising 70 per cent of the land were given to private companies., the mmrda bill aims to further deregularise and liberalise the mining sector and encourage privatisation based on the recommendations of the hoda committee. it introduces the concept of high technology reconnaissance, prospecting and exploration licences, and easy terms of conversion to mining leases to encourage the entry of fdi and foreign companies. it also gives weightage, in the allocation of leases, to a set of criteria which favour such companies and also allows them activity on much larger tracts of land than previously. this has adverse implications for equity, the environment and growth., while these aspects need comprehensive analysis, here we focus on those provisions, which claim to address the rights of tribal communities. there is a provision that makes it mandatory for coal mining companies to give funds amounting to 26 per cent of the profits. for other major minerals, an annual amount, which is the equivalent of the royalty paid in the financial year, must be given. while the principle of mandatory payment by companies is necessary, the problem in the mmrda is that these funds are to be under the control of a district mineral foundation dominated by mine owners and the bureaucracy with a nominal representation of local communities. interestingly, in the u.s. where the federal government had set up trusts to manage funds paid by companies using the land on reserves owned by native indians, the government was recently forced to pay a compensation of $1.2 billion to 41 native american communities for “mismanagement of the assets” of the trust and is expected to have to pay another $3.4 billion in a similar case. when the affected people do not have a decisive say in the management of such funds, as in the case of the proposed district mineral foundation in the mmrda bill, “mismanagement” is inevitable. also, rates of royalties in india are notoriously low. until recently, for example, the royalty for one tonne of iron ore fixed by the central government for orissa was just rs. 26. with a low extraction cost of only rs. 250 to 300 per tonne and a high market price around rs. 7,000 a tonne, mining companies made huge profits. while royalty rates have been recently increased, it is still a pittance compared to the profits companies make., patron-client relationship, the very premise of the scheme replicates the patron-client relationship, which has reduced tribal communities into recipients of charity, instead of recognition as owners of the land and its resources. the related provisions of the bill constitute an outright assault on the constitutional rights given to the tribal communities, in particular in fifth schedule areas.",0.08841404358353512,"mines , minerals tribal rights","tribal indigenous communities across world asserting rights mineral wealth often found land possess traditional rights to. historically denied even share huge wealth , leave alone legal rights ownership. contemporary deregulated neo-liberal policy framework , exploitation plunder natural resources , including minerals , domestic corporates multinational mining companies intensified. resistance affected communities across world also grown reflected , years , establishment international framework ilo u.n. conventions , recognise varying degrees rights indigenous tribal communities ownership , control management land resources traditionally held either individually community ;

who is going to give them job? educated youth with no employment is the worst thing that can happen in any country., it is the start of a disaster. it is the start of a civil strife. we must set aside differences, individual whims and fancies of political parties and ensure we don't go down that path. politicians must recognise that something needs to be done in the interest of the country and the economy and the future of our youth., otherwise, if we continue like this, we will go downhill faster in the next two years., foreign funds had poured about $9 billion into stocks and debts between january 1 and march 15; the budget was a huge disappointment — it had no reforms and came up with controversial tax proposals which spooked business sentiment, particularly foreign investment. what went wrong? what are your thoughts, especially on fdi?, foreign investors have lost confidence due to some of the provisions introduced by the government in the budget. the chairman of a big sovereign fund said, “we are not going to go away. we are always interested in india. but till you put your house in order we are not going to invest.”, another chairman said: “it is not possible to work with the present government and it is not possible to work with the difficult tax regime in the country. so, ‘sayonara' to india for the moment.”, there is no justification for the government to hold up plans to allow foreign carriers to invest up to 49 per cent in domestic airlines. we need to open up the aviation sector, which is bleeding and dying., why is the government so sentimental, so emotional? it is a sector that needs foreign capital, and majority ownership would still be in indian hands. there is a major problem with the industry and believe me even other airlines will be forced to close down. i know how precarious their positions are; many are delaying payments to staff as well as for purchases and to airport authorities., the government must encourage fdi, which is more permanent capital than fickle foreign portfolio inflows., but pranab mukherjee said in the parliament that no one needs to think that india is a tax haven?, no one is saying that india needs to be a tax haven, but things in india need to be in black and white. everything today seems to be in grey., there is uncertainty about how laws will be interpreted; there is uncertainty when you start a project whether you'll get all approvals. foreign investors think it is difficult to do business in india; even indian entrepreneurs think so., in fact, the top 10 entrepreneurs have said that it is easier to buy a company abroad and work. no one knows why government approvals take such a long time; and whether they will be given at all, particularly in sectors such as energy, mining, coal and cement. the growth last year has suffered in these areas. energy is critical to achieve higher growth., what are your thoughts on reforms and growth?, we can't just do nothing and expect growth will happen. we need agriculture reforms to begin with., unless we increase our foodgrain productivity significantly and the efficiency of the distribution system is improved, we will not be able to feed the indian population., in agriculture, the cost of distribution in india is the highest. i agree we are a large country and there are pockets where foodgrains are grown. the global average of the distribution cost is one-third of the final price, while the farmer gets 66 per cent. in india, this is reversed because of middle-men, vested interest, wastage and inadequate warehousing facilities., we did a survey in rural india, while health and education for their family are the top two concerns, the other issue was storage and not housing or anything, we have no place to keep our foodgrains. until the food corporation of india man comes, we have no storage place and we have to keep it outside.",0.02370925072537976,things india need black white,"deepak parekh &#124; photo credit : shashi ashiwal , economy going rough patch. growth slowed dramatically tight-fisted monetary policy nearly two years dented consumer spending , delays approvals held several large projects hurt productive investments. , new delhi ' penchant populism inability push much-needed economic reforms coming home roost. trade current account deficits ballooning multi-year highs , rupee enormous strain plunged record lows days together. , finance minister pranab mukherjee policy-makers blame global factors , especially greek debt crisis , india ' economic problems. however , would foolhardy ignore many issues hurting india self-inflicted , domestic factors. interview oommen a. ninan , deepak s. parekh , management guru chairman housing development finance corporation whose sage advice often sought top honchos government , says india ' political class needs pull socks. excerpts : , trouble-shooter financial world. great job rescue scandal-tainted satyam appreciated all. economy big trouble. current account deficit jumped since 1980 rupee plunged record lows. problems needs done retrieve situation?

2012-06-14,"reforms yes, but of the right type","slowdown in the growth of gross domestic product (gdp), a virtual stagnation in industrial production and the risk of losing investment grade rating by international rating agencies like standard and poor's has rattled the government, industry and policymakers. the dominant view — as expressed by influential members of the government and other policymakers — favours the introduction of major liberalisation policies aimed at facilitating the entry of foreign direct investment (fdi) in service sectors like retail trade, insurance, legal and other services as a means of reversing the slowdown. in my opinion, such an approach is flawed. sustained growth is not possible without a healthy and growing manufacturing sector; attracting fdi in the services sector would at best play only a minor role. indeed, india's overdependence on the service sector and the neglect of its manufacturing sector is partly responsible for the deceleration in growth. results from most research studies show that for india, the service sector cannot be the engine for a sustained growth of income and employment. like china, india should also concentrate on the manufacturing sector, for, in the long run, the growth of the service sector would also depend on the manufacturing base., real constraints, research studies, by and large, zero in on two sets of constraints that stand in the way of the development of indian manufacturing sector: physical and government infrastructure. these two are, in a way, related and could reinforce each other. in the last few years, india has not invested sufficiently in physical infrastructure like electricity, roads, ports and railways. this has resulted in huge shortages in electricity supply relative to demand, leading to long hours of load shedding, power holidays and even closure of several manufacturing units. some of the large enterprises have opted for captive electricity generating plants, resulting in high costs and making their products globally non-competitive. small and medium enterprises cannot afford captive power units and they are the main victims of power shortage., likewise investments in roads and railways have been inadequate, hampering the development of the manufacturing sector by increasing the cost of transportation. the presence of corruption and bad governance has made the situation worse. it is common knowledge that only a fraction of the investments on roads and other infrastructure projects actually reach the targeted projects as the leakages are large. this leads to the second set of constraints for manufacturing growth, namely, governance infrastructure., numerous studies show a strong relationship between good (corruption free) governance and investment climate. in the current globalised investment and trade regime, the same set of variables influences both foreign and domestic investment. at present, faced with 0.1 per cent growth rate in the industrial sector, the government is planning to offer interest rate and fiscal incentives to reduce costs and stimulate investment. in this context, it is important to note that corruption is also like a tax that pushes up the costs — the only difference being the sums collected through bribes do not go to the government but to private individuals. thus, given the high levels of corruption, merely reducing interest rates might not be effective in making indian enterprises more competitive., high levels of corruption, in addition to pushing up costs, also adversely affect the quality of investment. it is now fairly well established that corrupt countries mainly receive investments from other corrupt countries, which does not result in technology transfer leading to global competitiveness. thus, bad governance affects both the quantity and quality of investment. moreover, even medium sized indian enterprises are now investing in other countries and import products from their foreign units into india. last year, the fdi outflow from india was more than 60 per cent of the fdi inflow into india. newspaper reports indicate that this year fdi outflows from india could be equal to or even exceed fdi inflows into india. indian enterprises find it difficult to do business in the current indian environment and prefer to set up units in other countries and import the products into india. furthermore, while the manufacturing sector dominates indian investments abroad, foreign investments in india are mainly in the service sector, construction activities and real estate. this alarming situation cannot be reversed without major reforms that target good governance and removal of corruption., scams and reforms, in the last few years, major scams have broken out in resources sectors that are mainly owned by the government — like real estate, mining and ores, and spectrum.",0.02511136712749616,"reforms yes , right type","slowdown growth gross domestic product ( gdp ) , virtual stagnation industrial production risk losing investment grade rating international rating agencies like standard poor ' rattled government , industry policymakers. dominant view — expressed influential members government policymakers — favours introduction major liberalisation policies aimed facilitating entry foreign direct investment ( fdi ) service sectors like retail trade , insurance , legal services means reversing slowdown. opinion , approach flawed. sustained growth possible without healthy growing manufacturing sector ;

2012-06-22,why fears of a foreign hand are real,"pranab mukherjee is likely to be india’s next president. it seemed to be touch and go until the tide turned in his favour. it has been suggested that the corporates swung it for him not because he is one of the most seasoned indian politicians but because they wanted him out of the ministry of finance. he has acted tough on retrospective taxation and gaar – the measures in his recent budget to tackle black income generation. but it would not be surprising if the real pressure was from foreign shores. indian corporates are sensitive to what their foreign counterparts think. so is our political leadership. britain and netherlands exerted strong influence on the vodafone case. how much of our politics is being determined by such pressures?, pressure on polity, several recent events testify that pressure is certainly being exerted on the polity: hillary clinton’s visit to india to influence the government’s policies on trade with iran and on fdi in retail, the s&p downgrade of india, the aircel maxis deal. there are also less visible cases of foreign pressure as in defence purchases (the british were upset at our rejection of the eurofighter), energy sector investments (oil, gas and nuclear), opening of markets and so on., the bofors scam has had a continuing impact on politics since 1987. sten lindstrom, the former head of the swedish police who led the investigations into the bofors-india howitzer deal, recently underlined that there was conclusive evidence that ottavio quattarocchi, a close friend of the nehru-gandhi family, was one of the recipients of kickbacks. his role in swinging the bofors deal at the last minute was known. it is not in doubt that payoffs were made or that the bofors guns are good. the only unsettled issue is who got the money., that mr. quattrochi had powerful friends was confirmed when he was allowed to escape the country during the congress rule. the case was apparently deliberately spoilt by the investigative agencies, including the cbi and, therefore, lost in the courts — in malaysia, britain and argentina. the red corner notice against him “could not be executed” since our police agencies could not “find” him even though journalists could interview him., evidence points to a high level cover up. m.s. solanki, then the external affairs minister, sacrificed his cabinet berth rather than reveal what he wrote in the paper he passed on to the swiss counterpart at a meeting. at that point of time, the swiss bank accounts were being investigated by the indian agencies to trace the bofors payoff trail. could such a sacrifice of a political career be for an ordinary leader?, who took the money even if not rajiv gandhi and why did the investigative agencies spoil the case? investigations are essential to clear the air about these questions. a former minister in the prime minister’s office mentioned to this author in an interview on the black economy that when he went with the bofors file to the then prime minister, he was told to close the file as it could cause a threat to his life. no wonder, none of the non-congress prime ministers changed the course of investigations to bring them on track and none of the congress prime ministers has wanted the truth to come out., kickbacks are common globally. sweden is one of the least corrupt countries in the world but its corporations have bribed to get contracts as the bofors case shows. u.s.-based multinational corporations have resorted to bribes in spite of their being illegal under that country’s law. recently, walmart admitted to having bribed its way through in mexico. when the top management learnt of it, rather than exposing corruption, the internal probe was closed. the same walmart has been trying to enter india. ms clinton’s agenda included “persuading” india to open its doors to foreign retail. the only chief minister she visited was mamata banerjee, the important upa partner opposing fdi in retail. it is reminiscent of henry kissinger and the secretaries of energy and defence flying to india to lobby for enron in the mid-1990s. enron admitted to spending $60 million in india, to “educate” policymakers., it is not just a few mncs that indulge in corruption or use their governments to apply pressure on policies. mnc banks are known to help indians take their capital out of india. ubs bank, the largest swiss bank, was fined $750 million by the u.s. for helping its citizens to keep secret bank accounts. the same ubs bank was allowed entry into india in spite of its known role; was it a reward for helping some powerful people?, executives of siemens, a supposedly honest mnc and an important player in india, were indicted in the u.s. in december 2011 for bribery in argentina. investigations revealed that the company also made illegal payments to the tune of $1.4 billion from 2001 to 2007 in bangladesh, china, russia, venezuela and other countries. these were often routed via consultants. the company paid fines and fees of $1.6 billion to the u.s. and german governments for the bribes it paid across the globe., siemens started bribing soon after the end of world war ii to get contracts under the marshall plan which were mostly going to the americans. since its prosecution, siemens claims to have appointed compliance officers to check bribery. but, with the prevalence of a high degree of illegality internationally, can one company be honest while others are not? how would it win contracts when those in charge expect to be bribed? since non-transparent processes are set up, at every step, decisions need to be influenced, as seen in the bofors case or the 2g spectrum allocation., the vodafone case is significant. mncs (indian and foreign) have used tax havens and tax planning to avoid paying taxes in india. they create a web of holdings to hide the identity of the real owners of a company or who it is being transferred to. in 1985, in the mcdowell case, the supreme court bench observed, “colourable devices cannot be part of tax planning and it is wrong to encourage or entertain the belief that it is honourable to avoid the payment of tax by resorting to dubious methods”. this judgment was overturned in 2003 in union of india vs azadi bachao andolan on the use of the mauritius route to avoid paying tax in india. vodafone took advantage of this judgment to successfully argue against having to pay capital gains tax in india on transfer of a company in a tax haven which owned the indian assets. mr. mukherjee was trying to recover lost ground., dominant interests",0.06356392106392107,fears foreign hand real,"pranab mukherjee likely india ’ next president. seemed touch go tide turned favour. suggested corporates swung one seasoned indian politicians wanted ministry finance. acted tough retrospective taxation gaar – measures recent budget tackle black income generation. would surprising real pressure foreign shores. indian corporates sensitive foreign counterparts think. political leadership. britain netherlands exerted strong influence vodafone case. much politics determined pressures?

2012-07-02,what we do is actually good for the u.s.,"som mittal , president of nasscom | photo credit: g_krishnaswamy , when uncle sam sneezes, india catches a cold. in a networked age, you catch it fast. how far has india been hit by the spreading uncertainty across the western world? som mittal, president of the national association of software and services companies (nasscom), opens up on very many issues in a candid chat with anuj srivas. excerpts:, how has the slowdown impacted the it industry?, we are integrated into both the indian and global economy and, therefore, it surely will always have some impact. however, on the other hand, technology is such a transformational tool. in periods of crisis, people need more technology. the indian crisis impacts more in terms of inflation (as it does anybody) and so on. . also, sometimes you find the decision- making in the government gets slow. this is the time for us to invest in the economy, because this phase will pass. fine we have 6 – 6.5 % growth, which is much less than the 9 per cent that we had. but what were our fundamentals? we were not an export-based economy; ours is a consumption-based economy. people are moving up the social ladder/economic ladder constantly, and because of that, they are becoming consumers. and that has not changed. and, that will not change. it’s just that sentiments will get lower, and we will get pulled down., how has the crisis in the u.s. and eurozone affected the industry will the growth forecast be revised?, looking at the global side, the scenario is a little different. yes, clearly, there was a time where our visibility used to be four- five quarters. now, there is uncertainty. customers take shorter decisions; there are not big-bank projects., our ability to forecast has become less. now it has dropped to two quarters. we have never given a growth range like 11 to 14 before – a clear indication of the uncertainty. but even if you take 11 – 14, the median is 8 – 9 billion dollars of growth, which speaks volumes in itself., banking (and investment banking generally) indeed has become flat, which is a huge business for us. but we are getting into new verticals such as insurance and analytics. there is a lot of thrust on these areas. the good news is that irrespective of where we are, countries will continue to invest – they just move into new fields such as ‘domains’., the upcoming u.s. elections have outsourcing as an important issue. has this accompanying heat and pressure affected the industry? how is nasscom weathering it?, till the u.s unemployment comes down significantly, this debate will always be there. however, the fact is that in the tech space (which is ours), the unemployment rate of college graduates is less than 4 per cent. and, they need highly skilled manpower. in the end, what we do is actually good for the u.s. economy. we are not supplying goods to citizens; we are just improving the competitiveness of the companies that are there. we aren’t supplying shirts or shoes in a cheaper way. in the end, it’s not about india or indian companies. it’s about the u.s. and its economy and they see the benefit. however, there will always be noise, and introduction of new bills. the majority of them will not go through, and we will bring it to the notice of people that some of these bills could be disruptive., we did a recent study, which found that we are responsible for the creation of jobs in the us. last year, we supported 280,000 jobs. we have invested more than 5 billion dollars in fdi through acquisitions and green-field projects. therefore, i think, they are slowly realizing that we are a part of the solution for them. even president obama, while he talks about call centres on and off, is concentrating more on getting manufacturing jobs back in the fields of retail, construction, government, etc. not the tech-industry. the unemployment rate is the highest in those areas, not the tech-space., how has the rupee depreciation helped/hurt it services?, it actually doesn’t help us very much. if you look at in the long-run, a rupee at the level that it is today, would obviously help improve our competitiveness. not profitability, but competitiveness. it takes care of things such as our inflation costs. why does it help us in the short-run though? when we sign contracts, we sign it assuming a particular currency rate. if we signed up a contract, two years back, which was at 49, we covered it at 49. either way, we don’t want the rupee to be either a profit centre or a loss centre., mind you, india is running a huge current account deficit, and it services are the highest value-add exports. ours are almost 65 – 70 per cent value add. i think we are major contributors to the balance of payment in that context and, therefore, the government should help in promoting this. as long as it benefits to remain competitiveness, it is good. a weak rupee at this point, if that is where it will stabilize, will help us in long-term competitiveness especially against other countries., visa standards, procedures, guidelines and acceptance criteria are constantly shifting and changing, what is nasscom doing in this regard?, internationally, we work very closely with all the governments. in most cases, some of these governments mix up immigration with trade. we are not for immigration. we are here for trade. the difference is that our people go on an average for less than two years. (some go for 6, or 8, but on an average.), if you look at the uk case, they have understood this. they have cut down on every other visa except intra-company transfers. we have no quota on intra-company transfers. we have an assurance form the u.k. authorities that for the next two years there will be no change – making it a predictable scenario for us. in case of the u.s, they actually do not have a work-permit, no employment visa. while there are guidelines, the way it is done is subject to a lot of interpretation by them., for example the rejection rates we are facing on l1 visas are because it is for specialized knowledge. the question then becomes how are you going to determine what is specialized knowledge? up till now, everything was working well, but now they have started putting a different yardstick on it., similarly, b1 visas have always been used for training (not working). what was okay then, they are rejecting now. we have provided our suggestions and guidelines, which they have not accepted. but we are expecting new guidelines to come out from cis – citizenship and immigration service (which will be up for debate for 60 days), where will we have a chance to comment on it., this is a top priority for us., what is the roadmap ahead?, growth in the next 10 years is going to come from exploring new geographies, which includes the opportunities here in india. the u.k. and the u.s. are dominating so far. areas such as latin america are going to be looked at next. but looking at a longer-term it should be japan and china (which have the second and third biggest markets) where we are less than 3 per cent., traditionally, we have focused high-tech, bfsi etc. however, the next area would be to look at the public sector – every government has to become more efficient. so, it is public sector, its utilities, entertainment, media, even green areas which are going to be the new verticals.",0.09365087040618957,actually good u.s .,"som mittal , president nasscom &#124; photo credit : g_krishnaswamy , uncle sam sneezes , india catches cold. networked age , catch fast. far india hit spreading uncertainty across western world ?

2012-08-21,‘genetically modified crops no panacea for food security’,"basudeb acharia. ‘we are not against new technology in the farm sector but it should be in the interest of farmers without undermining the rights ofconsumers.’photo: ritu raj konwar | photo credit: ritu_raj_konwar;ritu_raj_konwar - ritu raj konwar , the debate on the pros and cons of genetically engineered/modified crops is universal. in india, in the face of vociferous protests, the controversy has only deepened leading to a moratorium on cultivation of bt brinjal crop — the first gm food crop sought to be commercialised. gargi parsai spoke to basudeb acharia, chairman of the parliamentary standing committee on agriculture, on its new report, “cultivation of genetically modified food crops — prospects and effects.”, the government asserts that gm crops are essential for food security of india’s growing population. what is your take?, gm is not the panacea. we have 2,200 varieties of brinjal. if we allow gm brinjal, all our varieties will get contaminated and vanish as has happened in cotton. when the committee members visited yavatmal in vidarbha, we asked farmers why they were growing bt cotton if the input costs were high and profits were low. they said they had no other option as alternate seeds were no longer available., initially a 450 gm packet of monsanto’s bt cotton seeds was sold at rs 1,700. then after the andhra pradesh government challenged this in court, it was brought down to rs.750 per packet but the royalty of rs.250 per packet is paid to monsanto that developed the seed. last year, a packet was sold between rs.1,200 to rs.2,000 because of the monopoly of this private seed company. an artificial scarcity was created and the price was hiked. this will happen in bt brinjal too if it is allowed., if our quest is for food security then why must we select this technology which has nothing to do with food security? the only motive behind this is profit for the seed companies., what are the major recommendations of your committee?, we have said that the government must not allow field trials of gm crops till there is a strong, revamped, multi-disciplinary regulatory system in place. we studied the regulatory system in different countries and found that the one in norway was the best., we have recommended a thorough probe into the permission given to commercialisation of bt brinjal right from the beginning till a moratorium was imposed in 2010. also that there should be examination of research reports and assessment by independent scientists of bt brinjal by an agency other than the genetic engineering approval committee (geac), which gave approval on its own assessment, to avoid conflict of interest., the panel recommended re-evaluation of all research findings in bt cotton seeds in the light of studies that highlighted inexplicable changes in the organs and tissues of bt-cotton seed-fed lambs., having noticed several shortcomings in the functioning, composition, powers and mandate of geac and the review committee on genetic manipulation (rcgm) in their regulatory role, we have recommended to our sister committees on science and technology and environment and forests to do a comprehensive examination and report to parliament., there should be mandatory labelling of products from gm crops, unchecked import of gm products should be stopped and we have suggested that alternate organic farming should be encouraged, for which, as of now, there is no government support. an explanation has been sought from the department of consumer affairs as to why no examination was done of the lakhs of tonnes of bt cotton seed oil extracted from bt cotton that has entered the food chain., what are the chief concerns?, gm technology cannot be the monopoly of one company, as in bt cotton. the benefits that were assured from bt cotton cultivation are not coming because new pests have appeared. farmers have to use more pesticide and chemical fertilizers, as a result of which there has been an increase in input costs and reduction in profit margins leading to farmer’s indebtedness and suicides., does it worry you that gm foods can enter the country without checks? only if the exporter or the importer makes a declaration will authorities know that gm products are entering the country., that is the weakness in law. there is only a food lab in kolkata under the ministry of health and which is not well-equipped. the new food safety and standards authority of india (fssai) is supposed to do it. the government must enact a legislation to protect the rights of consumers. today, consumers have no rights and no means to know which imported food contains gm. there should be compulsory testing and labelling of gm food entering the country., now that the report is out, what do you expect the government to do?, the moratorium on bt brinjal should continue. all field trials of gm crops should discontinue. they should only be done in confined area in labs, the biotechnology regulatory authority of india (brai) bill should be reviewed so that there is no conflict of interest as the promotion of biotech and regulation cannot be under one body. you cannot compare with the united states as in india, 80 to 82 per farmers are small and marginal., why do you think the government is allowing this?, because of pressure from the united states. because since 1991, the government is pursuing neo-liberal economic policies — all are inter-related. you will find the difference in the agrarian crisis in the pre-1991 and post-1991 period. suicides of farmers started from 1996-97. before that there were isolated incidents. just as it is now — there is pressure from the u.s. on india to allow 51 per cent fdi in multi-brand retail trade so that walmart can come., the industry-based association of biotech-led enterprises-agriculture group (able-ag) has said implementation of your panel’s recommendations will hit farm growth., i do not agree. we were producing 52 million tonnes in 1950-51 and are today producing 257 million tonnes without using gm technology. if we have increased to such an extent, where is the need for gm technology?

2012-08-24,cii calls for transparency in governance to return to high gdp rates of growth,"cii president and godrej group chairman adi godrej addressing a press conference in chennai on friday. , india has to accelerate reforms and strengthen governance to improve investor sentiment that had turned negative in the wake of serial scams that virtually paralysed decision-making, retrospective tax changes and labour unrest, adi godrej, president of the confederation of indian industry (cii) said on friday., addressing a press conference after unveiling the cii theme for 2012-13 ‘reviving economic growth: reforms and governance’ and the agenda to get there, mr. godrej said there was no denying the negative sentiments in the investor community following scams like 2g and coalgate, retrospective tax changes in the budget, the proposed amendments in general anti avoidance rules and the violent labour unrest in maruti’s manesar plant. the high interest rate regime also put a damper on sectors such as automobiles and residential housing apart from slowing down investments., however, the cii president was of the view that some of the statements made by the new finance minister p. chidambaram gave hope of some actions on these fronts that would put the economy back on to the path of 8 per cent plus gdp growth by 2013-14., stressing the need for accelerating policy reforms in areas like the goods and services tax and opening up insurance and multi-brand retail to fdi, mr. godrej also called for transparency in governance, advocating what he termed “less of case-by-case” decision-making by government in the sale of national assets., on its part, the industry should not talk about what is wrong and instead focus on what can done to improve efficiency and productivity, he said., in reply to a question about the impact on policy by the frequent disruption of parliament by opposition parties, he said it was the cii’s wish that the parliament functioned smoothly. he also urged political parties to sink ideological divides and abandon “political grandstanding” and work together for bringing about sustainable and inclusive development., b. santhanam, deputy chairman, cii-sr, added that while scams were a worldwide phenomenon, the issue for india’s image from the controversies was the paralysis of decision-making that led to a perception that nothing moved. instead of becoming mired in an issue like the 2g scam for which no solution has been found even after two years, the government needed to get at the bottom of the truth and move on, he said., supporting fdi in retail as it would benefit farmers and consumers, mr. godrej said the government should at least allow the state that want to attract fdi in multi-brand retail to go ahead. allowing fdi would bring international expertise in logistics and better supply chain management that would reduce wastage and lower costs, he said.",-0.012539026629935708,cii calls transparency

2012-08-24,"""nobody shares pakistan’s vision for afghanistan""","walter russell mead: ‘there is no sign of a lack of desire to continue the beneficial economic relations between the u.s. and india under the obama administration.’ photo: u.s. consulate general, chennai. , on a recent visit to chennai, walter russell mead, a leading thinker, student and teacher of u.s foreign policy, spoke to nirupama subramanian, arvind sivaramakrishnan and raghuvir srinivasan on a range of issues. edited excerpts:, if president obama is re-elected, what would his top foreign policy priorities be, or what should they be?, if president obama is reelected, i don’t expect to see a lot of change in the big priorities. of course, secretary clinton is going to be stepping down, and we don’t know who the new secretary of state is. that would be an important signal about where the administration wants to go. i think the pivot to asia will remain a key element of policy, the us will continue to try to reduce its footprint in the middle east, especially its military footprint, while continuing to watch its interests. the policy of trying to work with moderate islamist groups in the middle east will continue. the effort to avoid a war with iran while persuading the iranians to stop their nuclear programme will also continue. other than that we don’t expect a lot of changes if he’s reelected., we haven’t heard either the president or romney talk a lot about afghanistan in the last few months. why do you think?, the president has announced a policy on afghanistan, and it’s interesting, he doesn’t seem to want to talk about that policy much. i wish he would say more. when you’ve got american troops fighting somewhere, you need to explain to people, including the families of the troops, what you hope they will do and how important it is. but i think the president feels he’s set the war on a strategic course, in line with what he said he would do, and the next point will be when it’s time to start withdrawing troops, is that still going to be possible, what will the schedule be, what kind of political negotiations will be taking place., obviously they’re pursuing consultations with a whole range of partners, some very intensive consultations are going on, not only with pakistan but with a whole host of regional governments that have an interest, others, and possibly they feel that nothing is to be gained by talking about this; they just need to keep advancing the policy. obviously it leaves an empty space, while you have a war that’s going on and you’re not talking about the war, there’s been a kind of patch-up between the u.s and pakistan. where is that relationship headed, and how might it work out if romney were elected?, i don’t see a lot of change in terms of us-pak relations in terms of romney being elected, but governor romney hasn’t shared a lot of his foreign policy ideas. i think that the real factor shaping us-pak relations right now is that nobody in the world shares pakistan’s vision for afghanistan after an american withdrawal. the americans certainly don’t like some of the groups the pakistanis are supporting, but the russians don’t want to see afghanistan become a kind of petridish for all kinds of religious radicalism, the chinese think that’s a terrible idea, the iranians don’t like it, and the indians don’t like it. not only that, a great many afghans don’t like it. so pakistan has set itself objectives in afghanistan that are not very realistic. if i were advising the us on this, i would say, let’s not make us the issue, let reality be the issue, that pakistan is trying to accomplish something it may not be able to accomplish, rather than giving pakistan the opportunity to bash the united states every time reality falls short of pakistan’s hopes. but precisely because so many interests are involved, and because afghanistan itself is such a complicated place, its future is very difficult to predict., when india and the us had the strategic dialogue a couple of months back, the criticism was that ‘the old magic’ was missing. what’s the focus now in the relationship?, india seems to be one of the few countries where you can find a little bit of bush nostalgia. in most of the world, there’s a sense that when we shifted from bush to obama, relations improved. in india, there is this sense that the magic has gone. i actually think there is no partisan divide in the us on the us-india relationship. both democrats and republicans agree on the fundamental importance of a deeper, stronger relationship with india. the weak spot is that to some degree the administration hasn’t talked about its foreign policy enough in the us., …the average american will need to have some understanding of what the united states is trying to do, and it’s the job of the president in my view to tell people what we’re doing and why it’s important …but because we haven’t been having this national discussion over the shift to asia, american-indian relations are taking place without this kind of public discussion and scrutiny that would ultimately strengthen the policy and strengthen the relationship, so in the american election campaign, when people talk about india they talk about outsourcing, rather than about a whole range of interests that in fact tie the countries together., …maybe it would be more accurate to say that the us-india honeymoon has ended, but we’re not drifting apart; the relationship is getting closer and deeper. the interests that are binding us together are becoming more important to both countries. so yes we’re going to argue about outsourcing or retail, there are a whole lot of things india doesn’t like about american policy and there are a whole lot of things the u.s. doesn’t like about indian policy, and we will continue to have these discussions., there is a constant tug within the indian system not to be seen as aligning with the us against china…, the u.s. is not looking for india to be our ally in containing china. that’s a common view of what is going on, but i think the real policy is subtly different; the u.s. is seeking not to win a contest of containment with china but to avoid the necessity of making the containment of china the core of our asia policy for the next 30 years, and the way to do that, in our view, is for asia to demonstrate that it is too big, too diverse, too dynamic for any single power to realistically aspire to the kind of domination say that germany tried in europe, or japan in the 1930s., the u.s. isn’t trying to get india to join some sort of nato alliance in south asia against china, but it wants to see india emerge as a vibrant, dynamic, growing economy, as a power with regional interests and global interests and a vocation and a voice, and that in itself makes a u.s.-china clash much less likely. we’re not trying to get india to do something about china, we’re trying to get india to succeed and prosper and grow, because that advances a lot of our core strategic interests in a way that’s better than an alliance would do. we do want to see india, for its own reasons, grow and involve itself more in asian affairs…in a way that promotes an interconnected and prosperous and peaceful asia-pacific region., you’ve said a great deal about afghanistan. syria gives us a lead-in to the u.s. geostrategic role. is aiding syrian rebels not about aiding syrian democracy but about containing iran?, that’s probably more the focus of the saudis and some of the other regional powers that have taken the lead in arming. people in the u.s. who argue that the u.s. should be doing more for the syrian rebels also argue that the saudis and others will increase the sectarian nature of the conflict by favouring the more sectarian forces rather than the democratic ones. the reason that has not been accepted as policy is more the difficulty of identifying clear groups and forming working partnerships. if the u.s. could achieve what it hopes in syria, it would be that a liberal democratic government that was open to all religious groups would follow assad. the u.s. has been unhappy with the nature of the syrian government for the last 30 years, and may well be unhappy with the nature of the syrian government for the next 30 years., it is also true that for iran to see its regional position more or less shredded in the last few months is one of the factors that certain people in the u.s. hoped would lead the iranian government to reconsider its nuclear programme. that is, the sanctions are far more effective, i think, than most iranians and indeed most people in the world thought they would be. the process of developing a nuclear capacity has taken longer than the iranians expected it would, and the price in terms of their position in the region is tremendous. a year ago iran could convincingly portray itself as the fist of anti-american resistance, pro-islamic resistance to israel. now you have hamas denouncing iran, breaking with iran, which has a tremendously delegitimising effect on iran’s position in the middle east. you have not only the saudis and the gulf states increasingly opposing iran, but you have turkey taking a very strong role here. people have to be, in tehran, looking at this situation as a nightmare scenario, and one hopes that they would then think that if the policies they’ve been trying aren’t working, maybe they’d try some that would work., from a us standpoint, iran has a legitimate and serious role to play in the region. before 1979 iran was one of the closest us regional allies, and a lot of the geopolitical issues that made that alliance sensible still exist today, and there’s a lot of public sentiment in iran, not so much among the top clergy, for a different kind of relationship with the us. the obama administration clearly doesn’t want a war with iran, and it clearly doesn’t want an iranian nuclear weapon, so as events unfold in the region it keeps hoping that something will induce the iranians to make a change of policy. president obama began his administration by reaching out to the iranians; he was deeply criticised in the us for not siding with the green movement in iran at the time of ahmadinejad’s reelection, but he intended to send a signal to the iranian regime that the us really is willing to work with them if they change policy. that is still his position., how worried is the obama administration about the talk that has been coming out of israel against iran, and what is it doing to ensure that that doesn’t spin out of control into something rash by israel?, many of the top us national security officials are visiting israel, to maintain a line of communication and reassure the israelis. the problem is that the us and israel are operating on different timetables vis-à-vis the iranian programme. there’ll be a time when the israeli military no longer feels it has the ability to stop their progress, and there’ll be a time when the us feels it has lost that ability. but those are not the same moment, because the u.s. has the greater ability to act should it decide it needed to. it’s key to president obama’s approach to give diplomacy the absolute maximum amount of time…sanctions are very definitely a part of that, and increasing sanctions in order to have the maximum of time for the iranian government to reflect for different negotiating approached to be tried., …the sanctions don’t hurt the ayatollahs in terms of their personal consumption, but this regime needs public support. from the standpoint of the ordinary iranian citizen you see an unnecessary economic disaster coming as a result of sanctions and a foreign policy disaster in terms of syria and the region uniting against you. people in iran are blaming the regime for these more than foreign forces. iran is not the absolute tyranny that some regimes are; there is a flow of information and communication, there is connection with the iranian diaspora, and public opinion is not happy with what’s happened. i think the regime is encountering obstacles that are an inducement to rethink., has background thinking in us foreign policy moved away from henry kissinger’s balance of power theory?, the work i’ve done on the history of u.s. foreign policy has led me to see both more and less continuity. in the u.s. there are quite different ways of thinking about conceiving the nation and of its international interests and responsibilities, and these are rooted in different subcultures and regions and ideas, and the way the u.s. constitutional system works, none of these voices can ever be permanently excluded from the foreign policymaking process. we’ve set it up so that minorities have all kinds of blocking power; you can’t serve as an ambassador without being confirmed by senate, but any single member of the senate can put a nomination on hold without giving any further reason, and the other senators out of courtesy won’t vote on that nomination…an ambassador has one hundred bosses, and not just one., at any given moment american foreign policy is responsive to several different ideological and cultural forces, and there never is a moment when one of these is in full control. that creates tremendous variations in policy from administration to administration as different as different forces gain or lose power in the internal contest, but at the same time that neglects the long-term continuities that you can see., a realpolitik approach—balance of power, westphalian state—has never dominated, even when kissinger was secretary of state, he still had to accept the human rights declarations as part of the helsinki accords, which he later claimed as one of his greatest triumphs, but was not something at the time he put a lot of weight on., president obama i think is working within three of our four national trends. one is sort of an anglo-american realpolitik, balance of power, state interests, and also commercial interests…a commercially based world order is much more powerful in american foreign policy, even among realists, than a classic metternichian balance of power; and commercial interests might outweigh security interests. that’s one of the reasons kissinger has always felt like an intellectual foreigner in america., another one which is important to obama is the idea of america as the agent of a global democratic transformation…the belief that the cause of war is bad government, and therefore for america to be safe at home we have to get rid of tyrannical, dictatorial, antibusiness government abroad, and obama individually responds to this a great deal. i think that because of his own life history as an african-american, for him patriotism is understood as a belief in the democratic transformation of america itself. he’s admiring what america can become rather than what it has been. and that is linked to some notion of america as a transformative force in the wider world as well as at home., but when he ran for president, he ran from yet another yet another platform, which is that america, in order to preserve its democracy at home, needs to avoid excessive wars and entanglements. so opposed the iraq war, but then he invades sic libya, so to build democracy., this oscillation among schools is characteristic among american presidents. think of jimmy carter, simultaneously trying to reduce america’s global footprint but push human rights….we’ve been doing this for 225 years. we will probably continue to oscillate between these schools for some time to come; they’re deeply implanted in our national identity., where would the lily pads strategy fit into this? the united states has been building very large, effectively permanent bases in iraq and afghanistan, and clark field and subic bay are still us bases under a status of forces agreement., under all the agreements with iraq, the iraqi government has to agree to the use of any bases, and i don’t think people in the u.s. see much chance of that happening. if it came to a war with iran, the saudis and the kuwaitis have been pushing us for a very long time to move faster. people sometimes misunderstand that all the pressure on the us is coming from israel; as much is coming from the gulf and it’s more consistent in some ways. so there’s no shortage of bases, if we’re thinking about iran., the us is actually moving away…to a point where bases of any kind are becoming less important. drones that are being operated form arkansas don’t need the same kind of facilities. some of the early bombing in iraq was carried out by planes which started in the us and returned to the us…an aircraft carrier is a source of strength, but it is also a very obvious target., in a recent interview to an indian news agency, president obama came up with advice for further liberalisation of india’s economy, especially retail, which set off a hostile reaction in the country. what was the president hoping to achieve from the interview?, well, the first thing to say is that he’s running for re-election in the united states and not in india. so his remarks were intended for the domestic audience. there is no sign of a lack of desire to continue the beneficial economic relations between the two countries under the obama administration. the administration to my knowledge is pushing no laws in congress that would restrict trade with india. there are no movements afoot that i have seen to take india to the wto or anything like that. there is nothing than the normal commercial static in a relationship. my advice to people in india would be to wait until they (u.s.) actually do something as opposed to judging a policy by what a politician facing what is a very tough re-election is saying., the other thing i suppose is that president obama enjoys a lot of support from the indian-american community in the u.s. india needs effective spokespersons in the u.s. i think there are a plenty of people who have a foot in each camp, so to speak, who are able to explain in a very clear way to american politicians the importance of this relationship. so my guess is that indian-americans are going to be seen by both sides as a desirable political constituency in this election cycle. so i don’t seen any sign in american politics of an anti-india turn., is too much emphasis being placed by the u.s. on this issue of fdi in retail which is but a small part of a larger relationship?, all i can say is that retail is something the u.s. is actually quite good at. and we are not asking for any special treatment. our retail chains are very good in managing supply chains and delivery and coping with local markets. naturally, when you make up a wish list for another country you include things that you think will be of clear benefit to you. i think there is also a sort of intellectual point here. in terms of unleashing the potential of the indian economy itself, an inefficient retail sector functions as a tax on every kind of economic activity in india. it is true that a lot of studies show that when walmart moves into a particular area, the price of necessities for the poor falls. i will drive out of my way in the u.s. to reach a walmart because i will pay so much less for basic items of clothing, groceries etc. so it raises the standard of living of poor people by reducing the prices that they have to pay for retail., granted, but by bringing it up so directly, will it not be counter-productive because any policy change will be seen as conceding to the u.s.?, well, i think again the indian process has gone in a way that a decision is taken to do something and then a decision is taken to reverse it. so the u.s. reaction is not surprising; after having thought it had an agreement and a commitment and then it turns out that when you say “yes” you really don’t mean an “yes”. if everything that the indian government says its going to do and then the moment there is a political opposition they drop it, from the u.s. point of view the question is: why are we talking to you anyway? we should be doing this more at the consulate in kolkata than in delhi!, this ballooned into a much bigger issue because a decision that was originally reached was not followed up on. but in general the u.s. and india manage these kind of issues all right. i know that there was an issue over the liability clause in the nuclear deal. today i read in the papers that the russians are saying the exact same things that the american did. the russians thought they had an understanding and it turns out they don’t have an understanding and naturally are upset. so, i don’t know that because india changes its mind on something and the other people make an issue of that in negotiations, the other people are responsible for the political problem. that’s certainly one point of view. i think maybe all of us, including the indians need to learn how to deal with this as for the foreseeable future, india is going to have coalition governments. this is a problem for not just new delhi but for anyone wanting to negotiate with new delhi too. as henry kissinger used to say about the european union once, “who do i call up when i want to talk to europe?”",0.1237409305349505,""" nobody shares pakistan ’ vision afghanistan ""","walter russell mead : ‘there sign lack desire continue beneficial economic relations u.s. india obama administration. ’ photo : u.s. consulate general , chennai. , recent visit chennai , walter russell mead , leading thinker , student teacher u.s foreign policy , spoke nirupama subramanian , arvind sivaramakrishnan raghuvir srinivasan range issues. edited excerpts : , president obama re-elected , would top foreign policy priorities , be? , president obama reelected , ’ expect see lot change big priorities. course , secretary clinton going stepping , ’ know new secretary state is. would important signal administration wants go. think pivot asia remain key element policy , us continue try reduce footprint middle east , especially military footprint , continuing watch interests. policy trying work moderate islamist groups middle east continue. effort avoid war iran persuading iranians stop nuclear programme also continue. ’ expect lot changes ’ reelected. , ’ heard either president romney talk lot afghanistan last months. think? , president announced policy afghanistan , ’ interesting , ’ seem want talk policy much. wish would say more. ’ got american troops fighting somewhere , need explain people , including families troops , hope important is. think president feels ’ set war strategic course , line said would , next point ’ time start withdrawing troops , still going possible , schedule , kind political negotiations taking place. , obviously ’ pursuing consultations whole range partners , intensive consultations going , pakistan whole host regional governments interest , others , possibly feel nothing gained talking ;

2012-09-15,critical and necessary move,"good practices: at best price, the wholesale cash and carry storeof bharti walmart pvt ltd., in nidamanuru near vijayawada. photo: ch.vijaya bhaskar. , the cabinet decision on permitting foreign direct investment (fdi) of up to 51 per cent in multi-brand retail is a very welcome and a long overdue step., modernisation of retail is a critical and necessary condition for sustaining high growth impulses in the economy. the entry of fdi with its modern inventory management practices, supply chain management, new storage and vending technologies and advanced organisational skills will go a long way in the modernisation of this sector. with greater investment and new technologies, the sector can act as a growth driver rather than a drag with its outdated practices and inability to take advantage of either economies of scale or of scope., as we have seen in the last few years, the mere entry of large format retail has not resulted in the desired level of modernisation of the sector. those who entered this space were largely from the real estate sector and did not have the necessary technological and management experience to put retail on a qualitatively different growth trajectory. it is to be hoped that fdi will make a difference. while it is true that retail trade does not require rocket science for its modernisation, it is also equally evident that relying exclusively on indigenous efforts would require a significantly longer time., bust the myth, it is important to bust the myth that the entry of fdi will sound a death knell for the ‘self-organised’ or small-format retail trade. currently, the share of modern retail is a mere five per cent in the total retail trade sector. from all estimates, this is expected to, at best, quadruple over the next 20 years. that would still leave a healthy 80 per cent of total retail trade — the volume is expected to rise from current $500 billion to $900 billion — to the self-organised sector. thus 20 years later, ‘mom & pop’ stores will still have a business turnover of more than $650 billion as compared to the current $450 billion. by no stretch of imagination is there going to be an annihilation of the self-organised retail trade sector., the ghost of the east india company has to be finally buried. it is simply inconceivable that modern indian business will not be able to hold its own, either independently or as a joint venture partner, vis-à-vis the foreign investor., as many studies citing empirical evidence and survey-based results have shown, a modernised retail sector will offer significant benefits for farmers, small producers and, of course the consumers. but the most important contribution will be in the generation of a large number of ‘semi-skilled’ or skilled jobs for india’s young population. these jobs are not being generated by the self-organised sector, whose labour practices are not of the highest standards. estimates show that given the high labour intensity of modern large format retail, millions of youth will be trained and new jobs will be created. all those who oppose fdi in retail must pause to think and suggest alternatives in a situation that demands the creation of 10 million new jobs in our economy simply to absorb new entrants to the work force., for the farmer, farmers will benefit in more than one way. the investment in backend infrastructure by modern retailers would reduce wastage and allow greater shelf life for farm products this much needed investment will connect the farm-gate to retail stores, an investment and process that cannot be undertaken by small retailers. this will also minimise the layers of intermediaries as a result of which farmer get much lower prices than they could if they supplied directly to retail stores. moreover, modern retailers will also provide farmers with new high yield varieties of seeds and better technologies that will help bring down the cost and more yields. therefore, the entry of fdi in multi-brand retail is likely to have a significant positive impact on the modernisation of the agricultural sector.",0.1774052600838315,critical necessary

2012-09-22,"a risky strategy, born of panic","as the economy slows down and the rupee wilts, manmohan singh has bitten the ‘reforms’ bullet with both eyes on the credit rating agencies whose negative reports have done much to dampen the ‘animal spirits’ of investors, foreign and native., last november, when the congress party made a push to introduce foreign direct investment in multi-brand retail, protests in parliament forced the government to back off. pranab mukherjee, who was union finance minister at the time, said the fdi plan was being put on hold until a political consensus emerges., i asked a senior member of the prime minister’s cabinet what had changed between november 2011 and september 2012. there is still no consensus on fdi in retail, yet a decision has been taken to go full steam ahead. “what has changed is the value of the rupee,” the minister replied. every rupee that the dollar gains adds rs 8,000 crore to india’s annualised oil import bill. “of course, manmohan admitted to us that not even one dollar may flow into retail or airlines right now”, he said. but this decision to open the sector and raise diesel prices has to be taken in order to stop the rupee from going into free fall., signalling is not an unknown tactic, both in economics and in war. signals can radiate strength and resolve, but they can also connote weakness. how will those whose ‘animal spirits’ are being propitiated look at the petard the upa has just pinned upon the door of small retail across india? dr. singh must not be fooled by the applause he has garnered from editorialists, tv anchors and corporate leaders for being “tough” and “decisive”. these perfumed words may wash the stain of the washington post’s ink on his hands — a recent article in the american paper about his indecisiveness seems to have particularly stung the pmo — but they are self-serving and deceptive. from their vantage point in the white house or on wall street, the champions of american finance and enterprise see an indian prime minister who is not tough but vulnerable: a man who believes the only way he can revive the economy and save the rupee is by doing what it takes to pull in foreign institutional investors and even hot money., there is no doubt that foreign capital inflows, including fii monies, have played a big role in india’s success story over the past decade. but the problem with the manmohan singh strategy today is three-fold. first, it leaves untouched the very structural imbalances in the indian economy that are responsible for the onset of the slowdown and, worse, stagflation. second, by pinning all hopes on the revival of foreign inflows, those imbalances will most likely get exacerbated. today, instead of being used for productive investment, capital is getting locked up in property, gold and other ‘safe’ outlets. a revival of the sensex on the back of renewed fii interest may breathe some life into the stock market. but the risk is that this may trigger speculative demand and have no impact on the real economy. the third problem with the prime minister’s current approach is that the appetite of finance capital will not be sated so easily. one concession must necessarily beget another in order for the foreign investor to keep the faith in the india story., a few weeks ago, we were told that the dilution and postponement of the general anti-avoidance rules (gaar) on tax — an important initiative taken by mr. mukherjee in the last budget — is necessary so as not to scare off investment. the same reason was cited to argue against the ‘mauritius route’ of inbound investment being shut down. today it is said that the bait of fdi in retail must be thrown to the rating agencies, or else the rupee will sink. sure, the rupee has recovered against the dollar by around rs 1.50 in the past few days but what happens if and when these gains get eroded again by structural factors? foreign investors will demand more liberalised norms for entry into banking, insurance and pension funds. they will demand a friendlier patent regime for drugs so that generics can be blocked in the name of “incremental innovation.” they will rail against the ‘wasteful’ subsidies on food and employment going to india’s poor., the slowdown of the indian economy today is essentially due to manufacturing. this, in turn, is largely the product of poor governance and mismanagement by the central and state governments and their systematic neglect of basic infrastructure like roads and power over a long period of time. it is also the product of corruption and rent-seeking. the sub-optimal utilisation of the railways and coastal shipping — under the influence of one private lobby or another — raises the cost of long-haul cargo and increases the inflationary impact of any diesel price hike. thanks to poor monitoring of contractor works, road projects remain unfinished for years on end, even after the land acquisition process is over. industry is plagued by chronic electricity shortages even as would-be power producers find it more profitable to squat on their allocated coal or gas blocks., why is it that the prime minister didn’t think about being tough and decisive when it came to allocating coal blocks through a transparent auction? why weren’t such auctions seen as a way of plugging the fiscal deficit? and we haven’t even begun talking about the allocation of bauxite, iron ore, granite, sand and water. how much revenue is the state continuing to forego by not charging proper prices from the businessmen lucky enough to land concessions for these resources?, the other structural problem the indian economy faces is the mismatch between a national political culture that is democratic and a model of resource allocation that resents dissent. all those who are busy denouncing trinamool congress leader mamata banerjee for her decision to withdraw support to the upa should remember that india is perhaps the only country in the world to have established universal adult franchise and a mature parliamentary system well before it turned to building capitalism in earnest. in virtually every other country, capitalist industrialisation came first and democracy followed, or the two developed side by side. if we are to build ‘capitalism with indian characteristics,’ this requires a reimagining of the economic decision-making process. this means decisions cannot be taken in a peremptory, top-down manner, ignoring the views and concerns of voters and communities whose land, resources and labour industry needs to utilise., at the event to relaunch frontline magazine on thursday, the noted economist, prabhat patnaik, spoke of the social contract of fraternity which lay at the base of the freedom struggle and of the indian state which emerged. springing from this are five universal rights which he said were non-negotiable: the right to food, employment at a living wage, education in good quality neighbourhood schools, healthcare and pension security for the elderly and disabled. none of these rights can be realised by granting concessions and subsidies to the corporate sector.",0.019093088624338627,"risky strategy , born panic","economy slows rupee wilts , manmohan singh bitten ‘reforms ’ bullet eyes credit rating agencies whose negative reports done much dampen ‘animal spirits ’ investors , foreign native. , last november , congress party made push introduce foreign direct investment multi-brand retail , protests parliament forced government back off. pranab mukherjee , union finance minister time , said fdi plan put hold political consensus emerges. , asked senior member prime minister ’ cabinet changed november 2011 september 2012. still consensus fdi retail , yet decision taken go full steam ahead. “what changed value rupee , ” minister replied. every rupee dollar gains adds rs 8,000 crore india ’ annualised oil import bill. “of course , manmohan admitted us even one dollar may flow retail airlines right ” , said. decision open sector raise diesel prices taken order stop rupee going free fall. , signalling unknown tactic , economics war. signals radiate strength resolve , also connote weakness. whose ‘animal spirits ’ propitiated look petard upa pinned upon door small retail across india ?

2012-09-26,if you can’t beat this government …,"the common-sense view of politics is that it is farcical. sometimes absurdly so, as was seen last week. the rush of fast-paced, oversized images that television relentlessly beamed as mamata banerjee walked out of the united progressive alliance (upa)-ii suggested an overwhelming, shattering climax that just did not happen., ms banerjee’s surprise revolt over the new economic announcements — foreign direct investment (fdi) in multibrand retail, diesel price hike and the cap on supply of lpg cylinders — was potentially catastrophic for the manmohan singh government. yet a week after the west bengal chief minister reduced the ruling alliance to a numerical minority, it is the latter that is defiantly triumphant. team manmohan hasn’t keeled over in fright. it has drawn itself up to its full height, hero-like swagger and all, while the opposition appears at sixes and sevens., to be sure, there have been several mock mutinies. the left and the samajwadi party (sp) called a bandh against the economic initiatives, which affected normal life in some parts. the bharatiya janata party (bjp) too bestirred itself to speak against the reforms. nitin gadkari and sitaram yechury held hands while mulayam singh hit the streets with the party’s followers. the sp chief fairly bristled: he called the congress anti-poor, swore to fight it till eternity, spoke of a third front, hinted at running for prime minister and occupied a tantalising cliffhanger on supporting a mamata-sponsored future parliamentary resolution against fdi in retail. but the postscript was predictable: he would back the government in order to safeguard the nation from “communal forces.”, now consider this twist. the sp may have heroically rescued the government from the bjp but the bjp itself looks nowhere near wanting to unseat manmohan & co. a day before trinamool congress-upa relations irretrievably broke down, mr. gadkari was at a press conference where his only concern seemed to be the safety of the government. the bjp chief’s answer to every question was that his party would do nothing to destabilise the government. “no, we will not move a no-confidence motion. it is not our job to topple the government,” and so forth. the painful protestations forced some in the nonplussed audience to shout back: “of course, toppling is your job!” how did the bjp, with a consistent track record of unruly behaviour, come suddenly to affect such saintly qualities? this was the party that had boisterously shut down parliament over coalgate and vowed not to rest until it had secured the prime minister’s resignation for his role in “the biggest scam in independent india.” what would happen to the bjp’s plans to storm the country with its “village to metro” anti-coalgate protests if mr. gadkari was simultaneously going to be at the service of the government?, left’s presence, no one can dispute the left parties’ genuine opposition to economic reforms, and undoubtedly theirs was the most legitimate presence at the bandh. it is their core philosophy, their bread and butter. even so, the left parties are clearly wary of taking their protest to the next level which can logically only be the ouster of the government. the dilemma was evident in the way the cpi(m)’s prakash karat framed his opposition. he said the government would lose its right to continue if it didn’t roll back the new measures. surely, the government, however unforgivable its failings, will not itself exit to oblige the opposition., the indian opposition situation recalls the republican party’s frustrations vis-à-vis president barack obama. venting her anger at presidential nominee mitt romney, conservative talk show host laura ingraham said recently: “if you can’t beat barack obama with this record, then shut down the party. shut it down.”, there cannot be two views on the record of the upa-ii regime. indeed, there comes a moment in every government’s life when nothing it does can redeem it in the popular imagination. rajiv gandhi’s government lost its innocence after the bofors allegations. the fate of the narasimha rao ministry was sealed after the babri masjid breathed its last and the atal bihari vajpayee government could never live down the 2002 gujarat anti-muslim pogrom., manmohan singh’s second term had reached that critical point with 18 months still left for the general election. after 2g, the commonwealth games and coalgate, the stoutest defence could not save the government from being seen as corrupt, inefficient and unconscionably indifferent to the plight of the aam aadmi in whose name the congress and its allies had won two consecutive elections. it didn’t matter whether the government’s guilt was actually established in these scams. it didn’t matter that the best and brightest ministers furiously disputed the zeros added to the loot figure. it didn’t matter because, as one senior minister unhappily admitted, the government had lost the perception game., from 2010 to 2012, worse, the government had lost its grip on the economy and the once blameless prime minister was under critical domestic and international scrutiny. in the worst of times, dr. singh had two fallbacks. the indian economy, which seemed miraculously insulated from global recessionary trends. and his own glowing image. as a former media adviser to dr. singh once said, he was “the most honest pm leading the most dishonest government.” in 2010, the british daily, the independent, described dr. singh as “one of the world’s most revered leaders,” one who had “transformed a nation of 1.2 billion people.” the same year, newsweek adjudged him leader of leaders, “the leader other leaders love,” and forbes paid the highest possible tribute, saying he had been “universally praised as india’s best pm since nehru.”, cut to mid-2012. the indian press was asking probing questions about the helmsman’s personal honesty while the foreign media seemed to have given him up as a lost cause. it was against this background that the government, in an almost last-ditch effort, unleashed an audacious package of reforms aimed at national and international investors. obviously the non-upa parties were going to see this as an affront. yet they were helpless in the face of the upa numbers. so when the trinamool congress, a ruling ally, struck the first blow, they were provided the perfect setting for some collective non-upa action. this was their adrenaline-rush moment: the government that could do no right was on the verge of collapse and the decision whether it stayed or went was in their hands. but the moment passed with critical players yo-yoing over what to do next., so why did the sp not go the whole hog? why is the bjp being uncharacteristically coy? after all, these are two parties that at least theoretically stand to benefit from the government’s exit and early elections. mulayam singh’s problem is twofold. he can only act if he is sure of being able to control the fallout of his action. if he withdrew support, and the government managed to survive, he would be worse off than before, possibly losing the central assistance required to shore up the cash-strapped akhilesh yadav government. today’s reality is that political parties need resources to fight elections which can only come from mega projects. second, the sp chief’s aim is to lead the third front whose barest outlines are not visible at the moment., a better strategy for him is to keep the government in a frustrating state of tension, extract all the concessions he can, and bide for the right time. this explains his deliberately provocative back and forth statements.",0.05377490443279916,’ beat government …,"common-sense view politics farcical. sometimes absurdly , seen last week. rush fast-paced , oversized images television relentlessly beamed mamata banerjee walked united progressive alliance ( upa ) -ii suggested overwhelming , shattering climax happen. , ms banerjee ’ surprise revolt new economic announcements — foreign direct investment ( fdi ) multibrand retail , diesel price hike cap supply lpg cylinders — potentially catastrophic manmohan singh government. yet week west bengal chief minister reduced ruling alliance numerical minority , latter defiantly triumphant. team manmohan ’ keeled fright. drawn full height , hero-like swagger , opposition appears sixes sevens. , sure , several mock mutinies. left samajwadi party ( sp ) called bandh economic initiatives , affected normal life parts. bharatiya janata party ( bjp ) bestirred speak reforms. nitin gadkari sitaram yechury held hands mulayam singh hit streets party ’ followers. sp chief fairly bristled : called congress anti-poor , swore fight till eternity , spoke third front , hinted running prime minister occupied tantalising cliffhanger supporting mamata-sponsored future parliamentary resolution fdi retail. postscript predictable : would back government order safeguard nation “communal forces. ” , consider twist. sp may heroically rescued government bjp bjp looks nowhere near wanting unseat manmohan &amp; co. day trinamool congress-upa relations irretrievably broke , mr. gadkari press conference concern seemed safety government. bjp chief ’ answer every question party would nothing destabilise government. “no , move no-confidence motion. job topple government , ” forth. painful protestations forced nonplussed audience shout back : “of course , toppling job ! ” bjp , consistent track record unruly behaviour , come suddenly affect saintly qualities ?

2012-09-27,india shouldn’t look like the weakest bric in the wall,"chief economic adviser raghuram rajan took over at a time when there was a change in the finance ministry at the top with mr. p. chidambaram returning to north block. the upa government has now switched to “reforms” mode. in conversation with ashok dasgupta, dr. rajan explained some of the measures that have been initiated. excerpts:, dr. rajan, you took over as chief economic adviser almost along with mr. p. chidambaram returning as finance minister. were you not surprised by the change in the government’s policy stance?, well, i don’t think any of the steps the government has taken were not steps that were being debated. i think the need to increase fuel prices was clear. fdi at various fronts was clearly something the government had tried before. i think the public surprise has been that the government went so far in putting all these things together and, of course, i presume the answer, the reason is the political equation changed somewhat so that the government saw space for it and knew it had to be done. i am not privy to what particular equation changed; all i can say is i think the set of reforms has been good., but from a state of inertia, the sudden push to reforms…, i would say more generally, one of the things in a democracy is that difficult times create this space for reforms. you can see that again and again in the european union in the euro area. when times get tough, somehow they find the political space to do more and they surprise the markets. i think the people who think that democracies go in a straight line and the paralysis of stagnation is permanent ignore the fact that ultimately, politicians have to respond to the people, to the electorate and sometimes space is created. so that is the general academics of equation but what specifically changed this time i can’t guess. i think there is no secret that mr. chidambaram is a finance minister who certainly made some changes and also pushed hard but there are other factors also at play., did the threat of downgrading the sovereign rating play a role?, i am not sure how much that necessarily played a part. clearly nobody wants the rating down and we need to do our best to stay investment grade because there are some ramifications to downgrading. but i think the moves are not taken primarily with that in mind. i mean they are necessary for the logic of the economy to get out of a situation where deficit spirals create problems for your external front because when you have large external debt we have to borrow money. for every subsided rupee you have spent, you have to borrow it from outside. that is not a pleasant situation. then, of course, there is an effect of inflation, of higher government deficit, for more demand and eventually over the long run, higher inflation. we just had a presentation and there is a general sense that the high subsidy can’t go on. anything that is unsustainable will stop., is it safe to assume that minority governments are faster on reforms?, i don’t think you need to draw that equation. i mean indian history with the narasimha rao government might suggest that. but at the same time you can see episodes where minority governments were not particularly functional either. so i don’t think you need to draw that conclusion. what i do think is that the current team in the finance ministry as well as the pmo are very eager to continue this process so as to bring back the rates of growth., the debate over investment through fdi and fii inflow. right now it is fii inflow…, i think what we need to do is to establish the fact that we are a healthy economy so that we are seen more as a haven rather than something to run from. so we need to have better policies; if we look like a good emerging market rather than the weakest bric nation, i think we will benefit. so you know every country has its problems. brazil has problems with credit. chinese growth has been coming down. and there are concerns that the investment model they had is problematic. so in this environment what is it that we can do enough to look different; to look attractive? every investor is looking for high rates of growth. if we show that we are creating a pathway to that, then maybe some of the fii hot money will actually become cold money. that should be an objective and of course in the longer run it has to be substantiated by fdi flow and adequate reserve., you also talked about inflation, people seem to be getting richer and consuming more…",0.1123974867724868,india ’ look like weakest bric wall,"chief economic adviser raghuram rajan took time change finance ministry top mr. p. chidambaram returning north block. upa government switched “reforms ” mode. conversation ashok dasgupta , dr. rajan explained measures initiated. excerpts : , dr. rajan , took chief economic adviser almost along mr. p. chidambaram returning finance minister. surprised change government ’ policy stance?

2012-09-28,"money does grow on trees, prime minister","there is no way we can take lightly the prime minister’s recent address to the nation. it was, unarguably, an exceptional step for him to take, renowned as he is neither for his loquacity, nor for his oratorial skills. why then did he mount his rocinante of ‘91 vintage and futilely lance opponents of his policies by alleging that they were “spreading canards”? also, which sancho panza on his staff persuaded him to use this insulting noun? but for this, his otherwise rather nondescript address would have been best left to its inevitable fate of oblivion. not, however, now., telephone call, first: this rather admonitory “money does not grow on trees”. just a day after this astonishing, also so unneeded, reprimand, i received a telephone call from a retired soldier colleague, who had served with me as my tank driver, sharing with me for many years my tank lean-to shelter at night. i save his name lest he be nagged by the otherwise inefficient intelligence bureau. “sahib”, he said in his thick shekhawati dialect and accent, “please educate the pm that money does actually grow on trees and plants; we get all our fruits, vegetables and animal feed and also firewood from a ‘tree’. so tell him to think of the farmers, not of the ‘foreigners’, who over two centuries back came as a company and took away our land. not one ‘biswa’ a measure of land was left to us”. i promised him i would do so, but advised him not to disturb his retired life over such depressing thoughts, for just as our ‘dhabas’ defeated a rather cocky colonel from kentucky, us of a, india will defeat this, too. and not one word of this anecdote is made up., therefore, next to the fabled merits of multiple retail shops of (in)famous names., please reflect first on the merits of india’s unorganised and widely dispersed retail trade, explained with admirable clarity and succinctness by s. gurumurthy (“‘reform’ at nation’s cost,” new indian express, september 20) : “the unorganised retail trade in india represents the traditional, community-centric, low-cost … employment intense retailing that includes, but is not limited to, kirana shops, owner-run-general stores, paan-beedi shops, convenience stores, and hand-cart and pavement vending. in this model a whole family works in one shop and a whole community is engaged in the trade in a defined area. most advocates of corporate … and retail firms … ignore this critical contribution of the existing system to the indian economy and society (emphasis added). this “multi-layer retailing is the most decentralised economic activity in india after agriculture. second, it constitutes almost 98 percent of the total trade with an estimated 12 million outlets. in contrast, organised trade accounts for just 2 percent. third, it is the largest employment provider after agriculture, employing an estimated 40 million people”. in contrast, the world’s largest retail chain, wal-mart, employs just about five lakhs. fourth, being “self-employed … with their families”, this activity comprises “120 million people”., it is “retailing that continuously generates … huge community-based entrepreneurship”. and then “it contributes over 14 percent of india’s gdp, while all the companies in the bse 500 index, put together is some 4 percent”. also that the “unorganised retail segment has been growing at an average rate of over 8 percent a year for the last eight years (1999-00 to 2006-07). … second only to construction …” let us consider seriously that “if this social capital link to retail trade is unsettled, the entire distant and remote supply chain will suffer over a period, disturbing the social equilibrium and the organic social links that have evolved over … centuries”., there is then a further ‘canard’ spread by our dear pm and his ilk, suggesting that concerns like ‘walmart’, and others of that variety, overflow with the milk of human kindness and act only out of empathy and compassion for india’s farmers and poor. gurumurthy very effectively comes to our assistance here, too, the evidence, even in the u.s. being to the contrary: “walmart

they have seen me on youtube so they know what to expect of me,” he says confidently. , equally, he is sure that he’ll be at home in the league which is known for its “chilled out possession game”. it’ll favour him more than the physical style of kansas city wizards, now called sporting kansas city, where he played during the 2010-2011 season. diagramming the physicality, chhetri sends his fist crashing into his outstretched palm., back to the game, with the transfer, chhetri is also hopeful of returning to the fifa video game series after a year-long absence. his image rights have been purchased by sporting lisbon, and he is confident of a better valuation than when he was contracted to kansas city wizards. “they gave me 63 the last time,” he remembers, almost wistfully., when he was unveiled as a sporting player earlier this year, chhetri was euphoric. he spoke of his transfer as a move from playing in and for a country that is ranked 165th in the world to playing in a country ranked fifth in the world. india has since sunk four more places in the rankings, while portugal has moved up one place., country and club usually constitute separate identities for a footballer, with the latter being the more durable one. but for chhetri, country spills into club. “the saddest question i am asked is whether indians can play football. yet you have to answer it.” so alongside having to establish himself anew as a footballer, he will have to prove that india is a footballing nation., chhetri isn’t bogged down by the burden of proof, however. he has a precedent in hidetoshi nakata. one of the first japanese footballers to play in europe, nakata’s signing by serie a club perugia coincided with japan’s first ever appearance in the fifa world cup in its 1998 edition. japan has since featured in all three world cups. many have followed nakata to the shores of europe, including the likes of nagatomo, uchida, keisuke honda, shinji kagawa and, most recently, ryo miyaichi. footballing reasons converged with business imperatives in these signings, as european clubs looked to breach new markets abroad., bright forecast, a similar phenomenon, which might in the interest of context be termed ‘fdi in football’, is beginning to emerge in india. there is talk of india possibly hosting the next under-17 football world cup, sporting has outlined its vision for the development of football here and manchester united plans to tour the country soon. chhetri’s forecasts for indian football are also quite bright. “under bob (houghton), we managed to put a string of good performances together. and the nehru cup win under (wim) koevermans against an opponent (cameroon) ranked more than 100 places ahead of us shows our potential.”",0.1815219502719503,‘there nobody ’,"sunil chhetri : let ' play ball. photo : s. subramanium &#124;

2012-10-02,let’s not overrate foreign investment,"with the intention of signalling a strong commitment to reforms, the upa government has announced a hike in the price of diesel and liberalisation of foreign direct investment (fdi) in multi-brand retail, justifying the measures as growth-enhancing and inflation-dampening. they have been termed bold by india’s corporate sector and burdensome by an opposition united across the ideological spectrum. in his speech to the nation on september 20, the prime minister stated that the government’s move is motivated by concern for the ordinary indian. given the conflicting responses, there is room here for analysis., strengthen infrastructure, the interesting thing about public sector pricing, in this case of diesel, is that keeping prices steady as input costs rise would be as political in content as raising them is. as stated in an editorial in this newspaper some days ago, the government need not have waited so long to raise the price. it would seem that the government had no intention of doing so while parliament was in session. be that as it may, there is a strong case for eliminating the subsidy on all fossil fuels and transferring the saving thus made into public infrastructure. apart from the symbolism of soaking the suv-driving rich, the building and maintenance of public infrastructure are more likely to help the poor — presumably the pm’s aam aadmi — than the current regime of subsidies., the creation of infrastructure employs the poor directly as it is they who build it. secondly, the provision of the producer services afforded by the infrastructure sustains private economic activity which generates employment. the idea that the poor would benefit more from public investment than the present subsidy regime, described by some as welfare state for the rich, has not really been sufficiently debated. for india’s political class, subsidies are the easiest path to being seen as benefactors while being relieved of the task of managing the process of building and maintaining infrastructure, arguably a non-negotiable aspect of governance in a democracy. so, even a small hike in the price of diesel can be the beginning of a realignment of government expenditure from consumption subsidies to investment in infrastructure, and the poor may be expected to gain from this. finally, the gains from macroeconomic stability cannot be legitimately ignored when evaluating the prospects for the poor. macroeconomic instability spares nobody, and india’s current account deficit by now exceeds the figure for 1991. fuel subsidies have enormous consequences for the balance of payments, as 80 per cent of our oil consumption is imported., when it comes to fdi in retail, the beneficial impact on the aam aadmi is altogether less obvious than in the case of lowering the diesel subsidy. what fdi in this sector may be expected to do is to take the shopping experience in india to the next level. surely, cavernous supermarkets make it easier to shop for those with deeper pockets. precisely because the supplier caters to this cohort the quality of the groceries may be expected to rise. in fact, we have already seen this happening, even without fdi, with organised retail spreading in india. but those on a daily wage and no ready cash are unlikely to patronise these suburban behemoths. they may be expected to prop up the kirana with its infinite capacity for apportioning their stuff to suit the customer’s purse and willingness to extend her credit. so the opposition may well be crying wolf over the imminent disappearance of the corner store., but the government’s claim of a ‘win-win’ with higher prices for farmers and lower prices for customers with the advent of fdi may be somewhat exaggerated. for precisely because the large retailer must cut through the supply chain to deliver this outcome, there would be some displacement in the middle. the government counters this reasoning by pointing to investment at the backend, in cold storage and such. this is possible of course, but we would want to wait and see the full combined effect once all effects have worked their way through the economy. some part of the corner-store complex will survive purely because there are too many poor people in this country yet, generating a substantial demand for low quality food with lower mark-ups. but the position that a policy is only as good as its direct impact on employment is surely untenable. to reject outright a move on the grounds that it does not directly put the poor to work would be folly. productivity growth is often first employment displacing but it also lowers prices and raises demand. the point is that it not only raises demand for the good in question but for all other goods in the economy, as real income is higher following the rise in productivity. overall employment in the economy may be expected to expand., little to offer, it is when it comes to inflation though that the present round of announcements by the government has little or nothing to offer. the suggestion, first made when the proposal was mooted some months ago, that fdi in retail would dampen inflation is difficult to fathom. the source of the current inflation is a veritable excess demand for vegetables and a manufactured excess demand for the principal foodgrains. the latter stems from the government’s procurement and storage policy. by mopping up almost the entire marketed surplus of grain as it comes into the wholesale markets and then allowing it to rot by unaccountable stock management, the government of india abets hunger in the name of supporting the farmer. the entire political class is united in not calling attention to this travesty.",0.02558229813664597,let ’

singh ahluwalia and deepak parekh, chairman, high level committee on financing of infrastructure during an interaction with media in new delhi on wednesday. photo rajeev bhatt , suggesting big-ticket reforms to attract investment in the infrastructure sector, a high-level committee, on wednesday, recommended increasing electricity charges and rail fares., the high-level committee on financing of infrastructure, which is headed by hdfc chairman deepak parekh, also pitched for 100 per cent foreign direct investment (fdi) in the telecom sector. the limit at present is 74 per cent., the panel also suggested raising prices of natural gas., these recommendations are aimed at attracting rs.51.46 lakh crore for funding the infrastructure sector during the xii plan (2012-17), according to the report, which was presented to prime minister manmohan singh earlier in the day., the government, the report says, should draw “a time-bound action plan...with a view to improving the enabling environment for private investment, which is expected to finance about 47 per cent of the projected investment during the xii plan.’’, the share of private sector in infrastructure funding was 37.53 per cent during the xi plan, the report says, adding that the contribution of public sector is estimated to decline to 53.32 per cent during the xii plan from 62.47 per cent in the previous plan., suggesting a slew of reforms in various sectors, including rail, power, coal, gas supply and telecom highways, the report says that the projected investment of about rs.51 lakh crore during the xii plan should not be taken for granted., “...it is likely to fall short significantly if a number of measures necessary for removing policy and implementation impediments are not taken within a short time-frame,” it said., sustainable pricing of commodities and services, especially energy, would be necessary, it says, while underlining the need for promoting the public-private partnership (ppp) model of development for projects in sectors such as rail, ports, airports and highways., in order to maintain flow of investment in the power sector, the report says, “tariffs will have to be set at sustainable levels, while also improving the collection efficiency and reducing losses.’’ the report further says that the increase in fuel cost should be passed on to the consumers to prevent piling up of losses of the power distribution companies., the committee has suggested rationalisation of gas allocations and pricing policy within the next two months as further delay would impact the viability of gas-based power stations., with regard to rail fares, the report calls for “rationalisation of the prevailing uneconomic rail fares, which have not been revised for a decade”., it has suggested greater involvement of private sector in rail projects and revamping of the railway board on commercial lines., as far as the telecom sector is concerned, the committee has made a strong case for raising the fdi cap to 100 per cent from 74 per cent now, arguing that it may be difficult for indian partners to provide 26 per cent capital to companies seeking pan-india presence., the committee has suggested that the progress of projects and award of contracts in the infrastructure sector should be monitored on a monthly basis by the cabinet committee on infrastructure (cci)., elaborating on the need for power sector reforms, the committee has suggested that the government should operationalise the open access system to introduce competition., “this will not only introduce competition, but (will) also help in attracting the much needed private investment in power generation as producers will be able to sell directly to bulk consumers in a competitive market as against the present reliance on financially unviable discoms,” the report adds., with regard to highways, the committee suggested that the national highways authority of india should draw a month-wise plan to award contract for 10,000 km during 2012-13., the government, it adds, should expeditiously set up the long-awaited express authority of india, and ensure that engineering procurement and construction projects for 5,000 km are awarded in the current fiscal., with regard kolkata and chennai airports, which are being constructed by the airports authority of india (aai), the committee says, “the operation and management of these airports, including the airside and city side facilities, may be undertaken through ppp...”, in the case of telecom sector, the report underlines the need for

2012-10-07,playing brinksmanship to promote infrastructure,"the upa-ii government’s decision to move ahead with a set of 20-odd measures, some of them quite contentious, is a political gamble, even while it seeks to reinforce the ‘reformist’ tag. arguably, the most eye-catching of the announcements, which finance minister p. chidambaram made on thursday last, have to do with the insurance and pensions sectors. the hike in the foreign direct investment (fdi) limit in the insurance sector to 49 per cent from the present 26 per cent, with a proviso that the pension sector can also receive foreign money to the same extent, are two measures that promise to be the most contentious., unlike the previous ‘big bang’ reforms such as throwing open multi-brand retail trade to fdi, which do not require legislative approval, the enhancement of fdi in the insurance sectors needs parliamentary clearance. even in these early days after the announcements, there is plenty of speculation as to how the upa government will get these amendments passed, especially as it lacks a majority in the rajya sabha., a logical question is why should the government risk so much in pushing for fdi in the insurance and pension sectors. these proposals are not new. in fact, they have been debated at the parliamentary standing committee. however, the cap on fdi as agreed to was 26 per cent in the pensions sector on a par with what obtains in the insurance sector. that, however, was of academic value. in the absence of a statutory regulator, pension reform was a virtual non-starter. the question of investment by private, including foreign players, did not arise., interestingly, the pension fund regulatory and development authority (pfrda) bill, first mooted seven years ago by the then nda government, was also cleared by the government for parliamentary approval. it is hoped that its eventual passage should not be as difficult as raising of the fdi limits. however, it must be emphasised that as recently as november, 2011, the government failed to get the crucial opposition support over a relatively technical issue: whether to specify the fdi cap (of 26 per cent) in the pfrda act itself or in the rules to be framed after the enactment. the bjp wanted it to be built into the act while the government wanted it to be notified under rules as it would get flexibility to vary the cap if needed., the political atmosphere has become vitiated since november, and it is doubtful whether even the degree of consensus, which was obtained 11 months ago, would be valid today., the more important point is that disagreement over the size of the fdi cap may overshadow the moves to empower the pfrda. hopefully, that should be a blessing. with a statutory status, the pension regulator can preside over the orderly opening up of the sector, which, today, has been unable to deliver even the minimum that is called for, and has left large sections uncovered. according to reliable estimates, only a very small percentage of india’s workforce, of roughly 420 million, are covered under some formal pension scheme or the other. the main reason is that the government simply does not have the money to expand the scheme or even keep it afloat. increasing longevity and the break-up of the joint family system have brought to the fore the serious chinks in india’s social security armour. the fiscal implications to the government of shifting from defined benefit under the old system to defined contribution, which is the characteristic of the new order, are enormous. they explain why not just in india but in many other countries guaranteed pension for their employees has left a gaping hole in their public finances.",0.008552846524544636,playing brinksmanship

2012-10-21,no easy ride for foreign retailers,"the central government’s decision to allow 51 per cent foreign direct investment (fdi) in multi-brand retail is likely to stimulate investments in the organised retail industry. if all the big states implement the decision (at present, only nine states and two union territories have agreed to open up multi-brand retail to fdi), we estimate $2.5-3 billion will flow in the form of fdi of the total expected investments of $10 billion in the retail industry over the next five years,, bulk of the fdi in retail is likely to flow into the food and grocery (f&g) vertical as organised retail penetration (orp) in this vertical is the lowest. the f&g segment, which stands at $300 billion, accounts for two-thirds of the indian retail market but has organised retail sales of only around 2 per cent. this highly price-sensitive segment will gain the most from the scale, technology and investments in the back-end that would accompany fdi in retail., according to the fdi policy norms, the minimum investment by a foreign retailer should be $100 million, and 50 per cent of this amount has to be channelled into the development of back-end infrastructure in the first three years. this minimum investment can typically fund the establishment of around one million sq. ft. of front-end store space, equivalent to 10-15 hypermarkets or department stores. we do not see this clause as a hurdle as we expect foreign retailers, who intend to achieve scale and efficiency of operations, to invest significantly larger amounts., back-end infrastructure would include investment made processing, manufacturing, distribution, design improvement, quality control, packaging, logistics, storage, warehouse, and agriculture produce infrastructure. this clause will ensure adequate capital expenditure in the back-end supply chain, and help significantly reduce wastages in fruits and vegetables. an efficient supply chain will enable direct sourcing of fruits and vegetables, which will boost farmer realisations by 10-15 per cent; and still bring down retail prices by 15-20 per cent., in 2011-12, organised retail penetration was just 7 per cent of the $430 billion domestic retail industry, the remainder being held by small, unorganised retailers (mom and pop stores). without fdi in multi-brand retail, we believe orp will increase to 9 per cent in 2016-17;

2012-10-22,how the world works,"active learners: your approach to learning can change your attitude. photo: k. murali kumar | photo credit: k_murali kumar , “education must be practical and prepare students for the working world”, “students must be active learners - not passive recipients of knowledge”, while most educationists and students would agree with the statements above, there is a wide gap between what happens in reality., ask anyone what subjects are taught in a typical school and most people will be able to say maths, physics, biology etc. this is the “world of subjects” — the one students are familiar with the most. the bad news is that once you leave school (or college for that matter), the world of subjects ceases to exist. few ask if you are an expert in physics or in biology (unless you are in the academic field) anymore., what people do ask is if you are an expert in an area within the world of work, for example in architecture; in medicine; in law; in acting and so forth., why should understanding the world of work be a necessity? there are two reasons for that. first, deciding on what we want to do in our careers requires us to understand the working world. we hear many students say “i want to become a banker” without knowing what the world of finance is or “i want to become a software engineer” without understanding what information technology is. if you do not know about, say, the “energy & natural resources” sector, how can you even consider careers within that which may be perfectly suited for you?, opportunity, another detailed example: what comes to mind when you think about the health science area? most people think of doctors and nurses, but there are so many more opportunities. there is the field of “medical devices” where companies are now building low cost portable devices for india; there is “health insurance” where increased fdi is being proposed; the massive “pharmaceutical industry” which develops and sells lifesaving drugs and “provider services”– providing medical care that is now extending into medical tourism in india., each of these areas in the health science field offers a unique opportunity to students of science, commerce and the humanities., indeed, it does not matter which subject group students have taken – even a commerce graduate can work in the health care field. now imagine the opportunities available when you understand the entire world of work!, the second benefit is more intangible. understanding the working world makes youngsters more confident. we hear people often say that after understanding the working world, they are far more outgoing, bolder and are able to ask a lot more pertinent questions when they meet people from different walks of life., different sectors, so how do we learn about this fascinating world of work? well, similar to the different academic subjects, we have different “sectors” that comprise the world of work. for instance, agriculture is a sector; architecture, health science, law & order, information technology are some of the others. the exciting part about learning about these sectors is that the learning can be applied to the real world immediately. students learn to link what they learn in the classroom to the sectors, thus understanding how academic knowledge can be applied",0.194,world works,"active learners : approach learning change attitude. photo : k. murali kumar &#124; photo credit : k_murali kumar , “education must practical prepare students working world ” , “students must active learners - passive recipients knowledge ” , educationists students would agree statements , wide gap happens reality. , ask anyone subjects taught typical school people able say maths , physics , biology etc. “world subjects ” — one students familiar most. bad news leave school ( college matter ) , world subjects ceases exist. ask expert physics biology ( unless academic field ) anymore. , people ask expert area within world work , example architecture ; medicine ; law ; acting forth. , understanding world work necessity ?

paul noronha | photo credit: paul noronha , the reserve bank of india (rbi) will unveil its second quarter review of credit policy on october 30. being one of the seven reviews of the annual statement, the forthcoming one would be expected to be an exercise in continuity. in a span of just 45 days or so, between two policy statements, the underlying conditions do not normally change very drastically., earlier, the rbi released the mid-quarter policy review on september 17. the first quarter review was on july 31. the annual policy for the year (2012-13) was announced on april 17., despite their frequency, the policy reviews never fail to excite market watchers. it is true that like so often in the recent past the forthcoming review will take place against a backdrop of sluggish economic growth and persistently high inflation. the monetary policy’s traditional dilemma of whether to cut rates to reverse the faltering growth trend or maintain the status quo in the face of continuing price pressures remains the same., except that there are, this time, more than the usual customary hints to the rbi from the new finance minister to drop interest rates. the pressure on the central bank is by no means subtle. in holding the tight monetary policy as being the prime obstacle to growth revival, the government is siding with the several chambers of commerce and industry organisations which have been consistently espousing the cause of a softer interest rate policy. never mind that the rbi has equally consistently resisted such pressures, arguing that inflation is a far greater worry than the economic slowdown., nobody can fault the rbi for following an opaque policy. its interest rate stance was revealed right at the beginning of the year when in the annual policy statement it brought down the repo rate by a larger than expected margin of 50 basis points (0.50 percentage points) but simultaneously stated that markets should not expect further cuts in the near future., yet, pressure from the government was always there, though not perhaps so explicitly as it is now. the government can now claim that it has done its bit to support the rbi in its battle against inflation. it has been the central bank’s frequent and well justified refrain that the loose fiscal policy has been aggravating inflationary pressures. the hike in diesel prices, the opening of retail trade to foreign investors, raising the cap on foreign direct investment (fdi) in insurance and pension sectors to 49 per cent are meant to project the government’s reformist zeal, having an important consequence of indirectly combating inflation., of course, the contrary view is that some of these measures will take a long time to fructify. second, the diesel price hike has already had an adverse impact on inflation, while in the long-run it might help in better managing inflation expectations., what are the hard facts on which the rbi will base its decision — to lower interest rates and /or the crr (cash reserve ratio) or maintain the status quo?, the recent positive news on industrial growth needs to be sustained in subsequent months before anyone can proclaim a revival. inflation remains a big worry, with wholesale inflation rising to 7.8 per cent in september. all segments of the wpi index have come under pressure., inflation expectations have increased. the limited increase in diesel prices might be just the beginning of further increases in controlled as well as non-controlled items. whatever benchmarks the rbi has been relying upon — core inflation, food inflation or retail inflation — there is hardly any scope for optimism.",0.03902152411080983,traditional dilemma central banker,"24/01/2012 mumbai : entrance reserve bank india ( rbi ) building mumbai third quarter review monetary policy 2011-12 - january 24 , 2012 mumbai. photo ;

2012-11-03,garbage as our alter ego,"“that's the whole meaning of life ... trying to find a place for your stuff” — george carlin, the iconic american comedian, and that brilliant dissector of the human condition, george carlin, had in a 1986 sketch about “the stuff” shown us how our tendency to acquire more and more stuff — material commodities — generates great anxieties about how and where to store them. even your house is not a home, but “a place to keep your stuff while you go out and get more stuff.” what carlin did not tell us, at least in this sketch, is that much of the stuff does not find a place, it ends up as garbage: as waste, trash and refuse., if there is one thing that is symptomatic of the modern human condition, but hardly recognised as such, it is garbage. garbage is capitalism’s dark underbelly, its pathological alter ego. that is why we keep disavowing it, refusing to believe it exists., vilappilsala standoff, but the more we deny it, it rears its ugly head, as most recently, in vilappilsala panchayat in kerala where the standoff between the local people, who are opposed to the reopening of a waste treatment plant, and the state has left 2 lakh tonnes of solid waste lying unprocessed, threatening an environmental disaster., it is, therefore, remarkable that the current boisterous debate on foreign direct investment in multi-brand retail in india has completely ignored the question of garbage. by focusing only on the supposed virtues of waste reduction in perishable goods (like fruits and vegetables) brought about by the better storage facilities of retail conglomerates, the issue of the latter’s humongous ecological footprint (for example, in terms of sprawl, increase in driving, and the proliferation of non-biodegradable waste) has been bypassed., according to a report from the institute for local self-reliance, washington, d. c., in the 20-year period from 1990, the same period in which walmart grew to be a behemoth, the average number of miles that a u.s. household travelled for shopping increased by around 1000. and from 2005 to 2010, despite walmart’s initiation of a reduced waste programme, its reported greenhouse gas emissions shot up by 14 per cent., big-box stores don’t just improve efficiency in consumption, they also increase consumption manifold, which ultimately results in phenomenal amounts of trash. the garbage generated by americans annually reportedly amounts to 220 million tonnes, and 80 per cent of u.s. goods are used only once before being trashed., in the mythologies of modernisation and development, we sing paeans to skyscrapers and nuclear plants. but there is no accompanying dirge about the costs we have had to pay for them. if there was, then we would have heard of puente hills — the largest active landfill/waste dump in the united states, which is a 1,365-acre monstrosity — as much as we have about the world trade center or the empire state building., it is ironical, edward humes tells us in his book garbology: our dirty love affair with trash, to call puente hills a “landfill,” for the garbage mountain has long ceased to fill a depression in the land and rises now an unbelievable 500 feet above the ground, a space capable of holding 15 million elephants. it takes, of course, a gargantuan effort, as humes describes, to keep the toxic substance that leaks out of the 130-million tonne waste (which includes 3 million tonnes of soiled disposable diapers — another “important” invention of modern life) from poisoning groundwater sources., nevertheless, waste is seen, in popular development discourse as a “third world” problem, the ubiquitous mountains of garbage that blight the face of cities and towns in the poorer parts of the world — one of the first tasks that the newly-elected president in egypt had was cleaning up the garbage mess in cairo. and the citizens of the third world have internalised this discourse, seeing themselves as part of the “dirty” developing world blissfully unaware of the cost at which a “clean” developed world is maintained. thus the story of the somali pirates plundering the high seas has become a part of global lore but not that of somalia being a (cheap) dumping ground for some of the most toxic garbage, including nuclear and medical waste, from europe for the last two decades and more. as long as the streets are clean in frankfurt and paris, does it matter that children are born in somalia without limbs?, ‘waste imperialism’, it is in this context of “waste imperialism” that the question of garbage needs to come out of its subterranean existence and occupy centre stage in any discussion on development, including fdi in retail. it is not accidental that dumping grounds, and waste treatment plants are invariably located in places where the most vulnerable and marginalised sections of the population live, whether in the developed or developing worlds. not surprisingly, garbage has become an important political tool in the present with garbage strikes and struggles around garbage taking place in various cities in the west and elsewhere. the contestation in vilappilsala has been going on since 2000 when the waste treatment plant opened with serious ecological impact., we would be living in a mythical world if we think that the problems of waste can be solved only with better rational planning, management or recycling. in the u.s., even after decades of environmental education, only around 24 per cent of the garbage is recycled with nearly 70 per cent of it going into landfills., simply throwing trash into the recycling bin hardly does anything to reduce the production of rubbish; on the contrary it might lull us into a false sense of complacency as heather rogers, the author of gone tomorrow: the hidden life of garbage argues. this is because household waste constitutes a minuscule percentage of the total waste produced, the vast majority of which is constituted by waste from industrial processes. as she shows, the mantra of recycling and green capitalism has been adopted by corporations and big business because it is the least threatening of the options to profit margins — no wonder, the rate of production of goods and, consequently, trash has only increased. more importantly, in this “greenwashing,” the responsibility of cleaning up the environment is displaced from corporations to people themselves in their own individual, personal capacities., economy of ‘zero waste’, to be sure, there are rare examples like germany, which have nearly eliminated landfills, and recycle up to 70 per cent of the waste. but the fact that the cröbern central waste treatment plant in germany, one of the most sophisticated plants in the world (built at a cost of $ 135 million), has been allegedly involved in criminal garbage profiteering by illegally securing solid waste from italy (to sustain the operations of the plant) shows how tenuous and fragile the economy of “zero waste” is.",0.04668962350780531,garbage alter ego,"“that ' whole meaning life ... trying find place stuff ” — george carlin , iconic american comedian , brilliant dissector human

2012-11-03,garbage as our alter ego,"“that's the whole meaning of life ... trying to find a place for your stuff” — george carlin, the iconic american comedian, and that brilliant dissector of the human condition, george carlin, had in a 1986 sketch about “the stuff” shown us how our tendency to acquire more and more stuff — material commodities — generates great anxieties about how and where to store them. even your house is not a home, but “a place to keep your stuff while you go out and get more stuff.” what carlin did not tell us, at least in this sketch, is that much of the stuff does not find a place, it ends up as garbage: as waste, trash and refuse., if there is one thing that is symptomatic of the modern human condition, but hardly recognised as such, it is garbage. garbage is capitalism’s dark underbelly, its pathological alter ego. that is why we keep disavowing it, refusing to believe it exists., vilappilsala standoff, but the more we deny it, it rears its ugly head, as most recently, in vilappilsala panchayat in kerala where the standoff between the local people, who are opposed to the reopening of a waste treatment plant, and the state has left 2 lakh tonnes of solid waste lying unprocessed, threatening an environmental disaster., it is, therefore, remarkable that the current boisterous debate on foreign direct investment in multi-brand retail in india has completely ignored the question of garbage. by focusing only on the supposed virtues of waste reduction in perishable goods (like fruits and vegetables) brought about by the better storage facilities of retail conglomerates, the issue of the latter’s humongous ecological footprint (for example, in terms of sprawl, increase in driving, and the proliferation of non-biodegradable waste) has been bypassed., according to a report from the institute for local self-reliance, washington, d. c., in the 20-year period from 1990, the same period in which walmart grew to be a behemoth, the average number of miles that a u.s. household travelled for shopping increased by around 1000. and from 2005 to 2010, despite walmart’s initiation of a reduced waste programme, its reported greenhouse gas emissions shot up by 14 per cent., big-box stores don’t just improve efficiency in consumption, they also increase consumption manifold, which ultimately results in phenomenal amounts of trash. the garbage generated by americans annually reportedly amounts to 220 million tonnes, and 80 per cent of u.s. goods are used only once before being trashed., in the mythologies of modernisation and development, we sing paeans to skyscrapers and nuclear plants. but there is no accompanying dirge about the costs we have had to pay for them. if there was, then we would have heard of puente hills — the largest active landfill/waste dump in the united states, which is a 1,365-acre monstrosity — as much as we have about the world trade center or the empire state building., it is ironical, edward humes tells us in his book garbology: our dirty love affair with trash, to call puente hills a “landfill,” for the garbage mountain has long ceased to fill a depression in the land and rises now an unbelievable 500 feet above the ground, a space capable of holding 15 million elephants. it takes, of course, a gargantuan effort, as humes describes, to keep the toxic substance that leaks out of the 130-million tonne waste (which includes 3 million tonnes of soiled disposable diapers — another “important” invention of modern life) from poisoning groundwater sources., nevertheless, waste is seen, in popular development discourse as a “third world” problem, the ubiquitous mountains of garbage that blight the face of cities and towns in the poorer parts of the world — one of the first tasks that the newly-elected president in egypt had was cleaning up the garbage mess in cairo. and the citizens of the third world have internalised this discourse, seeing themselves as part of the “dirty” developing world blissfully unaware of the cost at which a “clean” developed world is maintained. thus the story of the somali pirates plundering the high seas has become a part of global lore but not that of somalia being a (cheap) dumping ground for some of the most toxic garbage, including nuclear and medical waste, from europe for the last two decades and more. as long as the streets are clean in frankfurt and paris, does it matter that children are born in somalia without limbs?, ‘waste imperialism’, it is in this context of “waste imperialism” that the question of garbage needs to come out of its subterranean existence and occupy centre stage in any discussion on development, including fdi in retail. it is not accidental that dumping grounds, and waste treatment plants are invariably located in places where the most vulnerable and marginalised sections of the population live, whether in the developed or developing worlds. not surprisingly, garbage has become an important political tool in the present with garbage strikes and struggles around garbage taking place in various cities in the west and elsewhere. the contestation in vilappilsala has been going on since 2000 when the waste treatment plant opened with serious ecological impact., we would be living in a mythical world if we think that the problems of waste can be solved only with better rational planning, management or recycling. in the u.s., even after decades of environmental education, only around 24 per cent of the garbage is recycled with nearly 70 per cent of it going into landfills., simply throwing trash into the recycling bin hardly does anything to reduce the production of rubbish; on the contrary it might lull us into a false sense of complacency as heather rogers, the author of gone tomorrow: the hidden life of garbage argues. this is because household waste constitutes a minuscule percentage of the total waste produced, the vast majority of which is constituted by waste from industrial processes. as she shows, the mantra of recycling and green capitalism has been adopted by corporations and big business because it is the least threatening of the options to profit margins — no wonder, the rate of production of goods and, consequently, trash has only increased. more importantly, in this “greenwashing,” the responsibility of cleaning up the environment is displaced from corporations to people themselves in their own individual, personal capacities., economy of ‘zero waste’, to be sure, there are rare examples like germany, which have nearly eliminated landfills, and recycle up to 70 per cent of the waste. but the fact that the cröbern central waste treatment plant in germany, one of the most sophisticated plants in the world (built at a cost of $ 135 million), has been allegedly involved in criminal garbage profiteering by illegally securing solid waste from italy (to sustain the operations of the plant) shows how tenuous and fragile the economy of “zero waste” is.",0.04668962350780531,garbage alter ego,"“that ' whole meaning life ... trying find place stuff ” — george carlin , iconic american comedian , brilliant dissector human

no. would i like them to be lower and still be able to recover my costs? yes. so what we have to address is the cost issues that we have in india. this is not something that is purely down to what we decide we want to charge. the cost base that we have is enormous. if you look at fuel cost being 50-60 per cent of revenue for most airlines in india you have crossed the comfort zone which is about 35 per cent in most parts of the world. add to this airport charges and exchange rate as all aircraft are leased in dollars and you get the picture., has the permission for you to import fuel helped in any way?, it’s a great step forward. we have run into some bureaucratic issues on getting some of the manuals approved. it’s been a very long winded process but we have only one more stage to cross now. we should be able to place the order for the first batch of fuel imports in the next six weeks., but in practical terms how feasible is this option to import fuel?, we actually have nine separate commercial agreements to manage the transportation of the fuel from its origin to its destination in the aircraft’s fuel tank. this is not easy but it’s not impossible either. it’s pretty complex but doable. i have done this once before in a previous job where i imported fuel from russia into italy. it wasn’t simple then either but it worked. but because of the money involved you need to at least try and i believe it will be successful., how much of a relief will all this give you in terms of costs?, it will be a small relief. last year we spent rs 2,200 crore on fuel. if i can save 1 per cent of that i’m obliged to do it as the ceo. it’s my job. yes, it’s complicated, not easy and business as usual. but that’s my job. even 1 per cent is rs 22 crore. from a shareholder point of view, i’m obliged to at least try. if it doesn’t work fine but it will not be for want of trying., it’s been a year since you inducted the q400 into your fleet. what’s been your experience with the aircraft and with the routes that they are flying?, anybody in india can now connect on a spicejet aircraft thanks to the routes of the q400. the revenues have been fairly good because the customers have limited alternatives., it’s a pretty cheap aircraft to operate because it burns lesser fuel. so we have managed to keep fares at an affordable level. we are running pretty much to business plan now. we have gone from zero to 101 flights a day using the 12 q400s within one year. we committed to buy 15 aircraft but we might slightly delay taking the next couple because the current cost base does not help us to support their operation., so you have been able to tie up seats from these small towns on to major metros through regional hubs…, yes, we have managed to do that but what we find is that more and more people are not connecting like that. they travel from say rajahmundry to hyderabad and return, that is go to the metro for their business and get back. we also find a lot of traffic in the reverse, that is, from the metros to these small towns where the gdp growth is faster than the metros. we have a load factor of 70-75 per cent and expect to break even by the end of the second year of operations., let’s move on to the fdi issue now. are you ready for a foreign partner?, there is very real interest, particularly in spicejet as a carrier, and some interest in india as a destination. people see opportunities in india over time. but the issue is the current cost structure which keeps coming up regularly in discussions, formal and informal., the guys that i spoke to say that given these handicaps, what spicejet has is a unique access into india, particularly because of our network and our reputation. and that’s what these guys want. so, i have spoken to a couple of carriers and there is definite interest. but more airlines in the world have their own issues now. so are they going to be able to do something tomorrow?

2012-11-16,fdi in banking,"as the next session of parliament approaches, the prime minister and the congress party seem adamant about further advancing their programme of financial liberalisation. controversial among their favoured “reforms” is a change in the rules governing foreign investment in india’s banking sector. opposition to this move was one of the issues motivating a two-day strike by around a million bank employees in august this year., but those advocating liberalisation of governance regulations in the form of equity caps for foreign shareholders and caps on voting rights for both domestic and foreign investors are unwilling to listen. they often even suggest that this is an area in which reform has been almost absent or creeping, and is restricting the ability of private banks to mobilise foreign capital to enhance their capital base. but are they right?, the fact of the matter is that governance rules in the banking system have indeed been changed to accommodate the private investor (domestic and foreign) after liberalisation. besides permitting the entry and consolidation of new private banks, the government (through the ministry of commerce) had as far back as march 5, 2004, announced a set of decisions with reference to foreign investment in the banking sector, which relaxed the cap on foreign equity in indian banks to 20 per cent in the case of public sector banks and 74 per cent in the case of private banks. this was in addition to the permission granted to foreign banks to operate in the country through wholly owned subsidiaries subject to increasingly relaxed rules., consequent to the ministry of commerce announcement, the reserve bank of india issued a more detailed and comprehensive set of policy guidelines on ownership of private banks. recognising that the 5th march 2004 notification by the union government had hiked foreign investment limits in private banking to 74 per cent, the guidelines first clarified that this ceiling was applicable to the sum total of foreign investment in private banks from all sources (fdi, foreign institutional investors, non-resident indians)., more importantly, in the interests of diversified ownership the guidelines had declared that no single foreign entity or group could hold more than 10 per cent of equity. there was also a 10 per cent limit set for individual fiis and an aggregate of 24 per cent for all fiis, with a provision that this can be raised to 49 per cent with the approval of the board or general body. finally, the 2004 guidelines set a limit of 5 per cent for individual nri portfolio investors with an aggregate cap for nris of 10 per cent, which can be raised to 24 per cent with board approval., finally, in keeping with this more cautious policy, the rbi decided to retain the stipulation under the banking regulation act, section 12 (2), that in the case of private banks the maximum voting rights per shareholder will be 10 per cent of the total voting rights (1 per cent for public banks). the 10 per cent ceiling on equity ownership by a single foreign entity was partly geared to aligning ownership guidelines with the rule on voting rights., the response to this from liberalisation advocates was that the whole exercise was pointless inasmuch as the ceiling on single investor ownership and voting rights would deter foreign investors. the evidence shows that this expectation has turned out to be completely false. as chart 1 shows, the share of foreign investors in private bank equity exceeds 50 per cent in five banks and stands at between a third and a half in another eight. moreover, chart 2 shows that in a number of instances the share of foreign equity has increased between 2005 (when the guidelines had come into force) and 2012., problems arose only in the case of those entities in which single foreign entities held more than 10 per cent equity. this was, for example, true of the development credit bank (which had the aga khan fund for economic development as lead shareholder with around 25 per cent of equity) and the catholic syrian bank (in which surachan chawla of the siam vidhya group from thailand had acquired 36 per cent shares in the 1990s and has since been able to reduce the total to only 21 per cent). the problem faced by these entities is that of finding buyers willing to acquire small blocks of equity to ensure adequate dilution of lead stakeholder ownership in a bank being run by a dominant foreign shareholder. as a result they have been under pressure for not complying with the rbi’s demand to dilute equity and faced with threats of penal action., the implication of this is clear. the problem with well-performing private banks is not that it is difficult to attract foreign equity investment. the problem is that current rules do not allow entry of those whose intent is to exercise control over a local bank with an adequate share holding and equivalent voting rights. hence, if the need is to allow foreign equity infusion to meet prudential requirements such as the basel norms that is still possible. what is not allowed is the entry of single foreign investors seeking to establish or acquire domestic private banks with a controlling stake and voting rights., the case for such regulation of foreign presence had been clearly specified in the past. the rbi has for long strongly advocated diversified ownership of banks. the rbi’s report on trend and progress of banking in india, 2003-04 states: “concentrated shareholding in banks controlling substantial amount of public funds poses the risk of concentration of ownership given the moral hazard problem and linkages of owners with businesses. corporate governance in banks has therefore, become a major issue. diversified

equity and faced with threats of penal action., the implication of this is clear. the problem with well-performing private banks is not that it is difficult to attract foreign equity investment. the problem is that current rules do not allow entry of those whose intent is to exercise control over a local bank with an adequate share holding and equivalent voting rights. hence, if the need is to allow foreign equity infusion to meet prudential requirements such as the basel norms that is still possible. what is not allowed is the entry of single foreign investors seeking to establish or acquire domestic private banks with a controlling stake and voting rights., the case for such regulation of foreign presence had been clearly specified in the past. the rbi has for long strongly advocated diversified ownership of banks. the rbi’s report on trend and progress of banking in india, 2003-04 states: “concentrated shareholding in banks controlling substantial amount of public funds poses the risk of concentration of ownership given the moral hazard problem and linkages of owners with businesses. corporate governance in banks has therefore, become a major issue. diversified

2013-01-10,"‘cash transfers can help make india less unequal, but are not a magic bullet’","a tribal woman in rayagada, odisha waits to receive coupons to purchase subsidised rice from a fair price shop. | photo credit: manish swarup , the union government has launched the direct benefits transfer (dbt) programme to give benefits like scholarships, pensions, nrega wages, etc. directly to the bank or post office accounts of beneficiaries. there are also talks of direct transfer of subsidies for food, fertilizer and kerosene at a later stage. will the scheme work?, cash transfer can be a good way of helping the poor in many circumstances. indeed, many schemes that are not directly cash transfer schemes also work mainly through cash transfer, such as the national rural employment guarantee programme, which certainly has helped the poor through creating jobs and generating cash income for a great many poor people in rural india. cash is easy to handle and can be, in many cases, easily monitored. it cannot be sensible to be generically against cash transfer schemes, in a country with a lot of poverty and a commitment to use public money to make the very poor a bit less poor., however, the direct benefits transfer (dbt) programme is a particular scheme of cash transfer, and we have to ask what it may be displacing and whether the losers will not be plunged into more poverty. it is not the modality of cash transfer that is the only issue, but also how much, and for whom, and also, instead of what. if, for example, it is instead of subsidised food, we have to make sure that the people who depend on cheaper food will have enough cash to buy the unsubsidised food., there is also another issue — that of the distributional effects of different kinds of benefits within the family. there is a good deal of empirical evidence to suggest that direct access to food tends to favour children rather than only the adults, and also girls rather than only the boys, working against biased social priorities, common in the subcontinent, favouring adults over children, and boys over girls, which is a long-standing problem in indian society. if the cash transfer is not additional to food subsidies, and is given “instead of” food subsidies, it would be important to make sure that the money given would be used for nutritional purposes and, equally importantly, that it would be divided within the family in a way that addresses the manifest problems of undernourishment and deprivation of young girls., further, even if it is made sure that cash transfers will work in a way that meets these difficulties, there may still be a serious problem of transition, especially if there is a time lag in opening an account in a bank, or in a post office, to receive the cash transferred. if, meanwhile, the subsidised food disappears, the poor who fail to open an account adequately fast, for one reason or another, will lose doubly through not having the cash yet, and through the fact that others will have the cash to buy food which would keep the food prices high. the transition problem need not be impossible to handle, but attention will have to be paid to that, bearing in mind that many of the poorer indians lead a life of hand-to-mouth existence, and any delay in the period of transition may plunge some people into extreme hardship. all this is in addition to the long-run problems of the modality of cash transfer, including distributional issues, as well as the adequacy of the amounts of cash transferred., cash transfer can be a very useful system to supplement other ways of making india a less unequal society, but it is not a magic bullet, and its pros and cons have to be assessed and scrutinised with an open mind., the government’s decision to allow fdi in multi-brand retail is being hotly debated in the country. while the congress favours it saying it would give a much-needed boost to the economy and help farmers, the bjp and its allies are against it saying it would badly hurt small retailers and farmers. what precautions does the government need to take while allowing fdi in multi-brand retail?, the first thing to note is that fdi is neither an evil in itself nor a boon in every form. the case for it depends on its actual impact, and that in turn will depend on the choice of field, the amount of money that might come this way, and how it would influence the priorities of economic policies in india. it is not a question of having some abstract principle of “no fdi” — nor one of “any fdi of any kind, anywhere,” irrespective of the impact of any particular fdi on the lives of the people involved. so the issue absolutely is not one of having a generic attitude of being against fdi or being in favour of fdi. it is not like favouring “motherhood” or opposing “satanism.” i can see many areas in which fdi has done good work — and can do more — and other areas in which its effect may be far from beneficial., as far as multi-brand retail is concerned, it is a difficult field, and it is a pity that the broader issue of the attitude to fdi has taken the particular form of asking whether one is in favour of, or against, walmart and other large foreign retail firms becoming a dominant part of the indian retail distribution. this change would certainly help marketing many types of products and would tend to be favoured by, i would expect, farmers and others seeking a large retail outlet. on the other hand, it is very likely that many smaller outlets, like local grocer shops will be hit adversely by the large competition from organised — and sometimes predatory — retail giants., when there are both arguments that are “pro” and some that are “con” about a particular policy change, a good policymaker has to take into account both kinds of effects and evaluate whether the overall impact benefits or harms the indian people. that is not an easy issue to resolve, but of course all planning and all policymaking involve such evaluation. i don’t have a strong view in favour of some fixed conclusion on this particular subject, but i do have a firm conviction that the subject demands public reasoning and critical scrutiny. the issue cannot be resolved by taking a generally “pro” or “anti” attitude about fdi in general. a really serious scrutiny is needed rather than just saying “i am in favour of fdi in retail distribution” or “i am against it.”, recent months have seen widespread anti-corruption demonstrations. how should corruption be tackled?, it is wonderful that people are taking the issue of corruption seriously. that is a very positive achievement. the fact that people have been coming out in the streets protesting and recognising this to be a problem is very important because along with that can come a better understanding of how bad things are in india, and out of that can come the search for a better identification of how corruption can be stopped or checked. corruption need not be an inescapable part of indian life, and we should not accept it on some fatalistic ground that this is the way things are in our country. if you have to give money in order to get something to which you are really entitled, then that certainly calls for protest and exposure of the crooks, not for any kind of quiet acceptance.",0.10091601731601728,"‘cash transfers

laureate joseph stiglitz said here on monday., he was giving a lecture on ‘redefining capitalism,’ organised here by the asian development research institute., professor stiglitz said he was not against fdi as it was “an important instrument of economic growth.” however, its purpose was to reap “capital, technology, access to markets and training.”, without naming the supermarket giant walmart, prof. stiglitz said, “one retailer, which has been widely discussed, has the reputation for bad labour relations, discrimination on the basis of gender, not providing adequate health benefits, and more recently bribery, particularly in the context of mexico.”, in the case of india, it was “unclear” what it was hoping to get from this foreign investor. india’s situation was “particularly interesting and different from other countries.” “right now india is exporting capital. it needs to increase its savings rate more. india has a very large supply of entrepreneurs. it is exporting entrepreneurs to america and countries all over the world. within the country too there is strong entrepreneurship.”, moreover, retail technology was widely available. “and one of the successes of india’s entrepreneurs is they know how to apply our technology. companies in bangalore know how to improvise systems, do operations research,” prof. stiglitz pointed out., “the evidence that despite this company walmart, there have been benefits to small producers is lacking and this is telling,” he said., in the area of financial products too, the nobel laureate had a word of caution for india., “india has to ask before opening its markets to financial products, what they are going to do for promoting growth. the evidence is so overwhelming that these instruments will promote instability that a lot of caution is needed.”, prof. stiglitz called for a greater role for the state in promoting and regulating capitalism, and restructuring the economy., in the context of corporate governance, “failure of the u.s. government to play that role led to the economic crisis … between 1929-1933, farm incomes fell drastically. the economy could not restructure itself until the u.s. government restructured it by moving people from agriculture to manufacturing. markets don’t develop on their own, they need governments to create them,” he said., according to him, the problem before the u.s. today was moving towards a service sector economy. a balance between capitalism, state and civil society was vital for success and growth based not on the obsession with gdp or the “metrics of success”, but taking into account issues of sustainability, distribution and general well-being., “governments have to undertake policies which are people-friendly. growth cannot be

a prime minister who minced no words but one who could never be accused of making preposterous statements in public. nehru however was advantaged by his having a keen sense of world history–books like discovery of india and glimpses of world history authored by him are even today some of the best introductory history texts for indian schoolchildren–which is something undoubtedly lacking in both rahul gandhi and possibly narendra modi., narendra modi has assiduously cultivated foreign governments in the west and in asia, with special emphasis on asian economic giants, china and japan, where he has also led delegations. he has received accolades from overseas for his performance as chief minister–most notably from the united kingdom and also a section of the news media in the united states–after having been at the receiving end of a boycott of sorts for close to a decade in the west. on vexed issues like india-pakistan relations however, seldom has modi moved beyond his standard rhetoric. while he is believed to share a good rapport with sections of the business community in karachi and has made references to the possibility of gujarat-sind inter-state cooperation, his overall tenor vis-a-vis islamabad has been very bellicose. also, in order to keep his support base intact, he is not averse to taking extreme decisions such as the last minute exclusion of pakistani delegates to the “vibrant gujarat” summit in the past and the refusal of the gujarat cricket association –which modi heads – to host the ongoing women's cricket world cup because of the participation of the pakistani national team. the tournament is currently being hosted by orissa, a state led by naveen patnaik of the biju janata dal, a party which cut-off long held ties with the bjp a little over three years ago., beyond pakistan, one has not heard much from modi. the only other references to states in the neighbourhood were to bangladesh (for its inability to control its people from crossing over to india in search of livelihood) and sri lanka (for the plight of tamils in the island nation). with regard to the united states, it is interesting to note that while the chief minister relishes all the praise he receives from american businessmen, think-tanks such as the brookings institution, and the indian diaspora ( a large chunk of whom are gujarati businessman), he has never supported new delhi’s overtures to washington in public, even if they have been purportedly to india’s advantage. whenever the manmohan singh led-united progressive alliance (upa) government has made initiatives in this direction, he has been quick to mock the prime minister. while commenting on the upa government's decision to introduce fdi in retail, modi said that singh only acted like a 'singham' (lion) when under pressure from the americans., while narendra modi's gaffes in the realm of foreign policy get noticed as a consequence of the ‘baggage’ of 2002 and his abrasive public persona, rahul gandhi or the ‘yuvraj’ (youth leader, rather apt as his image on the campaign trail may have led the indian youth congress to victory in the delhi university, counted among the country’s premier central universities, students union elections only a few months ago) of the indian national congress, too, does not particularly have an outstanding world view, if one were to go by his public statements.",0.04279483143119506,neither modi rahul force good india world stage,"ultra-nationalist political posturing decision-making seem yielding political dividends world , going recent trends. centre right leaders like shinzo abe japan david cameron britain taken hard stands sensitive issues also heads states like francois hollande france , belongs political left , done so. monsieur hollande , sending french forces mali take islamist rebels , played active role resuscitation la francafrique , long thought rather torpid state. large degree positions taken statesmen meant draw attention away economic ills countries currently beset by. india , , major national political outfits , bharatiya janata party ( bjp ) indian national congress , trying outdo adoption jingoistic overtones – well illustrated beheading indian soldier killing another international border pakistan became national news country – neither practical feasible long run. , one thing likely prime ministerial candidates , congress vice president rahul gandhi gujarat chief minister narendra modi bjp , share common half-baked understanding foreign policy issues. guilty making rash statements domestic election campaigns. gone days jawaharlal nehru ;

now into films as well.” one can sense a halo around chetan bhagat these days. in the morning you can find him addressing an opinion piece to rahul gandhi, on your way to work you see youngsters flipping the pages of catching up with revolution 2020 in a bustling metro. in the evening you catch him on tv giving a piece of his mind to somebody asking for a solution that very night. he is no longer the author type, as soon he might be seen driving a ford endeavour to gujarat on national geographic channel. and how can you miss kai po che, the latest cinematic adaptation of his novel? he is here, there, everywhere, but the boy who made english fiction lose its elitist tag has a realistic take on his prowess., revolution 2020 kai po che, “i don’t want youngsters to gather an impression that you can switch careers whenever you like. it takes years to build credibility. i have just started.”, but he doesn’t look like a person who will indulge in adventures like a road trip. “my adventures are mental. and i have opted to go to gujarat because i want to understand the state and its people. i want to reach out to rural india and hope that one day a farmer would be able to read a chetan bhagat novel.”, gujarat is also the backdrop of his novel the 3 mistakes of my life, which is the source of abhishek kapoor’s kai po che. chetan has contributed to the screenplay and this time his experience has been sweet. “it is not a flashy film about friendship, where guys move in convertibles. it is very realistic and quite a faithful adaptation of the novel.” recently critics found salman rushdie’s attempt to adapt his midnight’s children rather disappointing, but chetan says he doesn’t face a rushdie kind of problem because his novels are popular and lend themselves easily to cinematic adaptation., chetan first discovered gujarat when he was studying at iim-ahmedabad and observed the communalisation of the atmosphere from close quarters. it found a reflection in his novel where the gujarat riots formed the turning point. “i am glad the film got made. instead of pushing it under the carpet, we need to come to terms with it, take lessons from it, make a commitment that such a thing doesn’t happen again and move on.”, when big stars backed out (farhan akhtar opted out because he didn’t want to be seen in another film on friendship after rock on and zindagi na milegi dobara), chetan got apprehensive about the fate of the project, but when utv came on board, things got sorted out smoothly. “we don’t get to see a realistic and contemporary portrayal of gujaratis in our teleserials. we need more such films.”, talking about writing letters to political leaders in his columns, chetan says, “it makes the person more accountable as it becomes personal.” the urge to shift to non-fiction came three years back. “i had a big platform for fiction, but i always had the desire to suggest changes in the way the country is run. people don’t know that i have some training in advising governments. when i was working in thailand i was in the rating advisory group of my organisation. i advised the governments of thailand and philippines on their credit ratings, which means understanding all the government data and advising the governments on fdi and balance of payments issues. that knowledge was not being used.” now he is called by cabinet ministers. “sometimes they call because they understand a lot of young people follow my writing. sometimes they call to agree with me. sometimes they call to challenge me. i always believe in dialogue. i am not a crusader. i feel the change could happen through the system. when i wrote on air india, i was called by the minister of civil aviation.”, recently a compilation of his essays came out in the form of what young india wants (rupa). while taking an extreme position gets attention and seems heroic at times, he feels, “ultimately the real change-makers know when to push for change and when to shake hands. seeking consensus is an art. we can argue that the democratic process need not be that slow, but ultimately it is the lasting impact that matters.”, he maintains the anna movement deserved a lot of respect but at the same time believes that the government’s point of view should also be taken into account. “i know the government doesn’t want to pass the lokpal bill, but even if you pass it, it is the government which has to implement it. what if they pass it and no ias officer clears the file using possible lokpal scrutiny as the shield to delay the process. that is not corruption, but it amounts to harming the nation.”, he suggests negotiation as the way forward. “nations cannot be changed overnight. you can seek an idea but you have to cut a deal. now some call it shrewd, some find it not very pure, it is even equated to selling out. i mean, i have done it in my books. i have not been a purist and i get a lot of flak for it as well, but because i am flexible and adaptive, i have come this far.”, calling delhi the city of chat and corruption, he feels the people involved in the anti-corruption movement need to learn from the mistakes they have made. “there was a time when the government was really engaged with them and they needed to strike a deal. there is a difference between creating a movement and sustaining a movement. if i have to stay relevant to my readers, i have to come up with fresh ideas. first they started with the corruption thing but soon they became a symbol of hope and aspiration for youngsters. indians want a better life. they began to believe that anna could get them bijli, sadak, paani. anna couldn’t have got it for them and that was bound to lead to despair. i give a lot of ideas but i don’t make promises that i can’t keep.”, he says the moment you start playing to the media’s tune, things go awry. “they thought they were using the media, but i think it was the other way round. they have smart people; they should have figured it out.”",0.1336854811854812,pointsman arrives,"chetan bhagat keeps traversing serious frivolous. photo : s. subramanium , “life movie. ’ solution two hours. know films well. ” one sense halo

2013-02-26,need to demystify the budget process,"pre-budget hype is like the first day of a test match — the excitement is over once the fiscal announcements are made just like the die-down in hype once the first ball is bowled. year-on-year the mystery shrouding the budget-making process continues unabated., the immediate need is to rethink the budget making process and make it transparent. one of the first steps in this direction needs to be the involvement of academicians and industry experts in the budget formulating process. why not circulate a draft of the budget and discuss the same with the public (similar to system followed in other countries such as new zealand)?, ‘aam admi’s’ budget expectations, the double whammy of rising inflation costs and limited avenues for tax planning for individuals leaves them quite vulnerable. towards this end, the government should consider increasing the basic exemption limits for individual tax payers to factor the rising cost of living (especially the salaried-class)., on the other hand, the government should also aim to increase the quantum of deduction under tax saving avenues (for example, section 80c act deductions). offering tax deductions on savings is a time-tested method of luring citizens in tax saving instruments. therefore, the government may consider increasing the quantum of deductions under such instruments to rs.2.50 lakh., as a corollary to the objective of increasing the rate of savings among the middle-class, and also to directly link the savings with the primary/secondary market, the government may consider allowing exemptions from capital gains where such gains are re-invested into shares of private unlisted and public listed companies., this would help in achieving a faster rate of corporatisation of the unorganised sector leading to greater emphasis on responsible reporting and corporate governance., rising medical bills, another aspect which the government should consider is the rising medical bills and cost of hospitalisation. the current caps on tax deduction for the same should be increased to provide relief to the middle-class. the government may consider increasing the same to rs.1 lakh, given the absence of a national health care/social security system., while the normal tax rate applicable to an indian company is 30 per cent, the add-ons like ddt, surcharge and the like push it close to 42 per cent. the effective tax rate compares favourably with high-tax nations such as the u.s.and japan. one also needs to factor the impact of the minimum alternate tax (mat) of around 20 per cent. therefore, one of the immediate demands of the corporate sector would be to reduce the applicable tax rate to 25 per cent and doing-away with the add-on taxes., secondly, the rising litigation on the difference between book profits for mat purposes and the profits considered for normal tax purposes needs to be resolved. bringing in the much awaited/anticipated direct taxes code (dtc) (with appropriate amendments) could be considered for the same. extension of tax holidays (which have already expired in most cases) could also be considered to improve fdi inflows., last year, the government introduced the concept of transfer pricing on domestic transactions. the government may also consider bringing in the concept of advance rulings in the domestic tax scenario as well. “clarity, certainty and cost effectiveness” is what corporate india wants today. business plans and projections are made on this basis. unforeseen tax demands could destroy business models.",0.06229459316194009,need demystify budget process,"pre-budget hype like first day test match — excitement fiscal announcements made like die-down hype first ball bowled. year-on-year mystery shrouding budget-making process continues unabated. , immediate need rethink budget making process make transparent. one first steps direction needs involvement academicians industry experts budget formulating process. circulate draft budget discuss public ( similar system followed countries new zealand ) ?

2013-03-02,an opportunity missed,"“the purpose of a >budget – and the job of a finance minister,” p. chidambaram declared in his speech, “is to create the economic space and find the resources to achieve the socio economic objectives.” now that the presentation of and the spate of initial responses to the budget are behind us, it may be appropriate to ask how far the minister went in accomplishing his self-defined task., mr. chidambaram was handed the management of the nation’s fisc at a time when growth was slowing, inflation high and the current account deficit widening ominously. reversing the slowdown required an expansion in expenditure. and this needed to be financed in ways that took account of inflation and the widening external deficit. since, for right or wrong reasons, mr. chidambaram is also with those who believe that the fiscal deficit needs trimming, the requirement was a large dose of additional resource mobilisation. fortunately, additional taxation was not just needed, but also possible. as the finance minister noted, at around 10 per cent of gdp, the tax to gdp ratio was “one of the lowest for any large developing country” and well below the 2007-08 peak of 11.9 per cent. so ‘reclaiming that peak’ was the obvious short-term objective., ten per cent surcharge, however, mr. chidambaram does not seem to have stretched himself to do that. in terms of taxation the only noteworthy initiative was the imposition of a >10 per cent surcharge on individuals and corporations with taxable incomes exceeding rs. 1 crore. given the large number of concessions and exemptions available, the number of tax-paying entities falling in this range is small. the minister himself provides a figure of a paltry 42,800 individuals who qualify. they were, thus far, being taxed at 30.90 per cent on their taxable incomes in excess of rs. 10,00,000. now, they would pay the new marginal rate of just 33.99 per cent only on that part of their income that exceeds more than 10 times this sum. the effect on revenues cannot be substantial. not surprisingly, despite the finance minister’s optimistic projections on tax buoyancy, the tax to gdp ratio is expected to rise by just half a percentage point in 2013-14. the task of finding resources has not been pursued seriously., if tax revenues are not slated to rise enough, non-tax receipts or expenditure cuts must ensure deficit reduction. mr. chidambaram has relied heavily on both. “miscellaneous” capital receipts from measures such as disinvestment or the sale of spectrum are projected at rs. 55,814 crore in 2013-14, as compared to a revised figure of rs. 24,000 crore for 2012-13 and a budgeted figure of rs. 30,000 crore for last year. the state of the markets and the recent experience with spectrum sale suggest this projection would be difficult to realise even if the best assets are put up for sale., but even after incorporating these uncertain receipts, the budget has had to rein in expenditures to meet its deficit target. in a year (2013-14) when gdp is projected to grow by 13.4 per cent, total expenditure is expected to rise by only 11.7 per cent budget-to-budget. this implies a lower expenditure to gdp ratio and a reduced fiscal stimulus. as a result, despite the election due around a year from now, the so-called “flagship” schemes of the upa have not been favoured with larger allocations. allocations for the mgnregs, for example, are budgeted at rs. 33,000 crore in 2013-14, which is the same as budgeted in 2012-13 and marginally above the rs. 29,387 crore actually spent that year. in addition, expenditure reduction is being realised largely through curbs on >food and fertilizer subsidies and a steep reduction in the petroleum subsidy from rs. 96,880 crore to rs. 65,000 crore. the latter would feed into the costs of a range of products and aggravate inflation., finally, there has been little attention paid to balance of payments correction. one item that has contributed to the widening trade and current account deficit is the import of gold. increasing further the duty on >gold imports was the way to go, since there is no justification whatsoever for a small minority to use the nation’s foreign exchange resources to purchase the yellow metal whether as ornament or investment. instead, the finance minister has chosen to send out a signal encouraging the import of gold by raising the duty-free limit for import of jewellery through the baggage route., put together, these indications from the budget suggest that the finance minister had either not given thought to or ignored the tasks that circumstances had set for him. all he managed to do was juggle his numbers to show off a lower fiscal deficit of 4.8 per cent in 2013-14. that will please no one. however, there are a considerable number who would resent being harmed by the effect that the budget would have on livelihoods and real earnings. this being the last full budget of upa ii before the next general elections, effective measures aimed at showing concern for those who are chronically poor and distressed were a necessity. yet the finance minister failed to accomplish the tasks he had implicitly set himself., the budget speech seems to provide one hint of what could be influencing the government’s inexplicable policy drift. the finance minister has explained why the current account deficit (cad) is a cause for worry as follows: “this year, and perhaps next year too, we have to find over usd 75 billion to finance the cad. there are only three ways before us: fdi, fii or external commercial borrowing. that is why i have been at pains to state over and over again that india, at the present juncture, does not have the choice between welcoming and spurning foreign investment. if i may be frank, foreign investment is an imperative.”, two demands, even a cursory survey of the views expressed by representatives of foreign direct and portfolio investors makes clear that there are two demands they consistently make of the countries they target. the first is that the government should display fiscal prudence in the form of a small fiscal deficit and limited public borrowing. the second is that there must be a continuous stream of “reform” announcements that liberalise the terms of entry and operation of foreign private capital. in recent times the government fearing an exit of capital launched on a new round of reform showcased by the decision to permit fdi in multi-brand retail. however, the fiscal deficit has been high by the standards set by foreign observers. the finance minister may be operating on the presumption or may have received a signal that if foreign capital inflows to finance the cad have to be found, the fiscal deficit has to be controlled.",0.006666551533572806,opportunity missed,"“the purpose >budget – job finance minister , ” p. chidambaram declared speech , “is create economic space find resources

2013-03-03,‘we will not sell under cost’,"r.rajesh | photo credit: r.rajesh , at a time when airlines are dumping millions of seats at heavily discounted fares to create demand, the wadia group’s goair is still sticking to its conservative approach., in a recent interview with the hindu, giorgio de roni, ceo, go airlines, maintains that he will not follow the trend but instead concentrate on delivering profitable growth., excerpts:, the indian airline industry is reeling under massive losses. how is business at goair?, we definitely are in a challenging environment. demand is going down. in the april to december period, demand decreased by 6 per cent. however, during this period go air increased its number of passengers by 15 per cent., i would not say we are extremely happy, but we are satisfied. as per forecast, india will be the third largest market worldwide by 2020, and we are very confident that we will be able to contribute to this growth. so far, we have had a very cautious approach in terms of growth. from 2016 to 2020 we expect a steeper growth rate and for that we placed an order for 72 new aircraft in 2011., we are following our strategy, and we are on track. as we often say, we are not running a sprint, we are running a marathon, and will be here for a long period., has your conservative approach helped?, our vision has been to grow and to sustain our growth. india is now constrained in terms of regulations, and there is problem in cost. just to give you an idea, from 2010 to october 2012, the price of fuel went up by 79 per cent. so having more aircraft in the air meant having a higher cost. we had a cautious approach in order to maintain continuity and profitability. however, we forecast that the market will grow significantly in the future, and that is why we have put an order for 72 new airbus a320 aircraft to be delivered between 2016 and 2020., what is your network expansion plan?, currently, we are operating 108 flights a day and operating from 22 airports. we will get 8 new aircraft by july 2014, and our strategy is to increase frequencies in the existing routes and add new routes., how viable is goair, financially?, fuel represents 54 per cent of our cost. if we include navigation charges, it is as high as 70 per cent. we also suffer in terms of devaluation of the rupee., thus, we are working in a very challenging environment. despite that, we are able to deliver profit. as i told you, our vision is to have a sustainable airline. definitely, it is important for us to expand our network, but our stress is on profitability., we want to deliver a profitable project. otherwise, it does not make sense. other competitors, who followed a completely different strategy, have run into some inconvenience., so, we learnt a lesson from that. we need a stronger and more profitable airline business., why are you not flying international?, our core business will remain domestic for a long time as we strongly believe in its potential., however, indian regulations require a minimum of five years operations and a minimum of 20 aircraft in the fleet to be eligible to fly international. thus, we are not allowed. i think this is unfair not only to goair but also to the system., foreign airlines with just two aircraft are allowed to fly here. thus, the indian government is penalising its companies and citizens. last year, we had applied for a waiver to fly international. we are confident that we will receive an approval., that said, the domestic market will remain our core, and the opportunity to fly international will just open new opportunities for better utilisation of our aircraft. currently, our aircraft utilisation is the highest, at more than 13 hours a day, and, by flying international, we may increase the aircraft utilisation and make our cost structure more efficient for the benefit of our customers. we can transfer the benefit to customers through more appealing fares., all international airlines are looking at investing in indian carriers after the recent policy change. is anyone talking to you?, fdi is a very good option for cash availability. it will also import best practices. as a management, we need to analyse every opportunity. we are evaluating. the shareholders will take the appropriate decision., despite the adverse business climate, airlines are slashing fares. what is your approach?, in three years up to march 2012, indian airlines lost rs. 8,000 crore. this is due to an inefficient cost structure, heavy taxation and infrastructure problems. some airlines were interested in increasing market share rather than thinking about profitability. they dropped fares to get additional market share. this is not our approach. we want to deliver value for money., but we don’t want to deliver value for money today and not be there in the market tomorrow. we try to provide the most appealing fare but at every increase in cost, we will transfer it to customers. we can’t operate by losing money. now we are facing a weak season, so of course there will be some pressure. i will not comment on some actions implemented by some airlines, but go air is not going to follow this path. we will not sell under cost. it can’t be. we will follow our strategy, and so far this strategy has been rewarding., goair was the first low-cost airline to offer business class seats. how has the experience been?, we are very satisfied. we are reporting significant seat occupancy. in terms of pricing, the value proposition is amazing. while our competitors are charging over rs. 30,000 for a one-way business class seat in the delhi-mumbai sector, our business class seat comes at almost one third of that cost. so, our product has become highly successful. we are trying to further improve it., what are some concerns that you think the government should address?",0.23099494949494956,‘we sell cost ’,"r.rajesh &#124; photo credit : r.rajesh ,

2013-03-20,"after dmk, samajwadi party turns the heat on upa","samajwadi party chief mulayam singh yadav in the lok sabha on monday. , after the dmk pull out, the samajwadi party, a key outside supporter,on wednesday kept the upa government on tenterhooks by demanding the resignation of union minister beni prasad verma for his controversial remarks against sp chief mulayam singh yadav., not happy with mr. verma just expressing regret for his remarks, mr. yadav met prime minister manmohan singh and later had an interaction with congress chief sonia gandhi, who was seen talking to him with folded hands in the lok sabha after the house had adjourned., a grim-looking mr. yadav said he has convened a meeting of sp mps on thursday at 9 a.m. “we will hear their views and then decide,” he told reporters while leaving parliament on being asked his party’s stand after mr. verma’s regret. the sp has 22 mps in the lok sabha., sp has said it is not satisfied with mr. verma’s “regret” and wants an unconditional apology from the minister, who was once close to mr. yadav. “there is a difference between regret and apology,” sp leader shailendra kumar said after mr. yadav met the prime minister., meeting with pawar, even as congress leaders made desperate attempts to placate mr. yadav, the sp chief met ncp leader sharad pawar, fuelling speculation of a political realignment at a time when the buzz of mid-term poll gains ground., both the leaders, however, played down the meeting saying they had only discussed modalities of a programme they are to attend together on march 24., the meeting of the two leaders comes in the backdrop of the sp demanding mr. verma’s resignation and the dmk ruling out reconsideration of its stand on withdrawing support to the government., a day after withdrawing its support, the five dmk ministers in the union cabinet today tendered their resignations to prime minister manmohan singh., dmk is second party to leave the upa. last year, the mamata banerjee-led trinamool congress had quit the upa on the issue of fdi in multi-brand retail., while ncp is a key constituent of the upa, sp extends outside support to the government. these developments have come at a time when government said the crisis has blown over and “the matter is closed“., between adjournments in the lok sabha, congress president sonia gandhi and home minister sushilkumar shinde met yadav separately and are understood to have conveyed to him that the congress strongly disapproved of mr. verma’s remarks., with the dmk pullout, the strength of the upa in the lok sabha has been reduced to 224 but it enjoyed the support of 281 mps that included those of parties supporting from outside. besides sp, bsp with 21 lok sabha mps is among the crucial outside supporters totalling 57., the lok sabha has 539 mps at present as four seats are vacant. the half-way mark is 270., in the lok sabha, leader of the opposition sushma swaraj said mr. verma had tarnished the image of the sp chief who was “a respected leader of the house. he should either prove his charges or apologise.”, mr. verma had alleged that mr. yadav had links with terrorists, triggering vehement protests from the sp., ms. swaraj said after making such “disparaging remarks,” mr. verma had “no right to continue in office.” she said the bjp and sp may have political differences, but “this is a matter of privilege of the house.”, ms. gandhi, who was present in the house and was watching the new bonhomie between sp and bjp, walked up to mr. yadav soon after the lok sabha was adjourned around noon. though she was not audible to reporters in the press gallery, ms. gandhi was seen talking to mr. yadav with folded hands., earlier, parliamentary affairs minister kamal nath had said that the “matter is closed” after he had expressed regret in the lok sabha for mr. verma’s remarks., congress displeasure, the congress had expressed displeasure over mr. verma’s remarks saying it had “taken this issue very seriously“., the sp chief’s son and uttar pradesh chief minister akhilesh yadav said “it is true that there is upheaval at the centre and counting of numbers has started to know whether the government would survive or not.”, “as far as support to the upa is concerned, netaji (mulayam) will take the decision. our entire central leadership is in

2013-03-21,restrict foreign access to the bar,"“the economic survey has strongly batted for the removal of the restrictions on foreign direct investment (fdi) in legal and accountancy services” (>the hindu, february 28, 2013). opening up the legal services sector for foreign lawyers is being debated for over 18 years. predominantly, foreign law firms want to practise as consultants (flcs) and not in court. government apathy, unthinking bureaucratic support to foreign law firms, total disconnect with the legal profession, absence of national policy objectives and dubious behaviour by foreign law firms in the past have clouded the whole issue., delhi bar council challenge, in 1994, michael fysh qc appeared before the delhi high court to argue a case representing a multi-national company. an objection was taken by the bar council of delhi challenging his right to appear. this incident catapulted the controversy nationally., the bar association of india (bai), the premier voluntary association of lawyers functioning for over 50 years, immediately reacted as far back as october 5, 1994. a resolution for setting up a task force and a high powered committee was suggested. the plea fell on deaf ears., the bar council of india consistently passed several resolutions between 2002 and 2007 opposing the opening up of the indian legal profession to foreign lawyers or foreign law firms while emphasising the absence of specific proposals by the central government, and has recorded a desire to continue a dialogue and interaction with the government of india., the general agreement on trade and services (gats) emphasises the right of members to regulate trade and services. briefly, the core concepts of gats are non-discriminatory and equality of treatment of all members. in an annex on movement of natural persons, an exception is carved out offering a clear impediment to indian professionals working abroad., bombay litigation, three large international law firms viz. white & case, chadbourne & parke and ashurst morris crisp applied to the foreign investment promotion board (fipb) for starting branches in india. their applications were rejected., thereafter, they successfully applied under the (now repealed) foreign exchange regulation act 1973 (fera) for a licence or permission to open a liaison office under section 29 for “carrying on any activity of a trading, commercial or industrial nature.” they surprisingly did not apply under section 30 “to practise a profession or occupation.”, a disingenuous stand by high-ranking professional firms through a dubious route. they leveraged their position by employing the kin of powerful serving and retired bureaucrats. the indian express was more to the point — “the first set of clearances was granted after a delegation of foreign law firms, under the leadership of the son of the union minister of law, met officials of the rbi.”, an ngo called ‘lawyers collective’ filed and succeeded in a public interest litigation (pil) in the bombay high court challenging these permissions., the legal profession and the public owe a debt of gratitude to the crusading and dedicated efforts of indira jaising, anand grover and, later, chander uday singh representing the “lawyers collective” which exposed the attempt of the foreign law firms to gain a backdoor entry with government support in the lucrative legal services sector bypassing the advocates act., most countries, including australia, hong kong and south korea, prohibit foreign law firms from practising domestic law and also provide for registration under strict regulations for practising foreign or international law., a case that is referred to in the bombay judgment arose in the new york court of appeals. one lorenzo roel started practising mexican law in new york and contended that as his practice was restricted to mexican law, he did not practise law in new york. this contention was rejected. the court held: “… whether a person gives advice as to new york law, federal law, the law of a sister state, or the law of a foreign country, he is giving legal advice …”, in the final judgment (swatanter kumar cj and j.p. devadhar j.) delivered on december 16, 2009, the prima facie view expressed at the interlocutory stage by chief justice m.b. shah and justice s.h. kapadia (later cji) was confirmed. the bombay high court held that “the reserve bank of india was not justified in granting permission to foreign law firms to open liaison office in india under section 29 of the act” and that practising the profession of law under the advocates act covered both litigation practice as well as “persons practising in non-litigious matter”., nothing could be clearer. practice of foreign law was covered as non-litigious practice under the advocates act. the judgment has not been appealed from and has reached finality, and binds the government., madras litigation, later another petition (pil) was filed in the madras high court by a.k. balaji. the government contended before the madras high court that “the bar council of india, which has been established under the advocates act, 1961, regulates the advocates who are on the rolls but law firms as such are not required to register themselves before any statutory authority nor do they require any permission to engage in non-litigation practice.”, this is directly contrary to the bombay judgment which is binding on the government. the madras high court while following the bombay judgment surprisingly deviated from it and made several concessions to the benefit of foreign lawyers which were vigorously supported by the governmental authorities. the bar council of india has appealed to the supreme court. by an interlocutory order, the court has only permitted foreign lawyers to visit india for a temporary period on a “fly-in and fly-out” basis for the purposes of giving legal advice to their clients in india regarding foreign laws. in the absence of strict monitoring, this exception is likely to cause grave abuse., the law commission of india, in a working paper in 1999, raised pertinent issues and concerns while recommending amendments to the advocates act to prepare a level-playing field for indian lawyers., government apathy and opacity, on september 20, 2004, the u.k.-india joint declaration was made in london. the u.k.-india joint economic and trade committee (jetco) was set up to provide recommendations on the possibility of opening up legal services in india. it appears that reports were made by the two teams but they are not in the public domain. it is understood that during the jetco meetings, some indian delegates were unequivocally informed by the u.k. team that they would emasculate indian firms and pick and choose the attorneys from indian firms so as to destroy capabilities and create their own strengths. u.k. firms had no interest in joint ventures with indian firms which could help assimilate new technologies and know-how and training. it is however gathered that thereafter no significant progress has been made.",0.08843986079280197,restrict foreign access bar,"“the

2013-03-29,fdi in defence sector would be an effective catalyst for self-reliance,"dick olver , bae systems, a defence, aerospace and security company, employs 93,500 people worldwide. its wide-ranging products and services cover air, land and naval forces, as well as advanced electronics, security, information technology, and support services., with a presence that goes back over 60 years, bae systems has developed india as a home market with a strategic vision to become a major and integral part of the domestic indian defence and security industry, leveraging its global expertise to develop technologies and solutions in india for both the indian market and for export., it has a joint venture in india with hindustan aeronautics – baeha. based in bangalore, it is focused on providing engineering and business solutions services. bae systems has a long-standing association with hal on aircraft programmes such as jaguar, harrier, and now, the hawk advanced jet trainer which hal manufactures under licence for the indian air force and navy., the board of bae systems, led by its global chairman dick olver, visited india for the first time. in this e-mail interview to the hindu, he outlines the company’s plans for india., what is the board’s overall impression of the market in india?, bae systems has a long association with india in many areas of aerospace and defence, with all three of the indian armed services — dating back to pre-independence times. i have personally had an opportunity to visit india many times — most recently in february as part of prime minister cameron’s delegation. and, i am thrilled to lead the visit of the bae systems plc board here this week. india is an incredible country. it is a key market for our company. so, i was keen that my fellow directors had the opportunity to see and experience that first hand. we have a solid team here, who are privileged to work with some exceptional people across the customer community and through our relationships with indian companies. the board has been impressed with what we have seen and experienced during our visit., the indian market holds considerable opportunities for us, and i and the other directors are very excited and energised by the potential that exists here, illustrated by the steady trend in defence expenditure at around 2 per cent of gdp, a stated intent of $100 billion worth of acquisitions over the next five years, and the focus on self-reliance in defence., a personal highlight was the launch of the mobile mini hospital called ‘smile on wheels’ that will provide primary healthcare services to underserved communities in bangalore. the mini hospital is part of the company’s corporate social responsibility programme in india through which we support development programmes in the areas of primary education and healthcare in rural and urban communities across seven states of india. ., bae has had a longstanding association with hal on the india hawk and even has a jv with the aerospace major. how do you view the future of the relationship?, our relationship with hal for the indian hawk programme is the cornerstone of our operations in india today. we are privileged to enjoy a strong relationship with hal, and our latest collaboration is for the licence to build hawk advanced jet trainer. india has ordered a quantity of 123 aircraft with another 20 in negotiation., having the experience of working together to create advanced fast jets built in india, both hal and bae systems would like to progress the relationship and broaden the collaboration between our respective organisations. we also have an engineering services and business solutions joint venture with hal called baehal. although relatively small in size, we believe this is strategically important, and both partners have ambitions to grow the jv over time., building domestic capabilities in partnership with indian companies will remain a cornerstone of our strategy in india., bae systems has been an advocate for the relaxation of the fdi rules in defence. but it hasn’t happened so far. recently raghuram rajan, chief economic advisor to the government, has suggested liberalisation of fdi norms in the sector. does that make you hopeful that the voice of companies such as yours will be heard soon?, i have noted that there has been increased emphasis in recent weeks in india on the growing importance of more rapid indigenisation of the defence sector. in addition to the economic benefits, increased jobs, improved capability and the development of critical technology , indigenisation would ensure india has ready access to the best available defence equipment., in support of that objective, in my view, an appropriate increase in fdi in the defence sector would be the most effective catalyst for self-reliance, and, for that reason, i am hopeful that liberalisation in fdi will occur. we understand and respect the government’s position, and we are here for the long-term regardless of changes in fdi to fully support a more rapid development of a vibrant, indigenous defence sector in this country., what should india be doing to develop a strong domestic aerospace and defence industry?, the fdi issue we just discussed is obviously a part of that equation. i also think international companies need to be cognizant of and able to address the complexities of technology transfer, and we need the indian industrial base to work with us on this., i am also a strong believer in the importance of education and the investment that is needed in order to sustain a country’s ability to grow and remain competitive. for india, this is a fascinating opportunity and challenge given its young population and its fast-growing economy., a strong domestic aerospace and defence industry needs to be underpinned by world-class productivity and powered by high-value engineering skills and education. to do this, you need the right skills in the right places at the right time and in the right quantities., getting all that right is not easy. but when you do, the effect is electrifying. look at silicon valley in the u.s. or the u.k.’s high-tech and biotech cluster around cambridge. closer to home, the indian it services sector is a world-class example of skill development, training and education coming together

2013-04-10,rahul gandhi’s dragon cliché,"in his speech to the confederation of indian industry (cii) on april 4, 2013, congress vice-president rahul gandhi said his advisers had told him to “not go into the india-china cliché.” mr. gandhi should have paid heed to them. for the heir-apparent of a major political party — and a possible prime ministerial candidate — mr. gandhi, during his more than an hour-long interaction, came across as worryingly ill-informed about a country that is not only india’s biggest neighbour and single largest trading partner, but also set to emerge as possibly india’s most important, and difficult, diplomatic challenge in the next decade., “there is no complexity in china,” he declared, going on to present an anecdote which, he suggested, reflected life in the people’s republic. “a friend of mine who came from china, an italian guy, was in shock,” he recounted. “he said, ‘i was in a bus in china. a bus hit a man. the driver picked up the man, put him on the side of the road and we carried on’.” “there is no complexity there,” mr. gandhi concluded. “simple, china is.”, mr. gandhi used this rather strange anecdote to make the claim that as india and china were fundamentally different countries, their development experiences and growth stories could not be compared. hit-and-run incidents are no more commonplace in china than they are in india, and arriving at a simple conclusion about a billion people based on the testimony of one foreign visitor would be a misguided venture in either country, “there are two types of systems, centralised and decentralised,” he argued. “china is a centralised system. they call it, the dragon. you can see it, it is very clear. it is big, it is powerful, it builds big structures that are visible.” india, he went on to say, was “a beehive.” his apparent argument was that unlike china’s centralised and organised development model, india’s growth story was entirely a bottom-up process driven by creative energy and the spirit of entrepreneurship, and not by the state., the real lesson, there was much about mr. gandhi’s rather sweeping and simplistic characterisation of what he called the “india-china cliché” that does not bear scrutiny. the argument that a decentralised democracy slows development and hinders the delivery of good governance, and that china’s remarkable growth story over the past three decades was more the result of a strong one-party state than any other factor, has been made frequently — including by china’s own ruling communist party, as well as sections of india’s business elite with cases of china-envy., this is despite the fact that the widely popular perception of china’s economic development being the outcome of an entirely top-down, state-driven, centralised process has been disproven by compelling evidence to the contrary. the ubiquitous caricature of china’s growth story — decades of double-digit growth and rapid state-led infrastructure development driven by foreign direct investment (fdi) and a thriving export sector — is limited to the country’s experience in the 1990s. as economists such as huang yasheng of the massachusetts institute of technology (mit) and others have pointed out, china’s growth story began a decade earlier in the 1980s preceding the infrastructure boom., as mr. huang has argued convincingly, growth in the 1980s was as much “bottom-up” as “top-down,” driven by rural entrepreneurs who benefited from the loosening of state controls, more liberal policies and decentralisation. china’s record of reducing poverty, mr. huang has shown, was the highest during the 1980s, when the number of poor fell by 154 million. the following decade of fdi-led growth saw a reduction in the number of poor by a relatively fewer 62 million. china’s growth in the 1980s was underpinned by investments in human capital — in boosting health care and education. that, according to mr. huang, is the real lesson from china’s growth story – not a superficial fascination with skyscrapers and high gdp., india and china certainly have vastly different political systems. a strong party-state has, no doubt, allowed china to enact policies rapidly. yet, one-party rule has also imposed huge burdens on china’s development. mao zedong’s disastrous great leap forward of the late 1950s, which claimed more than 30 million lives, and the cultural revolution (1966-76), set china back by at least a few decades. today, china’s political model is seen, even in beijing, as stifling innovation and creative industries. no sensible person would suggest following china’s authoritarian model, which would have no place in india’s diverse and plural society — a stark contrast from china’s han-dominated society which offers far from adequate protection to minorities., comparing social indicators, mr. gandhi was, however, wrong to dismiss out of hand the lessons from china’s growth story, and to simply attempt to explain away india’s development problems using questionable assumptions, rather than put forward new ideas or a vision for the future. mr. gandhi, correctly, mounted a passionate defence of india’s pluralistic and democratic political system. but implicit in his comments was the troubling suggestion that the expectations of people in decentralised, “beehive” india could not be held to the same levels as those in centralised, authoritarian china. foreigners who were “driven crazy” by india’s chaos could succeed in doing business “even on the moon” if they succeeded in india, he said almost proudly, rather than suggest how he might perhaps help improve the environment for business and investment., he would do well to ponder why china has done far better in providing its people with basic necessities, why china continues to outperform india on every social indicator; and most importantly, and why the gap between both countries has widened — and not narrowed — following a decade of the united progressive alliance’s (upa) rule. according to the united nations human development report, china is far ahead of india on social indicators ranging from life expectancy (73.7 years against 65.8), mean years of schooling (7.5 years against 4.4), adult literacy (94 per cent against 74 per cent), under-five mortality (19 per 1,000 against 66) and maternal mortality (38 per 100,000 against

what are the challenges you foresee in their implementation as elections are drawing close?, i believe that the critical reform agenda is now largely in the domain of state governments. priority areas other than gst include distribution reforms in the power sector, modification of the apmc act to de-notify perishables, land reforms to allow leasing of land and procedural reforms to improve ease of doing business., the central government needs to ease the fdi limits in financial sectors such as insurance and pensions to make more resources available for growth. these require legislative changes, and, are currently on the government’s agenda., tax evasion by companies has become the topic of the day. what needs to be done to bring in more transparency and avoid this problem?, it is our belief that more complex and discretionary a system of taxation is, the more would be issues of malfeasance. we need to reduce human interfaces and discretionary powers in the hands of officials., technology is the way forward in governance, and, i believe, the industry can work very closely with the government to ensure that more transparent and simple administrative machineries are in place., which are the sectors you see contributing most to creating employment in the next few years?, it is apparent that while the share of agriculture in gdp has declined sharply, its share in employment remains at high levels. therefore, new employment has to be created outside agriculture, whether it is in industry or services., the data shows that between 2004-05 and 2009-10, the sector that created most jobs was construction. we will work towards spreading the job creation process across more sectors. reforms in labour laws are urgently required to facilitate industrial restructuring to help create employment. sectors such as textiles, capital goods and automobiles have great potential for generating more employment., going forward, what kind of growth do you see for the it industry?, over the medium to long-term, i am very optimistic about the industry’s growth because the use of it is only going to increase. this means that there are significant opportunities for new business creation, new products to be introduced, new use of technology and new business models.",0.16343250688705235,‘we need reduce discretionary powers hands officials ’,"s. gopalakrishnan , infosys co-founder executive co-chairman , s. gopalakrishnan , recently took charge president confederation indian industry ( cii ) . , recent conversation hindu , talks current business environment country , outlook $ 108-billionit-bpm ( business process management ) industry. , excerpts : , three biggest challenges facing economy right now?

2013-05-14,india’s defence needs fdi,"last friday, the ministry of defence took yet another step to signal that it is serious about turning around the pathetic state of india’s defence industry. it did so by requesting proposals from eight foreign vendors for 56 medium transport aircraft to replace the indian air force’s ageing fleet of hs 748 avros. what is striking about the deal is not its value of around rs 28,000 crore, but the fact that the ministry has deliberately kept the state-owned hindustan aeronautics ltd away from the competition. the deal involves off-the-shelf purchase of 16 aircraft with the balance to be made in a facility in india established by the foreign vendor and an indian private sector partner of its choice., private sector involvement, this is the first time in recent decades that the government has consciously chosen to open up a military industrial contract to the private sector and it comes hard on the heels of the ministry’s april 20 amendation to its defence procurement procedure (dpp). yet, these are only tiny steps in the right direction. what we need are giant strides that will ensure that the next cycle of modernisation too — it will begin roughly in the mid-2020s — is not based overwhelmingly on imports., “tweaking” procedures, as the mod is now doing, is not going to achieve this. it will take nothing less than a drastic makeover, involving a transformation of the management of the ministry, as well as dismantling some parts of the military-industrial setup, to make way for more efficacious alternatives., in the mid-1990s, a committee headed by a.p.j. abdul kalam said it would increase the indigenous content of weaponry from 30 to 70 per cent by 2005. but in 2013, we are still importing 70 per cent. we are manufacturing high-end products like the su 30 mki fighters, brahmos missiles and scorpene subs, but these are licence productions of foreign designed weapons, and even here we know that key assemblies will be imported till the very end of the programme., while other sectors of the manufacturing industry in the country, notably automobiles, have become world class sectors, the record of our government-run arms industry which employs 1.5 million people, remains one of failure and disappointment. in 1991, the arun singh committee on defence expenditure was the first to point out the obsolescence of the ordnance factories and recommended the shutting down of five and letting the private sector handle items like clothing. instead of shutting down, they are flourishing, including the premier vehicle factory jabalpur which simply assembles ashok leyland stallion and tata lpta 713 trucks., the performance of the ordnance factories and defence public sector units (dpsus) has been, to use a polite word, below par. according to a report of the boston consulting group, the annual output per employee in the ordnance factories and the dpsu is of the order of rs 15.4 lakh while the average across the manufacturing sector is rs 30.40 lakh. the parliamentary defence service estimates of 2012-13 show that despite this, rs 556 crore had been allotted for overtime pay in the ordnance factories’ budget., loot of the exchequer, just how we have short-changed our defence capabilities and allowed dpsus to loot the exchequer is brought out by two figures. one reveals that build times for indigenous warships are unconscionably long. the delhi class (6,500 tonnes) took 114 months to be built while equivalent ships take 29-30 months in the u.s. and japan. delhi, the first in its class, may have involved a learning curve, but sadly, the follow on mysore and mumbai also took 117 and 106 months. the shivalik class which were contracted for 60 months took 112 months., another metric emerges from the fact that indian-made sukhoi 30 mki costs rs 80 crore per unit more than those imported from russia. the fact we are tying up to design the fifth generation fighter with the russians indicates that there was little or no learning process involved in the indigenous manufacture of the su-30 by the hal., in the past one year, we have seen two other aspects of the problem. a cbi probe has shown how the management of the bharat earth movers ltd (beml) undermined the 1986 agreement with tatra of the erstwhile czechoslovakia for the supply of its t815 trucks. but instead of a projected 85 per cent indigenisation by 1991, we were left below 50 per cent in 2012., evidence suggests that our dpsu managers have actually been going out of their way to serve the interests of the foreign “partner,” rather than the psu they head. this is not a disease confined to beml alone; almost all dpsus suffer from it., the roots of this could well lie in that other problem which was revealed by the second major scandal, relating to the import of 12 vvip helicopters — corruption. the vvip helicopter deal suggested that not a single major defence purchase arrangement had escaped corruption, excluding, perhaps, the us fms arrangements., the formal thrust of the dpp has been incorporated in the “buy”, “buy and make” and “make” acquisition strategies. as outlined by the dpp 2011, “buy” would mean an outright purchase of equipment and could be “buy (indian)” or “buy” (global)’. “indian” would mean indian vendors only and “global” would mean foreign as well as indian vendors. “buy” indian’ must have minimum 30 per cent indigenous content if the systems are being integrated by an indian vendor., “buy & make” would mean purchase from a foreign vendor followed by licensed production/indigenous manufacture in the country. “buy & make (indian)” would mean purchase from an indian vendor including an indian company forming joint venture/establishing production arrangement with an original equipment manufacturer (oem) followed by licensed production in the country. “buy & make (indian)” must have minimum 50 per cent indigenous content on a cost basis., “make” would include high technology complex systems to be designed, developed and produced indigenously. note that the budget outlay for the “make” category which was rs 89 crore last year has been cut to just rs 1 crore in this year’s budget., an incentive, included in this is the policy of direct offsets of 30-50 per cent for any arms imports above a certain amount to promote the import of foreign technology. expectations that this will bring high-tech into the country have been belied. no country parts with its core high technology. but what we can do, by taking bold steps like permitting 100 per cent fdi in defence industry, is to incentivise them to set up plants in india. this way you can ensure that key technology will not be denied to you at a crucial time, and indian vendors would have the opportunity to get into the global supply chains of high-tech companies.",-0.023169580068314242,india ’ defence needs fdi,"last friday , ministry defence took yet another step

2013-05-28,defence production needs fdi,"vijay kumar saraswat, scientific advisor to the defence ministe , vijay kumar saraswat, scientific advisor to the defence minister, has been heading the defence research and development organisation (drdo) since september 2009. starting his career with drdo in 1972 with development of india’s first liquid propulsion engine, devil, he has devoted a lifetime in developing defence technologies. a doctorate in propulsion engineering from osmania university, he established facilities for design, production and testing of engines and relevant technologies for the missile applications., as project-director, he steered the design, development, production and induction of the first indigenous surface-to-surface missile system prithvi into the armed forces. he also oversaw the successful testing of missile on-board a moving ship with dhanush, with a very high terminal accuracy. under his stewardship, drdo has embarked on a challenging, futuristic air defence programme that involves development of complex anti-ballistic missile systems, radars and integration of battle management resources into a national authority. he has also conceptualised and established facilities for development of micro and nano sensors for future avionics., in this exclusive, freewheeling interview to the hindu, dr. saraswat provides an insight into manifold challenges which india faced while embarking on an ambitious defence research programme. he also speaks on various key issues like india’s indigenisation programme of defence production; need to raise the foreign direct investment (fdi) into defence sector, involvement of private sector, missile programme and how india is closing gaps in defence technology with china. here are, excerpts from the interview:, on drdo’s biggest criticism of failing to deliver in time, resulting in delays and time and cost overruns., to understand this issue, you will have to go back to history a bit, the time when drdo was set up in 1958 with practically no idea of what defence research will be. there was no defence technology at that time, drdo was created from a set of institutions which were set up by the british for doing quality assurance and to some extent reverse engineering of products which were manufactured in british ordnance factories and brought to indian ordnance factories for mass scale production. that was the scenario in which defence research started. our leaders like pandit jawaharlal nehru realised that overdependence on equipment which was of british origin or was left behind as part of commonwealth legacy was not adequate. they realised that there should be a push to defence research., it was under the leadership of d. s. kothari, the first scientific advisor, that a complete framework of defence research was set up. the vision of our own planners was very limited. they said that india needs only small things and not big things. so six or seven areas were identified which included missiles, material, electronic systems and so on. many of these were derivatives of technological institutions of britishers. obviously, they did not have any background of defence research. starting from that era, drdo started building technologies., fortunately there was this public sector set up of bharat electronics limited (bel) which had a collaboration with thalys of france. it helped in converting the research of drdo into production of mostly communication equipment for our armed forces., initially, it built some radars. our armed forces were being equipped by acquisition of equipment which was either british or russian because in late 50s and early 60s we had good equation with russians. indian equipment was in sporadic supply, in fact, it was hardly anything because we did not have any industry. tatas and birlas were into very mundane commercial production, tatas had set up their steel plant. inputs needed for manufacturing any goods were barely available in the country., in 1963, we started our first indigenous anti tank missile programme which started here and was later shifted later to hyderabad. in 1963-64, we started indigenous anti-tank missile programme. my predecessors had to assemble a nine volt dry cell to power the missile in the lab. the famous exide which was making automobile batteries was not in a position to do anything. there was no industry both in the country private and public sectors that could have helped drdo in doing anything., so, industry non-existent, technology base not there, academic institutions of excellence not present but individual excellence was available in giants like prof. kothari and dr. sarabhai. but large scale academic excellence which is needed for doing this kind of work was not there., era of 70s, between 1960-70, drdo started building technology and this was in radars, missiles, communication and materials area and to some extent electronic warfare. this is our own technology. there was another parallel push in drdo, we took up reverse engineering of available products which our armed forces were having at that time., one is own technology development, and then through reverse engineering. these two processes were on at the same time. until 70s the participation of indian private industry was practically non-existent. the only area where we were getting support was the growth of bel, hal and then in 1968-69 came in bharat dynamics limited (bdl) which was part of a project which drdo did although the project was shelved. there were 60 to 70 scientists who had soiled their hands in missile development and they were available to set up bdl. right from the general manager to technician were from drdo. it was in 70s when drdo really grew, major emphasis was placed by dr. nag chaudhary on missiles. while atomic energy department was working for first nuclear explosion which finally took place in 1974, that was also the time when present crop of people like us from iits, and indian institute of science came around. these institutions produced about a hundred engineers and they were inducted into the system to work on technology development., in the 1970-80 decade, drdo technology grew in all spheres. there were giants like prof. mgk menon and dr. raja ramanna who had become scientific advisers. i was responsible for manufacture of liquid rocket engine. the first indra one radar came in that period. prof. narain rao had built jammers and even at that time participation of industry was limited to public sector but drdo could not survive purely by interacting with only public sector. two private sector industries started working with drdo. there was this prof janardan rao who came from the u.s. and set up a small unit. when i was doing liquid rocket engine programme i needed electro pneumatic system for testing. under a shed in most abysmal condition, he was trying to do most sophisticated and advanced technology with whatever money he got from the u.s. he built the electro pneumatic system for me that enabled first liquid rocket engine testing possible. if it was not there, i would not have been able to test. like that there were hundreds of such scattered stories where we could trigger small and medium industries., at the same time, department of space and atomic energy were also having similar experiments. it was an era when a good number of medium and small scale industries came up. what handicap we faced in 60s of assembling our own dry cell had vanished and as a result of that some good products came, communication sets came, good radars also came. indra one radar was given to our armed forces. people thought it was a never ending process. time required was enormous; we did not have the advantage of the global eco system. india had missed the industrial revolution and it did not have an industrial background but had embarked upon an ambitious defence technology programme which at that time was ahead by leaps and bounds in foreign countries who were already flying missiles and aircraft and developing new technologies but india was only using systems imported from various countries., india also did not have the advantage of the licensed productions which were signed during 50s and 60s during the socialist pattern of governance in which large number of public sector units were set up. they could not contribute to technology development as all of them were licensed production agencies. they were continuously going from one licence to another. drdo, space and atomic energy none of them could benefit from licensed production culture which was prevalent in india. we had to do technology development by ourselves., 80s saw drdo graduating to weapons system, in 1980 when mrs indira gandhi returned to power, she said drdo has spent a lot of time now and the country had started asking the same questions which are being raised now. we had completed small programmes. mrs. gandhi said that time has come for you to consolidate. we had four technologies going on in drdo – surface to air missiles, new generation anti-tank missile and also as part of dr. nag chaudhary’s vision we were planning to do a long range ballistic missile that has led to development of propulsion technology in drdo. i fired 30 tonne liquid rocket engine in 1974 and it was all being developed and so when mrs. gandhi saw all this, she said it is time for you to graduate to weapons system., with her vision and induction of dr. arunachalam as scientific advisor and dr. abdul kalam as the director of drdo, she entrusted the task of building missiles for the country and that gave birth to igmdp --the integrated guided missile development programme (igmdp). it was not only given projects but it changed complete structure and system of working of drdo. when we analysed reasons for delay, one of the issues which came out was that we did not have the availability of large scale production of indigenously developed products. we were doing licensed production but we did not know how to produce in terms of quality and quantity the indigenously developed products., her vision reflected into a very potent management structure. igmdp’s three-tier management system – development, production and risk taking facility. she said production facilities of the country would be augmented and the programme was having the necessary funds and the risk taking capability that in case these projects failed this infrastructure would not be terminated. that vision led to the growth of hal, bel and bdl., in this long journey of developing our defence sector, you will see that delays took place due to non-availability of products. it was during mrs. gandhi’s time that our public sector developed risk taking capability and bdl, hal, bel took on production of igmdp systems., in 80s, we set up aerospace division of hal, it was set up when i was doing the prithvi programme. we also first developed the airframe of prithvi missile and the division was set up at a cost of rs. 46 crore. at that time isro was setting up pslv integration programme, so we joined hands and this led to upgradation of production, capacity to take risks and also monitoring and management of variety of institutions in the country was set in., decision makers at that point in time asked me why delays were taking place. i said that maximum delay took place in procuring the materials and equipment for doing the product and which is 40 per cent of the time of the production cycle. the then expenditure secretary mr. ganpati said that you should not follow the typical process of getting quotations and he said that when you deal with public sector units all your contracts should be on the cost plus basis whether it is bdl, bel or hal. he fixed that 12 per cent will be profit and said that hal cannot take more than that. in today’s parlance, i cannot even think that something like this will happen and igmdp worked on this pattern and this aggressive decision making enabled a good ecosystem for r & d and which got converted into production., on prithvi and agni missiles, we were to develop prithvi missile’s one version in seven years but we developed three versions in 15 years – first of 150 km range, second of 250 km and the third naval version of 350 km range when fired from the ship, yes we took 15 years but we developed the complete system. same thing happened in agni one, two three programme. but still time and cost overruns were there because when igmdp was planned we had planned to import some material. we had to import some materials for prithvi which was first fired in 1988 and agni in 1989 and then mtcr (missile technology control regime) which was brewing all this time clamped all restrictions on us. all the contracts which we had signed with all companies were not honoured and these companies took back everything. everything was denied to us, this denial caused us a lot of delay and whatever we needed had to be designed, developed and produced by us., from 1989 to 1997 was a harrowing period. there were restrictions imposed on india and for things like getting magnesium supply and servo valves for launch vehicles, we had to struggle and later produce our very own. at that time, tamil nadu government’s tidco helped in making magnesium slab from ore. though technical problems had been solved by first launches of prithvi and agni missiles. now these problems are not there, today, india produces its own servo valves not only for missiles but also for launch vehicles and many other industrial purposes. what was a critical technology in 1988 is no more critical, new technologies have come. a lot of liberalisation has taken place but the fact still remains that critical technologies which are required are not available to us. for example, we still do not have access to high end computer processors and we have to make do with intel core system. i cannot get a high end computer and i have to start building it for my missile right from the chip., on delays in development and production of arjun main battle tank and light combat aircraft (lca), nearly three decades ago, arjun tank project was started and after that we started work on light combat aircraft (lca). these got delayed mainly due to denial of several technologies to us and lack of industrial support. we have done lca-lca mk.1 which is going to be produced. we are doing lca-mk.2 and also doing lcanavy. lca navy will be able to take off and land on deck of a ship. we are building all facilities for a short lift, short take off, short landing, all that we are doing. arjun mark 2, we have made 66 modifications in three years. first set of trials are over last summer, second set of trials are going to be held this year. we have demonstrated missile firing capability just about a month and a half back., lca mk 2 is now a reality on the drawing board because we are in a position to get industrial support and academic support so these delays which used to happen earlier, the causes have been removed, the eco system is much more friendly than ever before. experience of doing large scale products has also come to us which was not there in 60s and 70s., on indigenisation, where india stands today? increase in fdi limit., today, drdo has groomed 400 industries and has their support. we have galloped in electronics. semi-conductor technology and high end computing chips were denied to us by the west but we have gone ahead and we are putting up a state-of-the art foundry for manufacturing semi-conductors., today if i want a rocket motor i can go to godrej or walchandnagar or to bdl. today if i want a computer i can go to private industries and hundreds of them are available. i can give specification of a launcher to at least ten industries in this country who can manufacture one. if i want a system integration, my public sector units can do that whether it is hal, bdl or bel, they can do overall lead system integration. still there are gaps and these gaps are continuously increasing because in areas of electronics technology has galloped. what was 8086 computer of prithivi with 64 kb memory is now into gigabytes of memory. so, we had missed that completely, our semiconductor technology is lagging behind. at least r & d should have gone into it but we were denied all semiconductor equipment and machinery from the west., new area of photonic system has come. if i have close tie ups with international community in these areas the pace with which this gap has to be filled will never be achieved. so we have to get tie ups with extremely high investments. a good foundry will cost two to three billion dollars, we need to have it. in my view, joint ventures (jv) and stress on indigenisation is the core of our strategy to move forward. but jv cannot come up with the limitation of fdi. if you want to get really good technology, it will not come with 26 per cent. it should be raised to 48 to 49 per cent so that we can get required good technology. but there are fears in the minds of people if we allow more than that the process of indigenisation will suffer, i can say that indigenisation will not suffer because indian r&d is not so weak today that it cannot compete with the r&d in the world., in the last 10 to 15 years i have worked in international collaboration with russia, france, israel, and i can only say that indian r&d institutions and scientists are matching one to one with respect to best of their capabilities to contributing to jv or absorbing from there the right technology. this is not going to be teacher and taught relationship. this is going to be a relationship at par. our research base and eco systems are strong enough to grow further with these partnerships., we learnt how to do professional management of development of large systems using multiple agencies and bringing all of them in terms of time, technology coherence and in terms of joint motivation to achieve the goal has been learnt by this organisation. and this is unique feature of three departments -- drdo, isro and atomic energy., these are the only three departments who are in a position to do this kind of large system, development which you will see still lacking in other departments., on china and how india is closing gaps in technology; private sector should not remain only a component manufacturer, only gap which exists between china and india today is in terms of large scale manufacturing capability. as far as technology is concerned, i can only say in defence we have come very close to china. take missiles, our reach and accuracy is comparable. today we have no problem., our lca today is a shining example of comparably what china is producing in j-10. our lca is today fourth generation plus aircraft. but our manufacturing capabilities in numbers are certainly lacking and that is where gap has to be caught up. that is where private sector participation and a trustworthy platform and ecosystem which will bring private sector as an agency that is as competent, as good, as patriotic and as nationalistic should be considered. that ecosystem should be provided to private sector to come in whether it is shipbuilding, missile building, torpedo building or submarine building. we should not allow private sector to remain a component manufacturer. we should let them graduate from sub system manufacturer. private sector should graduate to a lead system integrator and then certainly we can catch up with china in no time., on future missile programme, in the area of long range missiles, our programmes are well defined. we are doing technologies which will be integrated with agni v and then we are also trying to see the ballistic missiles of different ranges in different roles. we have already been strategic roles but there are tactical roles of ballistic missiles emerging. war is not going to be just across our boundaries, it will be in far off places and across continents. so what we are looking today how to make sure that ballistic missile reach precisely like china has done today anti-ship ballistic missile, we have plans to convert some of our ballistic missiles to take on pinpoint mobile targets., ballistic missile defence is our priority area which we are augmenting in a big way. going from our interception capability of 80 kms to 300 kms, we are also having the capability to take care in a limited manner of sudden large number of missiles fired.",0.11974104448008832,defence production needs fdi,"vijay kumar saraswat , scientific advisor defence ministe , vijay kumar saraswat , scientific advisor defence minister , heading

2013-05-29,defence production needs fdi,"v.k. saraswat: ‘we now have the experience of doing large-scale projects, which we did not have in the 1960s and the 1970s.’ | photo credit: k_murali_kumar , vijay kumar saraswat, scientific advisor to the defence minister, has headed the defence research and development organisation (drdo) since september 2009. starting his career with drdo in 1972, with the development of india’s first liquid propulsion engine, devil, he has devoted a lifetime to developing defence technologies., in this exclusive interview, dr. saraswat, whose four-year term as sa and drdo director general ends on may 31, talks to vinay kumar about the early challenges india faced in its defence research programme, its indigenisation, foreign direct investment (fdi), and how the gap with china is being closed in defence technology. excerpts:, on the biggest criticism against drdo — failing to deliver on time — and the resultant delay and cost overrun., to understand this issue, you have to go back into history a bit, to the time when drdo was set up in 1958 with practically no idea of what defence research was., when we started our first indigenous anti-tank missile programme in 1963, there was no industry in the country — private or public sector — that could have helped drdo, no technology base or academic institutions of excellence. there was individual excellence in giants like prof. kothari and dr. sarabhai. but large-scale academic excellence needed for doing this kind of work was not there., between 1960-70, drdo started building technology in radars, missiles, communication and materials area and, to some extent, electronic warfare. there was another parallel push in drdo: we took up reverse engineering of products that our armed forces had at that time., until the 1970s, indian private industry participation was practically non-existent. the only area where we were getting support was in the growth of bel bharat electronics limited, hal hindustan aeronautics limited. then came bharat dynamics limited (bdl). it was in the 1970s that drdo really grew., in 1980, when mrs indira gandhi returned to power, she said drdo should graduate to weapons system. it was her vision that led to inception of the integrated guided missile development programme (igmdp). it changed the complete structure and system of working at drdo., on the prithvi and agni missiles, we were to develop one version of prithvi in seven years but we developed three versions in 15 years. same thing happened with the agni one, two and three programmes. still, there were time and cost overruns because … we had to import some materials for prithvi which was first fired in 1988 and agni in 1989, and then mtcr (missile technology control regime) … clamped restrictions on us. the contracts we had signed with companies were not honoured, and these companies took back everything. everything was denied to us. this denial caused us a lot of delay and whatever we needed had to be designed, developed and produced by us., on delays in the development and production of the arjun main battle tank and light combat aircraft (lca), nearly three decades ago, the arjun tank project was started and after that we started work on the light combat aircraft (lca). these got delayed mainly due to denial of several technologies to us and lack of industrial support. we have done lca-mk.1 which is going to be produced. we are doing lca-mk.2 and also doing lca-navy which will be able to take off from and land on the deck of a ship., take arjun mark 2: we have made 66 modifications in three years. the first set of trials was over last summer, second set of trials is going to be held this year. we have demonstrated missile firing capability just a month-and-a-half back. lca-mk.2 is now a reality on the drawing board because we are in a position to get industrial and academic support so these delays which used to happen earlier, the causes have been removed. we also now have the experience of doing large-scale projects, which we did not have in the 1960s and 1970s., on indigenisation and increase in fdi limit, today, drdo has groomed 400 industries and has their support. we have galloped ahead in electronics. semiconductor technology and high end computing chips were denied to us by the west but we have gone ahead and we are putting up a state-of-the art foundry for manufacturing semiconductors., today, if i want a rocket motor or computer, i can go to private industries. if i want a system integration, my public sector units can do that whether it is hal, bdl or bel, they can do overall lead system integration., still there are gaps and these are continuously increasing … so we have to tie-up with the international community with extremely high investments., in my view, joint ventures (jv) and stress on indigenisation is the core of our strategy to move forward. but jv cannot come up with limitations on fdi. if you want to get really good technology, it will not come with 26 per cent. it should be raised to 48 to 49 per cent so that we can get the required good technology. but there are fears that if we allow more, the process of indigenisation will suffer. i can say that it will not. indian r&d is not so weak today that it cannot compete with the r&d in the world., in the last 10 to 15 years i have worked in international collaborations with russia, france, israel, and i can say that indian r&d institutions and scientists are second to none with respect to their capabilities, in contributing to a jv or absorbing from there the right technology. this is not going to be teacher and taught relationship. this is going to be a relationship at par. our research base and eco systems are strong enough to grow further with these partnerships., on china and how india is closing the gaps in technology and how the private sector should not remain only a component manufacturer, the only gap which exists between china and india today is in terms of large-scale manufacturing capability. as far as technology is concerned, i can only say in defence we have come very close to china. take missiles, our reach and accuracy is comparable., our lca today is a shining example, comparable to what china is producing in j-10. but our manufacturing capabilities in numbers are certainly lacking and that is where the gap has to be caught up. that is where private sector participation should be considered. an ecosystem should be provided to private sector to come in whether it is shipbuilding, missile building, torpedo building or submarine building. we should not allow private sector to remain a component manufacturer. private sector should graduate to a lead system integrator and then certainly we can catch up with china in no time., on future missile programmes, in the area of long-range missiles, our programmes are well defined. we are doing technologies that will be integrated with agni v; we are also trying to look at ballistic missiles of different ranges in different roles. war is not going to be just across our boundaries, it will be in far-off places and across continents. so what we are looking at today is how to make sure that ballistic missiles reach their targets precisely., ballistic missile defence is our priority area which we are augmenting in a big way. going from our interception capability of 80 km to 300 km, we also have the capability to take care in a limited manner of a sudden large number of missiles fired. of course, there is no answer to infinite missiles. if somebody is launching 24 missiles at the same time, we should be able to handle it. our emphasis is on missile development programme and going for cruise missiles, like you saw the launch of ‘nirbhay’ last time. we have to perfect that system.",0.09055647840531564,defence production needs fdi,"v.k. saraswat : ‘we experience large-scale projects , 1960s 1970s. ’ &#124; photo credit :

subsidiary of textron inc. it manufactures fixed-wing aircraft as well as helicopters and uavs. founded in 1923, textron has grown into a network of businesses with total revenues of $12.2 billion and approximately 32,000 employees with facilities and presence in 25 countries. in an interview to the hindu during his recent visit to india, frank t. connor, executive vice-president and chief financial officer of textron inc, talks about the company’s plans in india and bats for foreign direct investment (fdi) in the defence sector. an excerpt from the interview:, what are your views on the indian commercial helicopter market? what sectors are you targeting?, it’s not very encouraging at the moment. the numbers are declining with not enough infrastructural support available in india. lack of helipads, trained pilots and a slow economy are affecting the market. most airports in india are made for fixed-wing aircraft and trained commercial pilots are usually attracted by the airlines. also, the helicopter market is still evolving. we are waiting for the demand for state police, medical evacuation and reconnaissance helicopters becoming a reality. we are also targeting state governments, ongc, oil and gas exploration companies, pawan hans, corporate houses and pilgrimage tourism., there is a strong support for increasing fdi in the defence sector both at home and abroad. how do you see the situation unfurling in this matter?, increasing fdi in the defence sector from the present 26 per cent will be a welcome move. we are here to partner with indian companies looking for strategic partnerships, joint ventures, etc. from our perspective, if we are sharing technology, we would like to have higher equity than 26 per cent. it is only going to help the indian industry in indigenisation and modernisation because the foreign original equipment manufacturers (oems) will be able to share high-end technology and ready to invest in indian companies., how do you perceive defence investment by foreign companies in india given the fact that often uncertainties block the deal, the latest being finmeccanica’s agustawestland vvip choppers?, i would not like to comment on finmeccanica but i would like to say from the perspective of the u.s. and textron that we are here basically for a long term strategic partnership and participate in all indian defence modernisation programmes., what it the status of the sensor fuzed weapon (sfw) programme for the jaguar aircraft?, the integration work has already started at hal. in late 2012, the indian air force began receiving deliveries of textron defense systems’ sfw for the jaguar aircraft. the sfw foreign military sale programme was initiated in 2010. we are under contract to provide a total of 512 sfws. it is a smart air-to-ground area weapon designed to defeat moving and fixed targets on land and at sea. with proven features to prevent hazardous unexploded ordnance, the sfw delivers greater than 99 per cent reliability, verified through operational performance., for the bell helicopter, is there any ongoing discussion with the indian navy?, yes, we are in discussion with the indian navy but nothing is final till now. we have various products, which can be offered to indian armed forces depending on the requirement. for example, the 407 armed version, the 429 latest twin engine, the ah-1z zulu, the v 22 osprey and the bell 525 relentless (which is currently under production)., could you elaborate on what textron is looking from the indian crime and criminal tracking network and system (cctns) programme?, we are in touch with the paramilitary forces for uav and unattended ground sensor solutions on it security. we have a number of modules for all types of requirements. we are looking for partnerships with the state police departments and other agencies for upcoming programs related to homeland security. cctns is the programme where all the police stations of india will be connected for tracking crimes and criminals., what are the areas you are looking at for sourcing from india?, india is a major sourcing partner for us. we are currently producing the body of one of the bell helicopters with an indian private industry. we source some parts for our piston engine company called lycoming, which are critical parts and are cleared by federal aviation administration (faa). currently, we are looking at sourcing bell helicopter cabin assembly in significant numbers from india. additionally, a programme is on to source some air borne weapon components. we have 525 people in our technology centre in bangalore, which is the largest technology centre outside north america., in your view, what policy initiatives should the government take to strengthen the

2013-07-01,"of reliance, by reliance, for reliance","hans christian andersen’s story about the emperor’s new clothes came to mind as i read the finance minister’s justification of the totally indefensible hike in india’s wellhead price for dry natural gas. the absence of any evidence-based research backing key economic decisions is the true “economic reality” of india, which is today the only country in the world that sees no difference between the wellhead price of natural gas and the price of liquefied natural gas (lng)., the core argument being presented is that the higher price will yield higher upstream investment in untapped hydrocarbon frontiers, resulting in higher output of domestic natural gas and the reduction or even elimination of india’s import dependence on even costlier lng, thereby improving the country’s fiscal stability and energy security., unfortunately this argument is fallacious on several counts., decline in output, first, the government itself admits that despite raising the domestic wellhead price of natural gas by almost 300 per cent from as low as $1.79/mmbtu to as high as $5.25/mmbtu, investments in the sector and the country’s gas output have actually dropped. the bulk of this drop is because of reliance industries ltd (ril), the company whose demands triggered the recent price increase. the comptroller and auditor general report explicitly outlines how ril reneged on its production commitments while gold-plating its investments. can the government guarantee that a price of $8.4/mmbtu will raise gas availability?, what if history repeats itself and it does not? will the government then find more ways to raise prices even further? how long will the government wait to do so? does it have a long-term vision based on geopolitical developments in the energy sector, especially gas, where canada and the u.s. are poised to become major lng exporters?, significantly, the single largest instance of foreign direct investment that the above cited 300 per cent price increase attracted was bp’s acquisition of a 30 per cent stake in ril’s declining kg basin play and not in any new greenfield frontier. bp is not known to invest $7 billion-plus for improving a country’s fiscal or energy balance. the company must have seen returns from a known discovery even at the then approved price of $4.2/mmbtu., second, the import parity price for a globally traded commodity such as crude oil (unlike natural gas) that has justifiably been in place since the 1990s has not succeeded in raising domestic crude production significantly or attracted significant fdi in the indian sedimentary basin. here too, the single largest investment was the purchase of a foreign company’s stake in an existing on-shore field in rajasthan., finally, and most importantly, even if the government is right; what is the justification for raising the price of gas from existing fields? we can always pay a higher price for more difficult horizons provided the duly approved and audited costs of exploration and production warrant that. the current production was realised with no prospect of getting $8.4/mmbtu. will the government spell out its plan for this windfall profit it is bequeathing to current producers at the cost of the common man and honest taxpayers?, it has been argued that the bulk of the benefits from the price hike will go to the public sector. however, we all know that the upstream public sector companies are milked by the government through ad hoc burdens such as funding under-recoveries. hence, the real beneficiaries will be private gas producers unless the government also announces policies that place the same burdens on upstream private and public sector companies. but that would defeat the real purpose of the price increase, wouldn’t it? a bogey used to milk the upstream public sector is the absence of profit-sharing in the nomination blocks that they received in the pre-nelp era. it would be educational for me and others if the government would make public the exact amount of profit gas and profit oil that it has received from private producers since the new exploration licensing policy was instituted., in any event, the entire fairy tale of fiscal stability has now been undermined by none other than the finance minister himself. in his press briefing on friday, he opened the door for subsidising the purchase of gas for the power and fertilizer sectors that together use over 75 per cent of the available gas in india., cheating & double-cheating, like the $4.20/mmbtu price the last time, i am intrigued by the choice of the number $8.40/mmbtu this time around. in everyday language, these numbers are used to signify cheating and double-cheating! the price of 4.20 was derived based on a ril formula that had never been used and is still not used anywhere in the world to price natural gas at the wellhead or any other form of gas anywhere. the 8.40 number reportedly flows from the rangarajan formula, which again is not used anywhere else in the world to establish the wellhead price of natural gas or any other form of gas anywhere., can the government identify even a single gas field in the world that gets a well head price of $8.40/mmbtu for conventional dry natural gas? how come investments keep taking place elsewhere without resorting to such dubious pricing formulae? can dr. rangarajan identify which element in his formula represents the wellhead price for dry natural gas actually received by conventional natural gas producers around the world? the truth is that none of the elements in the rangarajan formula represents the wellhead price it sets out to establish, and yet it magically delivers a price at exactly twice the 4.20 level! the henry hub spot price (currently at $3.77/mmbtu), which is the only relevant element in the rangarajan formula, is also greater than the wellhead price received by producers of conventional dry natural gas in the u.s., ‘gigantic scam’, strong words are typically not in my vocabulary so let me simply say that i agree with gurudas dasgupta, mp, that a “gigantic scam” is being perpetrated on the impoverished people of our country.",0.06353655603655603,"reliance , reliance , reliance","hans christian andersen ’ story emperor ’ new clothes came mind read finance minister ’ justification totally indefensible hike india ’ wellhead price dry natural gas. absence evidence-based research backing key economic decisions true “economic reality ” india , today country world sees difference wellhead price natural gas price liquefied natural gas ( lng ) . , core argument presented higher price yield higher upstream investment untapped hydrocarbon frontiers , resulting higher output domestic natural gas reduction even elimination india ’ import dependence even costlier lng , thereby improving country ’ fiscal stability energy security. , unfortunately argument fallacious several counts. , decline output , first , government admits despite raising domestic wellhead price natural gas almost 300 per cent low $ 1.79/mmbtu high $ 5.25/mmbtu , investments sector country ’ gas output actually dropped. bulk drop reliance industries ltd ( ril ) , company whose demands triggered recent price increase. comptroller auditor general report explicitly outlines ril reneged production commitments gold-plating investments. government guarantee price $ 8.4/mmbtu raise gas availability?

2013-07-03,a climate plan that changes nothing,"last week, united states president barack obama laid out his administration’s first blueprint on the domestic and international initiatives it will pursue to tackle climate change. as with most speeches of the obama presidency, this too was based on the catchy rhetoric of humanism, but driven by the narrative of instrumentalism. this style-over-substance approach to climate change, intended primarily for a u.s.-based audience — and by initial reaction, well-received across the board — would have been palatable had it not been for the troubling implications it holds for both multilateral climate change negotiations and the economic policies of developing countries, india in particular. mr. obama’s speech effectively allows developed countries to abandon their end of the equity bargain — i.e. to provide technology transfer and financial support to developing and least developed countries (ldcs) — in return for their promise of sustainable growth. the discourse has now turned to market-oriented approaches to foreign investment and de-regulation that emerging economies must welcome to “green” their development, if they want to be seen as responsible stakeholders., hollow commitment, mr. obama’s line has its genesis in the united states’s promise, made right before the 2009 copenhagen climate conference, to reduce carbon emissions to 17 per cent below 2005 levels by 2020, 42 per cent by 2030 and 83 per cent by 2050. despite talk of elevating climate change to a “legacy” issue for the president, the last two timelines have been conveniently omitted. his commitment to reaffirm the 2020 deadline is a hollow one — by most estimates, an emissions reduction of 17 per cent from 2005 levels is equivalent to a 4-6 per cent reduction from levels that persisted in 1990. on the other hand, the kyoto protocol, which the u.s. has not ratified, requires industrialised countries to reduce, by 2020, their greenhouse gas emissions by 18 per cent below 1990 levels. here’s the catch: u.s. emissions had already neared 1990 levels last year, thanks to the country’s ongoing shale gas revolution. put two and two together, what president obama promised this week is merely a 6 per cent reduction in u.s. emissions from current levels., the proposal to regulate carbon emissions from power plants (that run on conventional fossil fuel) has been billed as another crown jewel in mr. obama’s speech. first, these, if at all formulated, will be federal limits imposed by the u.s. environmental protection agency. each state in the u.s. is free to ‘opt out’ from their implementation; some no doubt will, given enormous pressure from their coal and steel lobbies. second, as jennifer dlouhy observes at the fuelfix blog, regulations on power plants will not automatically extend to oil refineries. apart from asking the u.s. congress to reduce tax incentives for big oil — certain not to ruffle their account books — mr. obama is deafeningly silent on the industry’s responsibility towards the environment. third, regulations imposed on coal-based power plants coincide with a greater reliance on shale gas in the u.s. shale gas use would lead to lower carbon emissions, but only if it is regulated. this is currently not the case: the u.k. based tyndall centre for climate research, for instance, argues that “without a meaningful cap on global carbon emissions, the exploitation of shale gas reserves is likely to increase total emissions.” if president obama has shut the gate on coal usage, he has in effect left the back door wide open for energy-intensive industries to operate without effecting systemic changes in their consumption., while mr. obama has announced a number of tepid measures that will somehow kickstart green growth in the u.s., his administration has been engaged in an unprecedented proselytising mission in emerging markets, preaching the need to reduce emissions. to gather support for its current approach, washington has gone on a diplomatic overdrive with china, japan, india and other major emitters. ahead of the recently concluded u.s.-india strategic dialogue in new delhi, secretary of state john kerry warned india “to heed mother nature’s warnings”, in a pointed reference to the devastating floods in uttarakhand. his thrust was simple: encourage “innovation” and “investment” in clean energy technology to reduce reliance on fossil fuels. these buzzwords have now been institutionalised through the setting up of a u.s.-india working group on climate change., if the u.s. government has done little by itself to confront the imminent dangers of climate change, why is it aggressively pushing the case for non-conventional and renewable sources of energy in emerging markets? shifting the spotlight away from immediate carbon cuts to long-term solutions like “clean energy” provides the west with a legal-moral basis to ask developing countries to further open up their economies, with sufficient latitude to make the transition itself. in fact, the success of the u.s. clean energy sector is contingent on how well american companies perform in lucrative markets like india., powerful carrot, the renewable energy sector in india alone is worth billions of dollars, if the forecasts of global consulting firms are to be believed. high financing costs, stringent government regulations and widespread public scepticism on the efficacy of solar and wind power have stunted the growth of the indian domestic sector. for american ‘green companies’ armed with subsidies and tax breaks, dominating this market will be a walk in the park. all they need to do is to hope that the indian government continues its foot-dragging renewable energy policy — one that currently permits 100 per cent fdi with little regulatory guidance — while pressing for tougher intellectual property laws bilaterally, in line with the ‘trips-plus’ vision. new delhi has thus far held out on restrictive ip laws, but faced with the threat of harsher immigration rules and limits on indian exports, concessions on this front may be a matter of time. moreover, the u.s. has a powerful carrot in the form of shale gas exports, which india has eyed keenly.",0.07961295995670994,climate plan changes nothing,"last week , united states president barack obama laid administration ’

2013-07-07,"new regime, multiple challenges","the securities and exchange board of india (sebi) in december 2012 had set up a committee to suggest measures for rationalisation of foreign portfolio investments in india., the foreign portfolio investments consist of investments in indian listed securities by foreign institutional investors (fiis), sub-accounts of such fiis, non-resident indians (nris) and qualified foreign investors (qfis)., the committee, under the chairmanship of former cabinet secretary k. m chandrasekhar submitted its report to sebi on june 12, which endorsed the 2013 budget proposals for uniform registration and other liberalised investment norms for foreign portfolio investors. sebi, in its recent meeting on june 25, has accepted the committee’s recommendations, which are likely to be implemented soon., the key recommendations, which have been accepted by sebi, are summarised as follows:, entry norms, first, uniform entry norms for foreign investors such as fiis, sub accounts and qfis (excluding nris), by merging them into a new investor class termed as ‘foreign portfolio investors’ (fpis)., second doing away with prior sebi registration for fii/sub-accounts and instead register them as fpi with a sebi authorised designated depository participant (ddp)., third, a risk-based approach to be adopted while conducting know your client (kyc) and registering the fpis with ddps., to achieve this, the fpis would be divided in to three categories., category i will consist of government entities such as sovereign wealth funds, foreign central banks. category ii will consist of regulated entities such as banks, investment managers, broad-based funds etc and category iii would be the residual category., the kyc norms for category i would be simplest and most stringent for category iii., fourth, foreign portfolio investments would mean investments by any investor or investor group up to 10 per cent of the equity of an indian company., proposals look promising, investments beyond 10 per cent would be considered as foreign direct investment (fdi). , he proposals (on the face of it) look promising for foreign investors and indian markets. however, on a finer analysis one would find certain issues and concerns which may arise while implementing the recommendations., some of them are discussed below:, first, doing away with sebi registration for fii/sub-accounts and mandating them to be registered with ddps is essentially a delegation without significantly diluting the registration requirements., rigorous processes, to draw inference, rigorous processes are applicable on qfis for opening account with qualified depository participants (qdps). qdps are also entrusted with the responsibility to follow the applicable domestic laws of the qfis., such similar norms would be applicable on ddps and in fact additional qualifications to register as a ddp (compared to qdp registration) with sebi have been proposed. for instance, a ddp is proposed to have a custodian licence, should be an authorised dealer category i bank, have a multinational presence etc., such rigorous requirements were not prescribed for qdps under qfi regime, as a result of which many of the existing qdps would not qualify as a ddp., a one year grace period for qdps to qualify as ddps has been recommended, but may not be sufficient., transition, second, it needs to be seen that how the transition happens for already registered fiis, sub-accounts and qfis. will they continue to be governed by the old norms or new procedures would be prescribed for them to migrate, needs to be seen. amendments (and where applicable, repeals) would be required in sebi laws, foreign exchange management laws, fdi regime and it will be a tedious process., third, an investment limit of 10 per cent of paid-up equity capital of an indian company has been prescribed per fpi entity., ownership of more than 50 per cent in two or more fpis for common beneficial owners will result in shareholding of such fpis to be clubbed in order to compute the 10 per cent investment limit. 50 per cent seems to be on the higher side as the same may allow the offshore investors to structure their investments in a manner which may indirectly and in spirit violate the sanctity of the 10 per cent investment limit., sebi and rbi may need to consider some alternative computation methodology in this regard., participatory notes, fourth, it is proposed that fpis under category i and ii can issue participatory-notes. the category ii also consists of broad-based funds. many such funds typically register as sub-accounts under the sebi fii regime., sub-accounts were prohibited by sebi from issuing p-notes in 2007. sebi therefore needs to be more

2013-07-16,‘we must explore option of nri bonds’,"c. rangarajan: ‘we cannot sacrifice environmental issues but at the same time growth is important. we need to work out a suitable compromise between compulsions of growth and concerns for the environment.’ | photo credit: r_v_moorthy , chairman of the prime minister’s economic advisory council dr. c. rangarajan tells m.k. venu that india could explore an nri bond issue of the kind done in 1998 after the asian financial crisis, to meet the potential shortfall in capital flows in the short run. however, the high current account deficit will have to be addressed in the medium to long term. excerpts:, you said after the union budget presentation in end-february that the economy can quickly come back to about 6.5 per cent growth if big investments, already in the pipeline, are pushed in railways, roads, ports and coal mining and power sectors. are we anywhere near realising that objective?, there are no definite signs that private investment has picked up. recent data on industrial production and more particularly on capital goods seem to confirm this. however, according to the latest data on national income, even in 2012-13, the gross fixed capital formation rate was 30 per cent of gdp. this, under normal circumstances, should have given us a growth rate of 7 to 7.5 per cent but the actual growth rate turned out to be five per cent. the rise in the incremental capital output ratio may be because projects have not been completed in time or complementary investments have not been forthcoming. in some cases, this can also be due to non-availability of critical inputs such as coal and power. the high level of the current investment rate gives us hope that if we take actions to speedily complete the projects, we can get a higher growth rate even in the short term. the cabinet committee on investments will help., focussed attention is being given to achieving the production and capacity creation targets in coal, power, road and railways. frequent meetings are being held to overcome the obstacles and constraints. in my view, the public sector will act as the driver of economic growth which will also act as a stimulant to private economic activities. taking all factors into account, the growth rate will be higher than last year, perhaps, at around six per cent., on completion of projects, i must also mention that in the most recent period, environmental and land acquisition concerns have very much come to the forefront. setting up of every power plant is facing difficulties. the nuclear power plant in tamil nadu has remained idle after having made an investment of more than a few thousand crores of rupees. over the medium term, we need to resolve these issues if we have to sustain high growth. we cannot sacrifice environmental issues but at the same time growth is important. we need to work out a suitable compromise between compulsions of growth and concerns for the environment., you have said an otherwise manageable cad now looks vulnerable with the u.s. federal reserve hinting at a tightening of its easy money policy of the last four years due to improvement in u.s. job market conditions. how do you see the next six months in this context?, the remarks relating to the tapering of quantitative easing (qe) in the u.s. have had a sharp impact on the markets. in many ways, it was an over-reaction. we have a high current account deficit and in the short run, we need capital flows to cover this deficit. we require a short term as well as a medium-term strategy to overcome the problems. in the immediate short term, we should explore all avenues to increase capital flows. over the medium term, we must bring down the current account deficit to more manageable levels. in fact, we should start doing this right away. while the u.s. economy has shown improvement which is good over the medium term for all countries, it has still a long way to go. i do not see qe tapering in the next six months. i expect capital flows to resume soon., going forward, will capital flows get disrupted in the backdrop of the u.s. monetary stance? all emerging economies are feeling the heat. india has $172 billion of external debt to be paid by march 2014. is that a source of worry given the prospect of liquidity withdrawal at the global level?, there was a big capital outflow in the month of june 2013. fiis withdrew almost u.s.$7.5 billion as against the inflow of u.s.$5.2 billion in may 2013. this is a turn around of u.s.$12.7 billion. besides the current account deficit, we also need to take care of other obligations such as the repayment of debt. as i mentioned earlier, i expect capital flows to resume shortly. relative to most other countries, india’s growth rate is still high. this should be an attractive factor for investors., what strategies can india adopt to insulate itself from the disruption that may be caused by the global finance capital play?, as far as capital flows are concerned, we have seen the worst. federal reserve has clarified that there are no immediate possibilities of qe tapering. in the short run, we should raise more funds. in the past, we have raised foreign exchange through the issue of nri bonds. this is an option we must explore. we must, however, choose the right time. over the next few years, we must reduce the current account deficit so that our dependency on capital flows is reduced., you mean the kind of nri bonds issue after the 1998 asian financial crisis?, yes, something similar to that. however, we need to overcome some regulatory concerns at the u.s. end for making such a bond issue today., the government has recently announced several measures to encourage capital inflows. are they working?, the measures announced to encourage capital inflows are appropriate. these measures are mainly focused on increasing the flows under fdi as well as fii portfolio investment. they will have a much bigger impact after the current phase of reaction to the fed statement fades away.",0.09493748128182093,‘we must explore option nri bonds ’,"c. rangarajan : ‘we cannot sacrifice environmental issues time growth important. need work suitable compromise compulsions growth concerns environment. ’ &#124; photo credit : r_v_moorthy , chairman prime minister ’ economic advisory council dr. c. rangarajan tells m.k. venu india could explore nri bond issue kind done 1998 asian financial crisis , meet potential shortfall capital flows short run. however , high current account deficit addressed medium long term. excerpts : , said union budget presentation end-february economy quickly come back 6.5 per cent growth big investments , already pipeline , pushed railways , roads , ports coal mining power sectors. anywhere near realising objective?

mr. jaitley was addressing party workers in chandigarh on sunday., speaking on the graft cases, he said, “with 2g, coal scam, bofors scam running into several lakhs of crores, corruption during the upa government has taken a form of small scale industry.”, mr. jaitley also attacked the centre over cbi, alleging that congress has been “misusing” the agency to not only save its ministers and other congressmen but also to keep itself in power., “every time congress government needed numbers for survival, the cbi suddenly went soft on the sp and bsp leaders who are facing probe for disproportionate assets., “they have even attacked ib for vote bank politics, however congress should remember cbi does not gets votes it is the people who vote and the mood of the people is clearly

2013-07-21,eleventh hour pinch-hitting,"the gdp grew by 5 per cent in 2012-13, a decade low number. | photo credit: aijaz rahi , ith the manmohan singh-led upa (united progressive alliance) government set to end its second innings next year, things have suddenly turned hectic. in a late evening action on tuesday last, the government relaxed significantly the norms for foreign direct investment (fdi) in several areas, including the critical defence sector., in his address at the annual meeting of the associated chambers of commerce and industry of india (assocham) on friday last, prime minister manmohan singh hinted at further reforms on the fdi front. ironically, even as he was announcing >fdi reforms, posco and arcelormittal decided to pull out of their multi-billion dollar steel plant projects frustrated by indecision and slow pace of approvals., a sense of urgency, nay desperation, came out clearly when dr.singh conceded that the >6.5 per cent economic growth targeted for 2013-14 would be missed. the gdp grew by 5 per cent in 2012-13, a decade low number. it grew at 6.2 per cent in 2011-12., full arsenal, a concerned dr. singh asserted that he would use all means available under his command to contain cad (current account deficit) that stood at a record 4.8 per cent of gdp (gross domestic product) in 2012-13. the reform initiatives are sought to be pushed through on a fast-track basis by dr. singh’s government at the fag-end of its second innings, brushing aside the rising wave of opposition protests. these measures will take a while to see benefits on the ground. what passes one’s comprehension is: why did dr. singh and his team wait this long, and rush an avalanche of steps at the eleventh hour? given its flip-flops on the policy front (especially the notorious retrospective taxation), it is doubtful if its fag-end pinch-hitting sort of actions will have any convincing effect on foreign investors who wish to partake in the india growth story., three strikes, the three critical components of the economy — oil, power and coal — are all mired in one controversy or the other. and, all of them together make life miserable not only for policy planners but also common citizens. this is precisely the reason why the twin deficits — current account deficit and fiscal deficit — are rearing their ugly heads, and have taken monstrous proportions. how do we put a lid on these two? that is easier said than done. the challenge lies in making people pay for the cost of a product or service, and forcing them to avoid conspicuous consumption (like buying gold). in the intervening ruckus, it appears, however, that the supply side of the economy has not commanded the requisite time, space, and energy from the fiscal bosses. all these are collectively damaging the india growth story., dr. singh was once the captain of the country’s monetary decision-making body. as the skipper of india, more than anybody in the government, he seems to understand the predicament of the governor of reserve bank of india. not surprisingly, he sort of endorsed the apex bank’s efforts to fix the rupee volatility issue. while doing so, however, the prime minister expressed the optimism that the reserve bank of india would reverse its action once the rupee stabilised., “the most immediate cause of worry is the recent volatility in the foreign exchange market,” he told the audience at the annual meeting of assocham in new delhi. the rupee swings have been hurting the cause of the indian economy what with the country is hugely dependent on imports for its oil needs. the rising gold import has only helped to accentuate the misery., quick crunch, the past week was indeed eventful, as the rbi, to the surprise of many, hurried to tighten liquidity in the market. it increased the marginal standing facility rate to 10.25 per cent from 8.25 per cent. msf was introduced in 2011-12 policy of the rbi to allow banks to borrow funds from it at 8.25 per cent, 100 basis points above the laf (liquidity adjustment facility) repo rate., as a result of this, the bank rate also stood adjusted to 10.25 per cent. the apex bank also announced open market sale of government bonds worth rs.12,000 crore on july 18. ostensibly, these measures were intended to stem the rupee slide by taking the speculative fizz out of the market., it did have the desired effect, as it ended the rupee’s foray into 60s. however, these measures have brought more headaches to the monetary bosses, and triggered unintended consequences., the rbi rejected all bids in the rs.12,000-crore treasury bill sale on wednesday. in thursday’s bond sale (rs.12,000 crore) in open market operations, the rbi could accept just a little over one-fifth of the bids. the rbi, however, managed to push through the issue of government bonds worth rs.15,000 crore, with yields roughly 50 basis points higher than a week ago. the rbi had to encounter stiff demand from underwriters who sought hefty commissions., failed bid, fearing that the liquidity tightening measures would have redemption pressures on mutual funds, the apex bank even opened a special repo window at an interest rate of 10.25 per cent for a total of rs.25,000 crore. it, however, did not receive any bids. cash-rich corporates appeared to have gone to the rescue of banks by picking up cheap units of liquid mutual fund schemes., a significant fall-out of the rbi action in the past week is that the benchmark 10-year bond yield has risen. this is bound to seriously erode the efforts of the rbi to drain liquidity from the system. what does this portend?

2013-07-21,fdi in defence is a positive for ashok leyland,"dheeraj hinduja, chairman, ashok leyland , the billionaire hinduja family, even in the best of times, is known for being quite media shy. this hasn’t stopped speculation, however, on whether third-generation family member dheeraj g. hinduja will propel the next wave of thinking and growth for the group. the next generation scion, who is currently focussing on the group’s india business and is the chairman of commercial vehicle maker ashok leyland, is at the helm at a time of economic slowdown and all-round depressed sentiment. in an interview with the hindu, dheeraj talks on the uncertainty in the commercial vehicle industry, defence procurements and more. excerpts:, this quarter has seen losses and tough shareholder queries. how do you look at the next three quarters for both the industry and ashok leyland?, it has become very difficult to predict what is happening in the commercial vehicles industry. even this slowdown in this quarter, nobody thought it would be this severe. the month of april started and when there was only a slight slowdown, everybody thought that q2 would be better. but q2 is here, and it’s looking quite depressed., so, at this point, sentiments are very depressed… the customers are depressed and there is uncertainty in the economy. i believe that until a few initiatives are taken in terms of infrastructural revival, mining restarting and the jnnurm that they have announced… unless some of these kick-start, it will be difficult., but in this kind of an economy, what are the positive signals that you are looking towards?, well, i think the positive from ashok leyland is that we are now ready with all new product launches. we have gone through our capital expenditure… we’ve gone through our investments. all these years, all you’ve had to do is look our balance sheet to see high debt, high investment and high capital expenditure. this is because all of these new ventures such as john deere or nissan, required a lot of capital., we’ve now been through it, and the advantage of launching these new products in this depressed economy is that we believe these products will offer better value to the customers. i think that in all customers will be better off in terms of our new offerings. you can see that from the dost, right up to the new products that we will be introducing, ashok leyland has a completely brand new portfolio., i think at this point, no other commercial vehicle manufacturer can match the type of offering that we have from bottom to the top., daimler entered the market nearly six months ago, how has the competition been so far?, we are not afraid of the competition, because we are ready for it and we had foreseen that it would come. the only thing i can say is that in the last financial year, despite the competition, we gained three percentage points in market share. apart from our new products, we have spent a lot more time improving our network. today, our touch-points in the north are greater than what we have in the south!, north, south, east, west… ashok leyland has a service capability throughout the country. in this industry, the customer looks out for the fact that whether he goes from chennai to delhi, if his vehicle breaks down, someone is there to support him. and that’s what we can offer today., discounts seem to have dragged this industry down, with ashok leyland now refusing to play that game. is there now a tactical understanding among players to allow this to taper off due to profitability issues?, i don’t think there is any tactical understanding, because every company is doing whatever it feels appropriate. we just felt it no longer made sense to be squeezing our margins even further by giving these levels of discounts. yes, it could mean a few percentage points drop in market share, but i think that will be very temporary., why will it be temporary? this is because you entice somebody to do a one-off buy, but, in the long-run, i don’t think any manufacturer can sustain this kind or level of discounts that we are seeing. so it’s been going on for the last three-four months… we have cut back. i think that if others pursue that strategy cutting back on discounts as well, it will be better for all of us and for the whole industry., with the new defence procurement policy, which comes with more domestic sourcing, and the relaxation of fdi in defence, how will this play out for ashok leyland?, well, i’m not giving you a direct answer, but the whole objective for ashok leyland is that we have to move away from these cycles that we experience. so the lcv is one extension, construction equipment is another, and defence is one as well., i think 49 per cent makes sense because there are a lot of technologies that are not available in india that is required by the indian army. you go to manufacturers overseas; they don’t want to part with their technology for 26 per cent. this is because they know that others can easily replicate it in the future., so, in that context, i think opening up fdi in defence is a very wise move by the government. i think that this will not only benefit the defence ministry but also for indian companies. in terms of impacting ashok leyland, i think it’s a major positive for us. we have been one of the largest suppliers of logistics vehicles and it gives us an extension into newer areas. we have been exploring this, but we’ve been waiting for the right policies to come in., aerospace and aeronautics was one adjacency you were talking of nearly three years ago. what happened to that?, as a group, we firmly believe in partnerships. this is not an area where we our own domain capability and we have tried to find the right partner. it’s a sector we want to enter in… we do have some specialists already within the group. finding the appropriate partner will be the next stage for us., do you think belt-tightening measures are in order, as several shareholders have suggested, as a means of combating the current slowdown?, i think that shareholder in question really misunderstood. the salaries for sesh sic and vinod dasari are approved by the shareholders at the agm. i don’t think its fair to compare a promoter , who holds an equity stake, versus somebody who runs the company as a professional. some of these statements concerning salaries of senior management are misinformed.",0.12335909561453035,fdi defence positive ashok leyland,"dheeraj hinduja , chairman , ashok leyland , billionaire hinduja family , even best times , known quite media shy. ’ stopped speculation , however , whether third-generation family member dheeraj g. hinduja propel next wave thinking growth group. next generation scion , currently focussing group ’ india business chairman commercial vehicle maker ashok leyland , helm time economic slowdown all-round depressed sentiment. interview hindu , dheeraj talks uncertainty commercial vehicle industry , defence procurements more. excerpts : , quarter seen losses tough shareholder queries. look next three quarters industry ashok leyland?

2013-07-21,looking beyond the headlines,"a view of the bharthi walmart-best price outlet in hyderabad. file photo | photo credit: p_v_sivakumar , the eye catching headlines on july 17 relating to the >relaxation of foreign direct investment (fdi) limits in a number of sectors were certainly impressive. they appeared to convey the impression that a round of “big bang” reforms was under way, this time through a sweeping liberalisation of fdi rules in several key sectors, including telecom, defence, commodity exchanges, power exchanges and insurance. certain sectors, however, did not share the munificence. they include civil aviation and media, where relaxations were anticipated., no red tape, not only could the fdis go up to 100 per cent in certain cases (notably telecom), but the procedure has been eased. investment approvals in many sectors will now come under the automatic route instead of through the more cumbersome procedures of the foreign investment promotion board (fipb)., some of these measures were anticipated, more likely wished for by protagonists of reform. the government did spring a surprise by announcing relaxations in so many sectors at one go. the avowed objective is to reverse the negative sentiment among overseas investors., the expectation is that even over the near-term, foreign money will start coming back. that, in turn, should stabilise the rupee which has been depreciating rapidly. looming large in government’s thinking is the size of the current account deficit, which at 5 per cent of the gross domestic product (gdp) in march 2013 (about rs.90,000 crore) is clearly unsustainable. adding to the pressure points are the persistently high oil prices. the rupee’s fall by nearly 5.5 per cent in june will inflate the petroleum import bill offsetting any tangible gains that might accrue from the sharply lower gold imports in june., unfazed reaction, however, the financial markets were not particularly impressed. the bellwether stock indices did not respond as favourably as one would have hoped for. the rupee slipped from a two-week high to close at 59.34 to the dollar. (it closed the week at >59.35 on july 19), if the government hoped for immediate results, it must have been disappointed. but realistically, fdi relaxations can impact only over time. how friendly are they to serious investors?, a few points are relevant here. one, the impression that the guidelines are final and can be acted upon is not correct. the cabinet has to approve these. even if that is seen to be routine — after all senior ministers are behind the guidelines — there are individual cases, notably the decision to raise the fdi cap in insurance to 49 per cent that require further approvals. the insurance bill incorporating the change is before parliament, its passage might be contentious., two, while procedures for approving the investments have been simplified, the government — through the fipb — still retains powers to approve the investments. in nearly all cases, for instance, where 100 per cent fdi will be permitted, up to 49 per cent will be cleared under the automatic route and the balance by the fipb. three, from the point of view of overseas investors, the guidelines might be most welcome but putting money in india at this juncture could be a difficult proposition for a variety of reasons., bad omen, in what could be a bad omen, two large overseas companies pulled out of their large projects almost at the very moment government announced the new fdi guidelines., on tuesday, korea’s posco announced its decision to exit from a $5.3 billion >steel project in karnataka citing difficulties in acquiring land and access to iron ore. much the same reasons were cited by arcelormittal, the world’s largest steelmaker while shelving its $7 billion project in odisha.",0.06261407990916189,looking beyond headlines,"view bharthi walmart-best price outlet hyderabad. file photo &#124; photo credit : p_v_sivakumar , eye catching headlines july 17 relating >relaxation foreign direct investment ( fdi ) limits number sectors certainly impressive. appeared convey impression round “big bang ” reforms way , time sweeping liberalisation fdi rules several key sectors , including telecom , defence , commodity exchanges , power exchanges insurance. certain sectors , however , share munificence. include civil aviation media , relaxations anticipated. , red tape , could fdis go 100 per cent certain cases ( notably telecom ) , procedure eased. investment approvals many sectors come automatic route instead cumbersome procedures foreign investment promotion board ( fipb ) . , measures anticipated , likely wished protagonists reform. government spring surprise announcing relaxations many sectors one go. avowed objective reverse negative sentiment among overseas investors. , expectation even near-term , foreign money start coming back. , turn , stabilise rupee depreciating rapidly. looming large government ’ thinking size current account deficit , 5 per cent gross domestic product ( gdp ) march 2013 ( rs.90,000 crore ) clearly unsustainable. adding pressure points persistently high oil prices. rupee ’ fall nearly 5.5 per cent june inflate petroleum import bill offsetting tangible gains might accrue sharply lower gold imports june. , unfazed reaction , however , financial markets particularly impressed. bellwether stock indices respond favourably one would hoped for. rupee slipped two-week high close 59.34 dollar.

2013-08-10,crisis looms on the horizon,"till barely a month ago, industry was pleading with the reserve bank of india to end the high interest rate regime that has brought its growth to a standstill and caused a wholesale flight of savings from the share market into land and gold. so the most puzzling feature of its reaction to the rbi’s july 30 decision to keep policy interest rates unchanged has been its silence., dire threat, this curious reversal begins to make sense only when seen against the backdrop of the dire threat the indian economy now faces. this is the imminence of a foreign exchange crisis that can wreck the economy in much the same way as the 1990-91 crisis almost did. the parallels between 2013 and 1991 are striking. at close to $400 billion, india’s foreign debt is a third larger than its reserves. the short-term component of the debt has risen sharply in the last two years. partly because of this, the servicing of the debt will absorb a staggering 59 per cent — $169 billion — of the country’s total reserves in the coming 12 months. to this must be added a deficit in the current account balance of payments that had risen alarmingly to $88 billion — 4.8 per cent of the gdp — in 2012-13. it is no surprise, therefore, that hedge funds abroad have begun to circle the indian economy, sensing the possibility of another “kill.”, a foreign exchange crisis now will be far more damaging than the crisis of 1991. in 1990, when iraq’s invasion of kuwait triggered the crisis, industry was growing at 12.8 per cent. what is more, indian companies had raised no capital abroad. so the foreign exchange crisis did not threaten them directly with insolvency. all they needed to resume growth was a renewed supply of foreign exchange and the freedom to grow., today, industry’s growth rate has been below one per cent for 20 months. so it has little of the resilience that it had in 1992. but what is giving india’s entrepreneurs nightmares is the foreign debt they have contracted since 2006-07. the outstanding amount is now $140 billion and the rupee’s fall is making this increasingly difficult to service and repay. what is worse, all but a fraction of the debt has been incurred by around 100 large indian firms that also account for close to 70 per cent of the domestic credit extended by commercial banks. if a rising debt service burden abroad forces them into insolvency, it will create a domestic liquidity crisis that will bring bank-lending to industry to a halt., for the embattled firms, the only way out will be to sell their prize assets. since there will be many sellers and few buyers, this sale will take place at bargain basement prices and, as happened in thailand and indonesia in 1998-99, foreign companies will cherry-pick the best of them. suzlon’s attempts to stave off bankruptcy by selling three quarters of its indian assets, and jet airways’ agreement to sell etihad airways a controlling share in the company are therefore only harbingers of the flood that will follow., this catastrophe can be averted only by reversing the outflow of capital from the country. for that to happen, foreign institutional investors have to start believing once again that they can make money by investing in the indian economy. they will do so only when share prices begin a sustained rise. for this to happen, there must be a revival of demand and investment in the economy. and this, in turn, will only happen if the rbi brings interest rates sharply down., had the rbi cut rates two years ago when the rupee was at 44.15 to the dollar and foreign exchange reserves were comfortably in excess of debt, fiis would not have needed much convincing. but today the government needs to combine a cut in interest rates with steps to bring down the current account bop deficit (cad) sharply, and reduce the private sector’s exposure to debt. for only then will investors feel reassured that the rise in imports that will accompany a revival of demand and investment will not tip india over into a balance of payments crisis., need for decisive action, the need of the hour, therefore, is coordinated and decisive action on several fronts. but the government’s responses have been uncoordinated and almost entirely reactive. over six weeks, the government and the rbi have quadrupled the customs duty on gold and limited its imports to five times the export of ornaments and jewellery; eased the entry of foreign direct investment into 12 sectors and raised the interest rate on bank borrowing from the marginal standing facility by two per cent., but the rbi has refused to lower interest rates and delhi has remained a helpless spectator. it is no surprise therefore that confidence in the government’s capacity to manage the economy has seeped away and speculative pressures on the rupee have mounted steadily., in june, $9 billion of foreign capital left the equity and debt markets. since then, the pessimism abroad about india’s future has deepened. one indicator of how deep it runs is that on july 30, when the rbi again did not lower the interest rates, commercial banks borrowed rs 26,500 crore — $4.25 billion — from the marginal standing facility at 10.25 per cent to enable their depositors to buy dollars. as the french bank, credit agricole, put it, “the situation in india is quickly turning into a vicious circle. … higher rates … lead to higher debt-servicing cost and worsening fundamentals (such as slackening demand and higher investment risk), which are the root cause of the rupee’s weakness.” not surprisingly, the rupee ended almost 3 per cent lower in a single day., unsuccessful attempts, delhi’s attempts to attract fdi have been equally unsuccessful. on the very day that it eased fdi entry in 12 sectors of industry, posco, the korean steel giant, pulled out of its 6 million tonne steel plant venture in india. arcelor mittal followed a day later. walmart has yet to invest a single dollar in the retail sector., india still has one shield against catastrophe — the rupee’s lack of full capital account convertibility. by slowing down the fall of the rupee it is once more buying the government time, as it did in 1997, to turn the economy around. if the government acts decisively now, it can do so with relative ease. india is already well on the way to reducing the cad, for the import of gold has fallen from $7 billion in april and 8.4 billion in may to $2.45 billion in june and about $4 billion in july., since gold and jewellery exports totalled $70 billion last year, the pegging of gold imports to jewellery exports is likely to bring future imports of gold from the current 800-1000 tonnes to between 300 and 400 tonnes a year. this will cut the import bill by $25 billion to 30 billion.",0.036561302681992335,crisis looms horizon,"till barely month ago , industry pleading reserve bank india end high interest rate regime brought growth standstill caused wholesale

2013-08-16,fdi policy for pharma set for overhaul to protect local units,"a chemist is seen working in a pharmaceutical lab. file photo. , the government is likely to come out with major changes in the foreign direct investment (fdi) policy in the pharmaceutical sector, and unveil steps to protect the domestic generic drug industry., high-level meeting, this was decided at a high-level meeting chaired by prime minister manmohan singh., the commerce and industry ministry has been asked to start inter-ministerial consultations on the issue, and single out dangers in the current fdi model. it has also been asked to bring out a cabinet note on the proposed overhaul of the policy in the pharmaceutical sector in consultations with the ministry of health., the government is also seriously considering reducing the 100 per cent fdi limit in the sector to protect domestic interests., commerce and industry minister anand sharma had, last month, urged the prime minister to urgently look into the matter and convene a high-level meeting on the issue. “in case the present fdi policy continues, then our domestic capability will gradually wither away. in that eventuality, india will be compelled to be dependent for life-saving medicines either on domestic facilities of mncs or on imports,” mr. sharma had conveyed to dr. singh., talking to reporters after the meeting with prime minister, mr. sharma said, “the meeting looked at two dimensions. one is that the proposals which have come under the existing policy, there are some concerns, particularly with regard to oncology, injectibles, and vaccines, where we see there is a critical need which must be met at all cost and that the policy will ensure”., before the proposals were placed before the foreign investment promotion board (fipb) for approval, they would have to go through the existing policy, he said., “if there are safeguards required that will be discussed as what should be the nature of safeguards so that affordable life-saving medicines are made available to the people,” he added., concern, there has been a growing feeling and concern within the commerce and industry ministry that the present policy is not serving its objectives and that it needs to be fine-tuned to ensure that cheap drugs are made available to the people at large. the other concern is that mncs have acquired brownfield projects of domestic companies but have spent very little on r&d in india. “they are doing only clinical trials in india and not actual drug development work. we will ask the health ministry to shortlist their concerns and suggest the verticals in the sector that should be sole domain of the indian companies,” a senior commerce ministry official, who was part of the meeting, said., the

high-end technology to india and the need for increased r&d efforts , avinash chander, chief architect of india’s agni series of missiles, took over as scientific adviser to the defence minister and director-general of the defence research and development organisation (drdo) on may 31, succeeding v.k. saraswat., dr. chander, who played a key role in the successful development of the 5,000-km-range agni-v, joined the drdo in 1972 after graduating as an electrical engineer from iit delhi., in an interview to the hindu, the new drdo chief speaks about key projects like the light combat aircraft (lca), the future of india’s missile programme, denial of high-end technology to india and the need for increased r&d efforts. excerpts from the interview:, on the lca project, the lca is going well. we said the initial operational clearance (ioc) 2 will be completed by this year end. ioc 2 is progressing very well and in spite of bad weather a number of sorties have taken place. hal team is working well along with the air force and a very well integrated operation is going on. we are very confident that ioc 2 will be completed on time. the final operational clearance is slated for 2014-end. meanwhile, production will start from this year onwards and we expect that the first aircraft will roll out in 2014. right now, we have orders from the indian air force for 40, in 20-plus-20 option. the naval version of lca is also going on well, prototype version (pv) 1 and pv2 are getting integrated, and pv1 should be completed by this year end., on the project’s cost overrun, the cost of lca is a small fraction of what an f-15 costs. we have developed one of the lowest costing aircraft. we are confident that the lca will be able to compete very well in performance as well as on cost basis with equivalent aircraft. it will be comparable to gripen aircraft. the day we start thinking about lca, you cannot start putting cost on it., on the missile programme, agni v is moving ahead. agni iv and v both are going to be inducted in the next couple of years. we will be going for user trials of agni iv which has a range of 4,000 km and agni v which has a range of 5,000 km. then we are going for long range surface to air missile (lrsam.) and its trials are going to take place in israel very soon. astra air-to-air missile programme is also going very well. astra will be going for the sukhoi su-30 launch by this year end. nag — we had very good tests for seekers also recently, we are confident that nag will also be able to meet performance requirements of the users in the very severe environmental conditions of the indian desert. we are also working on futuristic, new long-range surface-to-air missiles of 250 to 300 km range. we are working on multi-range missiles, also on short-range surface-to-air missile. the aim is to become globally competitive in terms of missile accuracy, lethality and range., on tactical missiles like prahar, prahar will go for user trial shortly, this year. prahar is a good surface-to-surface system with a range of 140 km. it will have an accuracy of two metres and that is a very vital addition. we are also enhancing the range of pinaka rockets from the existing 40 km to 60 km for pinaka mark ii. prahar will be the third layer to cover up to 140 km, which is a very potent layer., comparison with chinese missiles, in terms of technology and performance, indian missile systems are comparable with any other system in the world, including whatever our neighbours have — comparable and better also in some cases. total variety and ranges of the systems are decided based on each country’s individual requirements, how they see the threat and their role in the global scenario. the extent of the arsenal may differ but what we have is comparable with the best., on india’s quest for high-end technology, for high-end technology, nobody in the world will help you. we have to have our own initiative. this is one area where the country needs to give a lot more thrust. for example, the material gap — on metallic composites or carbon composites or polymeric materials, even sensors, rare earth materials — has been identified as the key area where we need to take up initiatives. today we have become highly self-sufficient and capable in designing world-class systems whether it is radars, missiles, or sonars, but what we need to strengthen is the sub-system and the components, devices and the raw materials. for the agni strategic system where we had no option to import, we have gone 85-per-cent indigenous. but similar things have to be done in other areas such as tactical missiles. we require tungsten and other materials which india does not produce. we have to take extra initiative in terms of investment and technology, infrastructure, knowledge generation., on the role of private sector, private sector is providing the infrastructure and in many cases they are joining hands with industries abroad but a lot more needs to be done in the private sector in the r&d department. if you see the industrial r&d in the u.s., it is almost 50 per cent of the total r&d expenditure, whereas in india it is very meagre part of it. and most of it is perhaps ceremonial., on fdi in defence, let good technology come in, there is no harm. we are not opening up just to get money., on indigenisation and licensed production, in today’s globalised environment, we have to see what needs to be bought, what needs to be developed and what needs to have transfer of technology. you cannot afford to make everything yourself. it is neither viable nor cost effective in the long-term — and that is where the decision has to be taken.",0.1948433709147995,developing indian defence,"avinash chander , new drdo chief

2013-08-22,"economy is challenged, chidambaram admits","even while asserting that the ongoing battering of the rupee in the currency markets was being overdone, finance minister p. chidambaram, on thursday, candidly admitted that the indian economy was indeed challenged as a consequence of global and domestic factors and the first quarter growth this fiscal would likely remain flat., however, the silver lining is that, with the various measures in the pipeline and a mix of economic indicators available, a likely pick-up in gdp (gross domestic product) growth can be expected in the remaining three quarters., at a press conference here to ward off pessimism over the indian currency breaching the psychological barrier of 65 to the dollar intra-day, mr. chidambaram said: “thanks to the global slowdown as well as some domestic factors, the indian economy is challenged. growth slowed down to 5 per cent in 2012-13, and we expect that the growth trend will remain flattish in the first quarter of the current fiscal…we expect that growth will pick up in q2 to q4 second to fourth quarter of 2013-14”., backing his optimism on this count to available trend indicators, mr. chidambaram pointed to the marked increase in sown area by about 9.1 per cent, the outcome of which is expected to be a bumper harvest. besides, the acceleration in the pace of plan expenditure and the impact of the projects cleared by the cci (cabinet committee on investment) in the last few months are also expected to lend support in this regard., during the last 12 months, the government, the finance minister said, took a number of measures to contain inflation and revive investment and growth., “some results are visible, yet there are many challenges that have to be overcome,” he said., as for the other positive indicators, such as capital flows by way of fdi (foreign direct investment) and the country’s debt situation, mr. chidambaram pointed out that on august 12, he had listed a number of measures that would be taken to enhance the capital inflows by about $11 billion. “work is in progress on these measures, and we are confident that the results will be visible in the near future,” he said., in particular, fdi inflows in the first quarter this fiscal, for instance, were $9.14 billion, an increase of 70 per cent over the same quarter last year. also, exports have risen by 11.7 per cent in july 2013 over july 2012 and the trade deficit in june and july 2013 narrowed to $12.3 billion each month. net services exports have increased every month since april and were at $6.1 billion in june this year as compared to $4.5 billion in the same month of 2012. “as a result, cad is narrower. we are exploring structural measures to further reduce the cad to sustainable levels and, in the meantime, to improve capital inflows,” he said.",0.07363075196408529,"economy challenged , chidambaram admits","even asserting ongoing battering rupee currency markets overdone , finance minister p. chidambaram , thursday , candidly admitted indian economy indeed challenged consequence global domestic factors first quarter growth fiscal would likely remain flat. , however , silver lining , various measures pipeline mix economic indicators available , likely pick-up gdp ( gross domestic product ) growth expected remaining three quarters. , press conference ward pessimism indian currency breaching psychological barrier 65 dollar intra-day , mr. chidambaram said : “thanks global slowdown well domestic factors , indian economy challenged. growth slowed 5 per cent 2012-13 , expect growth trend remain flattish first quarter current fiscal … expect growth pick q2 q4 second fourth quarter 2013-14 ” . , backing optimism count available trend indicators , mr. chidambaram pointed marked increase sown area 9.1 per cent , outcome expected bumper harvest. besides , acceleration pace plan expenditure impact projects cleared cci ( cabinet committee investment ) last months also expected lend support regard. , last 12 months , government , finance minister said , took number measures contain inflation revive investment growth. , “some results visible , yet many challenges overcome , ” said. , positive indicators , capital flows way fdi ( foreign direct investment ) country ’ debt situation , mr. chidambaram pointed august 12 , listed number measures would taken enhance capital inflows $ 11 billion. “work progress measures , confident results visible near future , ” said. , particular , fdi inflows first quarter fiscal , instance , $ 9.14 billion , increase 70 per cent quarter last year. also , exports risen 11.7 per cent july 2013 july 2012 trade deficit june july 2013 narrowed $ 12.3 billion month. net services exports increased every month since april $ 6.1 billion june year compared $ 4.5 billion month 2012. “as result , cad narrower. exploring structural measures reduce cad sustainable levels , meantime , improve capital inflows , ” said .","{'bjp': 0, 'cong': 0}",0,0
2013-08-25,innovation cannot grow in a clinic,"illustration: p. manivannan , how far is niit from your house?"" went the punchline of the it and education training company’s television advertisement nearly a decade ago. with a presence in over 30 countries, niit ltd. has been able to reach and teach hundreds of thousands of students globally., surviving through the it bubble and the proliferation of engineering colleges, niit may almost have managed to achieve its goal of putting a training centre not too far from every household in india. in 2004, its software development business was spun off into a separate entity—niit technologies., vijay thadani, who co-founded niit in 1981 and is currently the company’s ceo, sits on the board of niit technologies. in an interview to the hindu, mr. thadani talks on the current uncertain business environment, the it industry’s hiring problems and the way forward for niit. edited excerpts:, how is the general macro-economic environment shaping up for the it industry and niit technologies? is the industry well-equipped to deal with the headwinds ahead?, it’s becoming definitely much better than 2012. this year will be better than 2012. and 2014 should be much better than 2013., for niit technologies, our geographic revenue distribution works well in our favour sometimes, and other times not so much. however, the overall macro-economic environment is not one where everybody is jumping with joy. the general ambience is one of caution. and, the real problem for the industry is that innovation cannot grow in such an environment. innovation cannot grow in a clinic!, we’re trying out various things to weather the storm — outcomes-based solution, for instance. non-linear growth is working in the industry’s favour. we have successfully moved in the past from application maintenance development to infrastructure. and now the industry has moved from infrastructure into new area applications and so on., as it becomes more and more oriented towards business and becomes more strategic, the question becomes how do we deal with this and live with the current environment? moving to an ‘outcomes-based revenue model’ is merely an outcome of trying to adapt with the current environment., we’re all learning a lesson. the industry never saw what it meant to be in a cyclical business, and most of the it guys never studied economics, so we don’t realie that the fundamental of economics is that business is cyclical. you just have to discover what kind of a cycle it is, is it a 30-year cycle or a 3-year cycle. the it industry is beginning to figure this out. once one understands that it is cyclical, you can organise yourself. and then it is no longer the euphoria of past growth that drives us., are the new buzz areas for the it industry such as ‘social media, mobile, analytics and big data’ resulting in viable business deals?, here it is. when we talk of social media for an it company, it’s not about setting up a social media company. if i am an american express, the question is what is my consumer thinking about me? whatever two people spoke amongst each other was generally not known. there were surveys, all kinds of trp ratings, and other nonsense to figure out customer attention and traction., therefore, it’s about discerning the real noise from the chatter. when we say social media, we’re really talking about the huge analytics play that is present. every it company is worried about this. there are huge business deals out there….online reputation management has become a science by itself. niit university will soon offer a course in this as well., with the slowdown hitting the it industry, campus hiring is coming down. how is this affecting niit? can it be seen as a disadvantage and an advantage?, if you see, the net hiring in the industry reduced last year, and it will reduce this year also. what are the contributors to this? it’s not actually less business — it is the threat of less business. and this is important, the difference is important. i hate to use the word ‘bench’, but there is too much extra capacity. in good times, this extra capacity could have been used for research or skill upgradation, but, in bad times, it is just extra capacity., people feared that if business slowed down, then there would also be no margins to support that extra capacity. so, what does the industry do? they start taking graduates only when they need the graduates. but here’s the silver lining. while the it industry hiring reduced by 22 per cent, niit’s placements have dropped only by 4 per cent!, and we are not a small placement player. we place 40,000 students every year. now, why have our placements dropped less?, the just-in-time hiring trend has worked in our favour. companies don’t want to absorb all the graduates in june-july. all formal colleges end in april-may, which is why you have clogging in the month of june-july., if it companies need graduates in september or october — our business model suits that, because in niit, our graduates come out every month., second, and this is more important, we tapped into the re-training period. before the graduate can become productive in the it company, the company has to retrain them. this process usually takes 2-6 months. we told the it companies that we would give our graduates the necessary extra courses during the mandatory ‘bench time’ that fresh hires had to serve. whatever extra skill the it companies need to onboard our graduates quicker, we supply that., as you can imagine, this is a better proposition for companies, when compared to what normal colleges offer., the third and final reason why niit has better placements is that when you say the it industry’s net hiring has dropped, you need to understand what it industry you are referring to. all the numbers that nasscom gives are only those which are for it exports. we haven’t realised that our domestic it industry is becoming a large force., earlier, youngsters always looked at opportunity as being equal to it exports or equal to h-1b visas. now there’s an opportunity called domestic it. there are many companies which are creating small domestic solutions — nearly 3,000 of them at last count. we encourage these companies to come for recruitment at niit., the barometer used for hiring is still it exports; i feel a larger perspective is needed here., will it hiring and hiring in general start looking up soon? do you see any positive signals in today’s market?, i have a feeling that this trend will turn in the coming year — it has to. we are still growing — all companies have had good first quarter results. somebody hiring new employees needs to support those great results right? i have a feeling hiring will pick up next year. all these government reforms that are slowly seeing the light of the day, with many new sectors opening up to fdi, will actually create huge opportunities for young professionals to get into., india has always been very proud of its small-scale entrepreneurs. what the small-scale entrepreneur did in the manufacturing sector (think the guy who buys himself two lathes and did turning work for hindustan motors), which is how the ancillary industries came up for the auto industry. now manufacturing has many offshoots., the small-scale entrepreneur will now move from the manufacturing domain to the digital domain. leave it services — think about applications. a 17-year-old kid can create an app, and it can become the next big thing. as usual, of course, millions will come and only ten thousands will succeed. but this can’t be seen as a deterrent, tens of thousands are still better than zero after all. the emergence of a small entrepreneur in the digital age is an interesting opportunity., niit ltd. has been changing its business mix of late and is offering a variety of courses now. is it as a career choice no longer the golden option?, there are two reasons for our diversification. it’s not just because demand for it courses is going a little down, therefore, the others need to go up. we are sitting on a large part of a much bigger cake. we realised that we could keep nibbling on our piece, but after a point, increasing market share would be very difficult., the second is that we must increase the size of the cake. moving from ‘training in it’ to training through it is to increase the size of the cake. also notice that niit has come out with courses in the areas that are largely it-dependent or it-adjacent. so, we’ve come out with more banking and financial services. we are now the largest company in banking and financial services training., our bpo training is also another example. we are also getting into new areas like design and digital marketing., again, if you notice, all of these are adjacent to it. the idea is that if an individual takes the trouble to contact us — and we offer only the same idli (well known as that idli might be), it is a little bad. i can offer other dishes right?",0.1059125481000481,innovation cannot grow clinic,"illustration : p. manivannan , far niit house ?

2013-08-30,this perverse rage against the poor,"edit page statecradft 300813 | photo credit: surendra , this week’s received wisdom insists that the indian economy has irretrievably collapsed because on monday, the lok sabha passed the national food security bill (nfsb). the hindu business line headline (aug.28, page 1) said it all: “re, sensex sink on fears food bill will feed deficit.” the subtext of the lament appears to be that the rupee decline was the market’s way of registering a pointed disapproval of the food security initiative. the schadenfreude-wallahs are as happy as are the market-reformers that the united progressive alliance (upa) leadership has been fixed so gloriously for venturing into a “populist” course of action. the bandwagon routine has acquired a momentum of its own; even hindi and other vernacular newspapers have allowed themselves to be mesmerised by the crisis-mongering on television. this, though, is no time to panic. this is the time to strike a balance between short-term difficulty and long-term promises and commitments., what wrong signals?, once every few decades comes a moment in a republic’s life when a few fundamental commitments have to be renewed — or rejected. this is one such week, a time to test our core beliefs. it is also the time to ask a fundamental question: since when in this country has a veto been ceded to the markets and its manipulators, at home and abroad, to decide the issues of equity, social justice and economic fairness? there is something inherently perverse in the suggestion that this much-needed welfare measure would send out the “wrong” signals. pray to whom? those half-a-dozen professional financial manipulators in london?, indeed, economists can always be relied upon to argue that there is always a better way to do anything. some are competing among themselves to declare that this food security initiative will neither work, nor fetch any votes for the ruling party. let us make no mistake. beyond all these sophisticated arguments is a certain class prejudice, resentful that so many resources are being “wasted” for the poor and other socially disadvantaged people, that in this age of “reforms,” political considerations and calculations are being allowed to determine the allocation of societal resources., this misses the very essence of the concept of political legitimacy in a democratic arrangement. a democracy survives and prospers only when every stakeholder gets an abiding sense of participation, partnership and entitlement. we often seem to keep forgetting that politics is all about who gets what at whose expense. during these last five years, at least for most of the time, the corporates and their policy preferences have been accorded unprecedented acceptance. the time is ripe to strike a new balance. and the nfsb does just that., reform by stealth, if we are honest with ourselves, we will have no difficulty in acknowledging that for 20 years, economic reforms have been operationalised without a political mandate. not until recently when the congress party held a public meeting to rally opinion behind the manmohan singh government’s fdi policy, did any political party have the courage to proclaim openly and boldly its commitment to “economic reforms.” yet, the “reforms” have been routinely and regularly proclaimed to be “irreversible,” irrespective of the political colour of the government in new delhi. the process has well been summed up in that evocative phrase, “reform by stealth.”, so now, when we are confronted with a veritable economic meltdown, we are ill-equipped to attend to the more serious and more debilitating crisis of our democratic project running out of its popular legitimacy. india’s democratic arrangements no longer appear to have the requisite social and political sanctions behind them. and we are unable to deal adequately with the systemic overload because our public discourse has been hijacked by a self-serving advocacy crowd and by a professionally disoriented media. for example, a year ago there was carping all around that the crony capitalists and the corrupt politicians were robbing the nation of its wealth, and we staged massive spectacles of resentment at jantar mantar; now, a year later, we are ranting and raving that we are not listening to or heeding those who rig the stock markets., if shouting and screaming every evening could produce solutions to difficult and complex problems, india would have been the most efficacious and working corner of planet earth. despite the obvious disapproval of the shouting class, the upa leadership has gone ahead with the food security bill. hence, the exaggerated anger., as social philosopher roberto mangabeira unger points out, a peaceful social order is in itself not enough; “ society must be set up in a manner capable of justification in the yes of each of its members.” in political economy terms, each section of society, and every stakeholder gets to determine: what is in it for me? the democratic project is a social compact, an indefinable construct, but nonetheless one that hinges on a promise of a fair deal for all. the poor are asking this question with greater urgency — and in the maoist-strongholds with arms and blood — as decades of “economic growth” have produced new inequities and disparities., rather than wait for the next round of the “maoist” violence to jerk us back to harsh realities, what the food law does is that at one stroke, it sends out a message that the indian state has not turned its back on the poor, and that the have-nots continue to have a claim on the collective resources, and that they have not been left to their own devices or to the market’s curative potency., this message has to be understood and appreciated in the context of the growing preference in some quarters for authoritarian solutions — throw out the encumbering paraphernalia of social equity or fairness, and let the floodgates of enterprise and business acumen be thrown wide open., resenting interventionism, a decade of economic prosperity has allowed millions and millions of middle-class families to realise their upwardly revised aspirations and life experiences; at the same time, the upa saw to it that the welfare state kept expanding the “social agenda,” providing a safety net against the vagaries of the market., now, the good days have seemingly come to an end, and there is anger that the state remains equally mindful of the welfare poor. we all thought that the poor have been disappeared from the policy drawing room; and suddenly, they are back with almost a veto. the narrative-controllers resent that. just when they thought they had successfully defanged the indian state of its interventionist impulses, here comes the food security bill.",0.04429085765719429,perverse rage poor,"edit page statecradft 300813 &#124; photo credit : surendra , week ’ received wisdom insists indian economy irretrievably collapsed monday , lok sabha passed national food security bill ( nfsb ) . hindu business line headline ( aug.28 , page 1 ) said : “re , sensex sink fears food bill feed deficit. ” subtext lament appears rupee decline market ’ way registering pointed disapproval food security initiative. schadenfreude-wallahs happy market-reformers united progressive alliance ( upa ) leadership fixed gloriously venturing “populist ” course action. bandwagon routine acquired momentum ; even hindi vernacular newspapers allowed mesmerised crisis-mongering television. , though , time panic. time strike balance short-term difficulty long-term promises commitments. , wrong signals?

2013-09-17,the malaise that drove down the rupee,"the recovery of the rupee and the euphoric rebound of the markets in the last few days would appear to suggest that the economy is back on track again. nothing could be more wrong. the flurry of policy announcements in recent weeks is based on the diagnosis that the relentless slide of the rupee, attributed to the widening current account deficit (cad), can be arrested if and when capital inflows — as investments or borrowings — fill the gap., reserve bank of india governor raghuram rajan’s recent announcement allowing banks to borrow from global capital markets at a time when interest rates are rising because of the expected reversal of the united states federal reserve’s easy money policy is tailored to this logic. indian banks can now borrow up to 100 per cent of their combined net worth and long term borrowings from the international market (compared to 50 per cent earlier) and then “swap” them with the central bank. this is expected to augment the supply of foreign exchange by an estimated $30 billion, which is about one-tenth of indian foreign exchange reserves. the markets reacted euphorically, but the risks of the country borrowing its way out of trouble have been much less appreciated., the two-track policy — of making india more attractive to foreign investors by deepening “reforms” and of borrowing more — is fraught with serious consequences. the policy response suggests that the ongoing crisis is only a temporary blip in the great indian growth story. but it appears that the seeds of the crisis were sown in that very story., a striking feature of the story is that indian corporates borrowed like there was no tomorrow — from not only indian banks but also from overseas capital markets. consider this: between 2003-04 and 2010-11 the indian corporate sector’s share of net bank credit increased from 31 per cent of gross domestic product (gdp) to over 37 per cent. in fact, since 2006-07, their share has been consistently higher than net bank credit to the government., infrastructure companies’ (power, roads and telecom) share in total bank credit increased from about 9 per cent in 2003 to more than 33 per cent in 2011. the spectacular increase is responsible for the mounting burden of non-performing assets in the indian banking sector today. according to an oft-cited report in the media, prepared by the credit suisse group in 2012, the debt of 10 indian corporate groups whose interests range from oil and gas and steel to infrastructure increased from about rs. one lakh crores in 2006-07 to rs. 5.4 lakh crores in 2011-12 — a compounded annual rate of 40 per cent., the fact that private fixed investment did not increase at the same pace is perhaps because a large portion of the credit was diverted by indian companies to what would appear to be an asset bubble — in land, shares in companies and other speculative assets. the clamour by corporate lobbies that interest rates be lowered has no respect for economic logic, given the state of the country’s external balances. they fail to appreciate that the era of cheap-credit fuelled growth is well and truly over., but this increase in domestic credit was dwarfed by the remarkable increase in the inflows of foreign capital following the global economic meltdown in 2008., the share of capital inflows — external borrowings, foreign direct investment (fdi) and foreign institutional investors (fii) — increased from about 5-6 per cent of gdp to about 9 per cent in 2011. the share of costlier short-term borrowings (almost entirely by private companies) in overall borrowings increased from 4.5 per cent in 2002-03 to 25 per cent in 2012-13. companies, lulled into borrowing at illusorily low interest rates, have been surprised by sharp increase in the rupee-denominated value of their loans., inflows of fdi registered a spectacular rise — from $9 billion in 2005-06 to $33 billion in 2010-11. popular understanding is that while fii investments are volatile, fdi is much more stable, long term in nature and contributes to improving the competitiveness of recipient nations. however, the story of india’s dalliance with fdi is shockingly different and raises serious doubts about whether the ongoing attempts to woo investors is sustainable or even desirable., a study co-authored by biswajit dhar, director general, research and information systems for developing countries, based on a painstaking dissection of every fdi project entailing an investment of $5 million and more between 2004 and 2009, provides shocking insights that prove that a large proportion of fdi is just as volatile and transitory as portfolio capital. the study that considered 2,748 projects, which accounted for almost 90 per cent of all fdi in the 2004-2009 period, found that the lowering of norms prescribing the minimum level of equity stake in an “fdi invested” project — from 40 per cent to 10 per cent — offered perverse incentives to capital flowing in the garb of fdi., less than half of the investment was actually fdi; private equity, venture capital and hedge funds, which are volatile and normally associated with short investment horizons, accounted for 27 per cent; and about 10 per cent was actually portfolio investment. over 10 per cent of the “investment” was round tripping by indian entities, which funnelled money back through tax havens in order to take advantage of tax concessions and other inducements available to fdi projects., a large proportion of the investment was by entities masquerading as investors committed to the long haul or investments that enhanced the productive capacity. indeed, manufacturing, which advocates of fdi said would be a key beneficiary, received only one-fifth of the investment; but even in this case portfolio and other short-horizon investors accounted for almost 40 per cent of the total investment. interestingly, while much attention has been focussed on the rising import of oil and gold, little attention has been paid to the fact that the trade deficit in manufactured goods has widened from $1.5 billion in 2004-05 to $45.5 billion in 2011-12 (about 2.5 per cent of gdp)., if there is any truth in the old cliché that a crisis is also an opportunity, surely this is a time to rebalance the indian economy on a more sustainable path that allows policymakers to use levers that are more easily within their control. of course, this would require import curbs and other measures suited to these hard times. but rebalancing would also require the use of measures such as the fiscal deficit, which have been for far too long a strict no-no in the policymakers’ handbook., the stubborn opposition to the good old-fashioned keynesian logic of using a fiscal deficit to get the economy back on its feet is grounded in the apparently intuitive logic that equates a government deficit with a household deficit. a classic example of such misguided thinking is evident in the loud opposition to the food security bill. quite apart from the fact that such a measure would provide a measure of security to the poor, the implementation of the legislation promises economy-wide benefits., first, the guarantee of subsidised food grains, which constitutes a significant proportion of the consumption basket for most people, will have the immediate effect of increasing their disposable income. this is not trivial, given that the growth of consumption expenditure has halved between 2009 and 2012., second, the provision can play the role of an economic stabiliser because food prices determine the floor wage level, which is why they are termed a wage good. the guarantee would thus not only help in controlling food prices but also stabilise wages. indeed, it is perplexing that industry lobbies are attacking the provision of an enhanced social wage, from which they stand to benefit significantly.",0.08959278155706726,malaise drove rupee,"recovery rupee euphoric rebound markets last days would appear suggest economy back track again. nothing could wrong. flurry policy

2013-09-27,it’s an inviting skyline,"s.v. ranganath, chief secretary; v.p. baligar, cmd, hudco; and j.c. sharma, chairman, ficci sub-committee on south india real estate & md-vc, sobha developers, at the south india real estate conference in bangalore. photo: g.r.n. somashekar , strong demand for housing from a growing number of people streaming into cities with professional degrees and technical skills, and mushrooming job opportunities is emerging as the most important driver of real estate sector growth in south indian cities. while housing will remain the rosiest lure for developers as it caters to the end-users, the scenario down south is also brightened with new entrepreneurial ventures springing up on a daily basis., while real estate is a sunrise sector in the indian economy, south indian states represent the most attractive destination for global investors. it is estimated that nearly 45 per cent of the country’s office space stock will be located in southern states with more than 64 per cent of the country’s it and ites sezs located in the same area., according to j.c. sharma, chairman, ficci sub-committee on south india real estate, and managing director, sobha developers, the fundamentals of real estate in the south are constantly good as demand is largely driven by an end-user market, which provides for limited volatility in prices. millions of jobs constitute an added assurance that the sector will continue to remain rosy in the coming decades., v.p. baligar, chairman and managing director, hudco, says the urbanisation trend indicates that the sector will have a sustained growth as 41 per cent of the people in the southern states live in cities and towns in comparison to 31.2 per cent in north indian states., while all these might give a cause for cheer, the realty sector faces issues which need to be tackled if growth has to be sustained over a long period. foremost among them is the need to maintain social stability which faces threat in the wake of lopsided economic prosperity among various components of the population., biggest challenge, the karnataka chief secretary, s.v. ranganath, put some of them in perspective. according to him affordable housing remains the most crucial challenge for the real estate sector. he says developers and realtors should consider how to deliver a 600 sq. ft quality house for rs. 6-7 lakh to an ordinary family as their foremost concern. congestion, slums, poor transportation, pollution and scarcity of water and deficient amenities such as sewage, roads, power and retreating green spaces add to the woes of the urban dwellers and threaten social health/ harmony., speaking at the south india real estate conference 2013 in bangalore on september 19, mr. ranganath said smaller cities were growing at a faster rate than the big cities and there was need not only to assess the qualities of the migrants but even their aspirations. responding to the developers’ worries, mr. ranganath admitted that red tape was the biggest constraint for the growth of real estate as 18 different clearances (noc from minor irrigation dept., bsnl, fire force, airport, bescom, establishment, and pollution control board, khata bifurcation, occupancy certificate etc)., were time consuming and hiked the cost of the construction., he advised developers to benefit from sakala schemes which covered several of these services. while disclosing that the state government would be announcing the affordable housing policy in october, he stressed the need for more transparency in the real estate sector. the lack of it was a major hindrance in attracting foreign direct investment., financing trends, it is pointed out that india is currently 20th in the list of world’s top real estate investment markets with investment volume of $3.4 billion in 2012 and trends available for 2013 so far indicate that it has only increased this year. while there seems to be unanimity among developers that recession did not hit the real estate sector in india (m. murali, md, shriram properties, even declaring that there will be no recession in the next 30 years) and that there was plenty of money in the market, some cautioned that the nature of capital had changed., says arshdeep sethi, md, development, rmz corp., “capital is still available, it remains important for us to understand where capital is needed. investors want their money to be safe and to return with dividends. they are selective and only opt for highly credible developers. overseas investors also exist and have choices in emerging markets such as china and brazil. investors are now buying a real core asset and see if the cash flow is supported.”, major challenge, prakash kalothia, ceo and md, sun-area property partners, says developers want more risk (equity) capital, not the debt capital. he adds that overestimating profits and under-estimating the cost has been a major challenge for the sector, which is unrealistic. there is also near general agreement that the cost of capital will come down with more trust and transparency in the sector and improvement on this count has begun showing results since 2009., some of them even hinge their hopes on recently initiated legislative reforms pertaining to real estate regulatory bill, land acquisition bill and game changers such as fdi in multi-brand retail, and sebi’s plans to launch real estate investment trust (reit) on the alternative investment fund (aif)., hudco chairman v. p. baligar summarises the financing challenges as 1: non-availability of cheaper and long-tenure finance; 2: high cost of capital for builder; 3: high npa (non-performing assets) and credit risk; 4: rising inventories (average tenure of unsold flats: mumbai - 48 months, bangalore - 25 months, and delhi - 23 months); and 5: non-availability of home loans for ews (economically weaker sections) and lig (low-income groups)., land acquisition, varied trends could be noticed in matters of land acquisition, the major stumbling block for the real estate sector. according to ravindra sannareddy, md, sri city pvt. ltd. (sri city is spread over a 100 sq. km area, 55 km from chennai on the golden quadrilateral developed on the work-live-learn-play concept), innovative methods would ease hindrances in acquisition of land., citing the sri city example, he says the developers promised (and provided) jobs to those who lost their land as well as trained them for various vocations necessary in the developing township. he, however, agrees it is easier to get the land from the government rather than from farmers., for anita arjun das, md & ceo, mahendra lifespace developers, which acquired land both in chennai and jaipur, the approach involved giving a developed portion of land back to original landowners.",0.12785909692159694,’ inviting skyline,"s.v. ranganath , chief secretary ;

2013-11-17,a new deal for foreign banks,"even while the issue of granting bank licences to a few private banks is gaining traction, the reserve bank of india (rbi) has released important guidelines for foreign banks to participate in the indian financial sector in a bigger way than what has been possible so far., the two developments have one common objective — they are meant to deepen the financial sector. if all goes well, a few new private sector banks will advent in early 2014. at the moment, there are 26 applicants, who have met the stiff eligibility criteria, and are being vetted by an independent committee of experts headed by former rbi governor bimal jalan., awarding licences to corporates has been the most contentious issue in the new licensing policy, but once the decision was made, a few of the india’s biggest companies have put in their applications., the major theme, the framework for foreign banks has one major theme — the formation of wholly-owned subsidiaries (wos) for furthering their business in india. the rbi guidelines make it clear that the wos model is what the regulator would prefer the foreign banks to have. suitable incentives are being given to new as well as existing players operating through their branches in india to adopt the subsidiary route and incorporate locally., origin of policy, like the new private bank licensing policy, the framework for foreign banks has passed through several stages., the origin of the new policy is to be traced to the year 2004 when the government relaxed the foreign direct investment (fdi) limits to 74 per cent in private sector banks. simultaneously, foreign banks were permitted to set up a 100 per cent wholly-owned subsidiary in india subject to certain conditions. a detailed roadmap for operationalising the fdi guidelines, in two stages, was issued subsequently. then, as now, the objective was to encourage foreign banks to take the wos route. but in the absence of any incentives, no bank came forward to set up or convert their branches into wos., if the latest policy is to succeed and attract new foreign banks in the wos route, the type of incentives naturally matter. great significance is attached to the proviso that a locally incorporated wos will be given near-national treatment, which, for all purposes, will place them on a par with indian banks., for instance, they can open branches anywhere in the country (except in sensitive areas where rbi prior approval will be required). it is expected that foreign banks already operating branches in india will also see in the national treatment a big advantage and convert themselves into wos and participate in all financial sector activities. the wos will have a minimum paid-up capital of rs.500 crore, which is what has been stipulated for the new private banks., corporate guidelines for the wos include a proviso that not less than 50 per cent of the directors should be indian nationals/nris/pios., further, not less than two-thirds of the directors should be non-executive directors and a minimum of one-third of the directors should be independent of the subsidiary., the fear of foreign banks taking over the indian financial sector has been there ever since the fdi rules were liberalised., to assuage such apprehensions, restrictions would be placed on further entry of new wos of foreign banks/capital infusion, when the capital and reserves of foreign banks and their wholly-owned subsidiaries exceed 20 per cent of the capital and reserves of the banking system,, this stipulation is unlikely to satisfy either the foreign banks or those who want the rbi to spell out a more workable system of restraining them., on the foreign banks taking over small private banks, the guidelines are circumspect. the rbi would wait and watch before allowing mergers and acquisitions., evidently, how foreign banks fare in the new dispensation will matter.",0.027342873176206515,new deal foreign

2013-11-20,mars orbiter tests have shown our ability to predict: isro chairman,"after the polar satellite launch vehicle (pslv-c25) put india’s mars orbiter into a perfect earth-bound orbit on november 5, it has been a smooth journey so far for the spacecraft. the indian space research, organisation (isro) boosted the mars orbiter’s apogee in six complex manoeuvres executed between november 7 and 16. isro did this by giving commands from the ground to the spacecraft’s propulsion system, called 440 newton engine, to fire. a crucial event of the trans-mars injection of the spacecraft will take place on december 1 by a prolonged firing of the 440 newton engine., in this context, the hindu met k. radhakrishnan, isro chairman, on november 18 in his office at isro headquarters, bangalore, for his assessment of what has been achieved so far in india’s mars orbiter mission, what lies ahead, the complexity of the mission, the spacecraft’s autonomy to take decisions on its own when there is an emergency etc.. excerpts from the interview with dr. radhakrishnan, who is also chairman, space commission and secretary, department of space:, how do you assess what has been achieved so far in isro’s mars orbiter mission?, after the launch of the pslv-c25 on november 5, the separation of the mars orbiter from the launch vehicle was smooth and the injection of the spacecraft into the earth-bound orbit was precise. during the last few days, we have been raising the spacecraft’s orbit, specifically its apogee in steps. the first orbit-raising manoeuvre was done in the early hours of november 7. till now, we have completed six manoeuvres including a supplementary one. currently, the spacecraft’s apogee is 1,92,915 km., in the early hours of december 1, around 00.36 hours, we have the trans-mars injection of our mars spacecraft. on that day, we are going to use the 440 newton liquid engine again to impart a delta-v, that is, an incremental velocity of nearly 648 metres a second to the spacecraft and the engine will burn for 1,351 seconds. it is crucial in the sense that we need to give the exact velocity required to take the spacecraft from the earth-orbit, passing through the sphere of influence of the earth which extends up to 9.25 lakh km from the earth, cruise through the long helio-centric phase, then get into the sphere of influence of mars, and on its arrival near mars on september 24, 2014, it has to be put into 376 km plus or minus 50 km above mars at that point of time. on the same day, the next crucial operation of the spacecraft’s mars orbit insertion has to take place., when this running of the 440 newton liquid engine takes place on december 1, we also have eight numbers of 22 newton control thrusters firing., what will these control thrusters do?, there are two tasks for them. one is the spacecraft’s attitude control. secondly, if it is required, they will aid the 440 newton thrusters to augment its thrust-level. both the functions will be performed and the mars spacecraft will then be moving towards the helio-centric orbit. then on december 11, we plan to have one small firing for mid-course correction of the spacecraft. there may be one more mid-course correction during the helio-centric phase, and subsequently, a fortnight before the spacecraft’s arrival near mars, there will be one more mid-course correction. so there will be three mid-course corrections between december 1, 2013 and september 24, 2014., what is the purpose of these mid-course corrections of the mars spacecraft’s trajectory?, with the velocity imparted to the spacecraft on december 1, 2013, we will have an estimate of its expected position on september 24, 2014. we will be continuously tracking the spacecraft and if there are deviations vis-à-vis the end goal, we will make the corrections. so december 1 will be a crucial operation. the spacecraft’s propulsion system, i.e., the 440 newton liquid engine, will complete its first phase of operations on december 1. it has to be re-started for its operation on september 24. there is thus a long gap., how confident are you that you can re-start the 440 newton engine after it has hibernated in deep space for about 300 days during the spacecraft’s voyage?, we have been using the 440 newton engine for our geo-synchronous satellite - gsat- missions where the spacecraft’s orbit has to be raised about a week after its launch. in the case of chandrayaan-1, we had to restart the operation after a fortnight. for that, we had qualified the liquid engine in 2008 to restart after one month., during the last two years, considering the specific requirements of our mars orbiter mission for re-starting the spacecraft’s 440 newton engine after it has idled for about 300 days, we had done these two actions. one is we have provided a set of parallel circuits for the propellants’ flow-lines and also provided redundancy in the form of a latch-valve. so what essentially happens is that one portion of the fluid circuit will be closed after december 1. the parallel path will be energised for the operation in september 2014., secondly, we had fired the liquid engine in a special test facility established at the liquid propulsion systems centre at mahendragiri, tamil nadu, for its performance after the re-start. it has been found to be within the specifications. the performance degradation of the engine to restart after such a prolonged period has been only around two per cent and it is well within limits. in the spacecraft’s orbit-raising manoeuvres, during its trans-mars injection and its insertion into the martian orbit, the firing of the liquid engine is done in a closed loop mode. here, a precision accelerometer is used to estimate the incremental velocity added as the liquid engine burns and when the accelerometer gives a feedback that the required incremental velocity added to the spacecraft has been achieved, the burning of the liquid engine is automatically terminated. so, minor variations in the performance of the liquid engine will not matter because we are cutting off its burning based on the delta-v that is achieved. that is why we call it closed loop of firing., in the absence of such an arrangement, the liquid engine would have been commanded to fire for a given period and any variation in its performance would have resulted in a variation in the incremental velocity. but here, what you have to achieve is the incremental velocity. when the programmed incremental velocity is achieved, the engine is cut off., so what i am trying to convey here is that minor variations in the performance of the liquid engine is not going to affect the mission. if the engine has to work for a few seconds more or a few seconds less, it will be decided by the computer., in the pslv itself, we have the closed loop guidance system where the rocket’s fourth stage burning is terminated, based on the conditions achieved. that arrangement is there in the mars orbiter’s propulsion system., up to 9.25 lakh km from the earth, the spacecraft will be in the sphere of influence of the earth. subsequently, it will be moving into the helio-centric phase of its flight. it is a long one, where you have to look at the influence of other planets and the moon and then the solar radiation pressure acting on the spacecraft. that pressure varies with respect to time because the geometry of the sun and the spacecraft matters here. this is something we have not done so far and this helio-centric phase of the flight is new to us., in chandrayaan-1, we had travelled up to four lakh km, which was well within the sphere of influence of the earth. but here for the first time, we are moving out of the sphere of influence of the earth. so how the spacecraft will behave during the helio-centric flight of 680 million km along the arc is new to us. then the spacecraft gets into the sphere of influence of mars which is nearly six lakh km from mars., from our understanding of the mars gravity model, the influence of the atmosphere of mars, the influence of the two satellites of mars and the solar radiation pressure there on the spacecraft are very important. this is also a new thing that we are attempting., so the navigation of the mars spacecraft from the orbit of the earth to the orbit of mars, passing through all these three phases, is a new knowledge that we are acquiring and validating during the next 300 and odd days., you have stressed that the centrepiece of our mars orbiter is its autonomy. can you explain how it can take decisions on its own when there are emergencies?, since long distances are involved in this mission, there will be a delay in the signal from the ground reaching the spacecraft and vice versa. this delay could be of the order of six minutes to 20 minutes one way. in the spacecraft, we have provided redundancies for the critical components and sub-systems. in a normal situation, the ground controllers assess the performance of its systems and give commands from the ground for the switch-over from the primary system to the redundant system if there is an emergency. in this particular case, the spacecraft itself has to assess the performance of its systems and this is called fault detection, isolation and reconfiguration - fdir., secondly, when we need to operate a scientific instrument on board the spacecraft, a chain of commands has to be sent to the spacecraft for reconfiguring it both in terms of its orientation and selection of its various sub-systems and components for the specific payload operation., normally, these are sent from the ground. but in the case of the mars spacecraft, due to the long communication delay, such chains of commands are stored in the spacecraft and they are triggered based on the command from an on-board sequencer. such commands are, therefore, based on the time-tagged commands sent through the on-board sequencer. you load them well in advance and give the command that at this particular instant, it has to start. if a firing or an operation has to take place at a particular point t, you load the commands well in advance and say that it has to start at this instant., this is what is provided for in this mission., the third level of autonomy is to enable the spacecraft to put itself in a “safe mode” in the event of a major anomaly and wait for the commands to be received from the ground. when we say that it has to be put in the “safe-mode”, its antenna should be pointing towards the earth and the solar panels should be in a position to receive the energy from the sun. that means the spacecraft is safe and you can send commands to it. these three levels of autonomy are provided in the spacecraft., during the orbit-raising manoeuvres which started on november 7 and which went on till the morning of november 16, isro has been testing the performance of these redundant systems on the spacecraft and exercising the option of bringing them into operation., the gyroscopes, accelerometers, star-sensors, and attitude and orbit-control electronics, attitude control thrusters, the fdir and the thrust augmentation logic, which enables the augmentation of the thrust of the 440 newton liquid engine by eight numbers of 22 newton control thrusters during the critical phases of operation, were tested. the termination of the burn of the 440 newton engine, based on the feedback from the accelerometer, was tested. the on-board sequencer, which is used to store and initiate time-tagged command, was also tested., all these tests took place during the nine days from november 7 to november 16?, all these were tested during the orbit-raising manoeuvres. the expected orbital parameters have been achieved closely. it shows our ability to predict and we have seen that happen. currently, the mars orbiter is in a highly elliptical orbit with an apogee of 1,92,915 km., regarding our preparedness for the spacecraft’s trans-mars injection on december 1, as on today, we have raised the spacecraft’s apogee to the required 1.9 lakh km. we have raised its orbital inclination and other parameters to the required level. we have tested the spacecraft’s sub-systems and the provision for autonomous operations when required., during the next ten days, we will be exercising the orbiter’s high-gain antenna and the medium-gain antenna which are required to be used when the spacecraft is far away from the earth. during the orbiter’s earth-phase in the coming ten days, we will be energising its scientific instruments to check their health., what are the preparations under way for the lift-off of the geo-synchronous satellite launch vehicle (gslv-d5) in december this year? it was to put gsat-14 into orbit in august last. the lift-off was aborted then because of the leak of liquid propellants from the rocket’s second stage.",0.06818200639939774,mars orbiter tests shown ability predict : isro chairman,"polar satellite

2013-12-02,an economic agenda for india 2020,"setting a 2020 perspective economic agenda for india requires clarity about the framework within which economic policy choices have to be made. there is a wide global consensus today that democracy and competitive market economy provide that framework. democracy is a system of governance by consent of the people. democracy has become the trend, the accepted system of government globally, and it is spreading worldwide., furthermore, devolved democracies better manage contradictions and conflicts arising out of a heterogeneous society and provide effective feedback through an independent press to enable corrective action by the government. it empowers people to question the authorities and make them accountable in an election., moreover, the comparative economic results in east and west germany, north and south korea, china before reform and china now, have conclusively proved that a competitive market system driven by incentives is superior to a coercive, state-controlled system, and that transparent democracy is a better system of governance than a closed dictatorship., with the disintegration of the ussr into 16 countries in 1991, the comparative economic development theory has changed its focus from a study of alternative systems to alternative governance models of democracy, market system and globalisation, that is, change of focus from dictatorship vs. democracy, and state ownership vs. competitive market, to harmonising freedom and choice, with regulation, and how much public sector and how much private, and how the emancipating and enabling power of democracy is to be balanced with the development of a profit-driven and competitive efficient market — what regulatory democratic institutions must do to promote the efficient allocation of resources with good, transparent and accountable governance., governance norms, if properly enforced, can enable india to grow at 12 per cent a year by efficiently using the current 36 per cent rate of investment — by reducing the current incremental capital output ratio from 4.0 to 3.0. this implies a 36 divided by 3 per cent growth rate in gdp, or 12 per cent a year, which will mean a doubling of gdp every 72 divided by 12 years, or just six years, and that of per capita income doubling every seven years. this growth rate can take us to the league of the top three nations of the world, of the u.s., china and india, by 2020 and help overtake china in the next two decades thence. that should be the goal of governance for us today., india is not yet an economically developed nation. while it has demonstrated prowess in it software, biotech and pharmaceuticals, accelerated its growth rate to 9 per cent a year to become the third largest nation in terms of gdp at ppp rates, it still has a backward agricultural sector hosting 62 per cent of the people of india. farmers are committing suicide unable to repay their loans, the national unemployment rate is over 15 per cent of the adult labour force, and there is prevalence of child labour arising out of nearly 50 per cent of the children not making it to school beyond the fifth standard. the country has a deeply malfunctioning primary and secondary educational system, 300 million illiterates and 250 million people in dire poverty. india’s infrastructure is pathetic, with frequent electric power breakdowns even in metropolitan cities, dangerously unhealthy water supply in urban areas, galloping hiv infections, and gaping holes on the national highways., to become a developed country, india’s gdp will have to grow at 12 per cent a year for at least a decade. technically this is within india’s reach, since it would require the rate of investment to rise from the present 28 per cent of gdp to 36 per cent while productivity growth will have to ensure that the incremental output — capital ratio declines from the present 4.0 to 3.0. these are modest goals that can be attained by increased fdi and by use of it software in domestic industry., need for more reforms, but for that to happen, more vigorous market-centric economic reforms to dismantle the vestiges of the soviet model in indian planning, especially at the provincial level, are required. the indian financial system also suffers from a hangover of cronyism and corruption that have brought government budgets to the verge of bankruptcy. this too needs fixing., india’s infrastructure requires about $150 billion to make it world-class, while the education system needs 6 per cent of gdp instead of 2.8 per cent today. but an open competitive market system can find these resources, provided the quality of governance and accountability is improved. obviously, a second generation of reforms is necessary for all this., but reforms are urgently required to be carried out to accelerate india’s growth rate to 12 per cent a year. india has many advantages today for achieving a booming economy: a demographic dividend, an agriculture that has internationally the lowest yield in land and livestock-based products, and also at the lowest cost of production, a full 12 months a year of farm-friendly weather, a highly competitive skilled labour force and low wage rates at the national level, the advantages of which have already been proved to the world by the outsourcing phenomenon. we have a young population (average is 28 years compared to the 38 years of the u.s., and japan’s 49 years) that can be the base for it by ushering in innovation in our production process., since the worldview of economic development has now completely changed, economic development is no more thought of as capital-driven but as knowledge-driven. for application of knowledge, we need innovations. this means more original research, which needs more fresh young minds— the cream of the youth — to be imbued with learning and placed at the frontier of research., instead, for decades since independence we had been told that india’s demography was its main liability, that india’s population was growing too fast, and what india needed most was to control its population, even if by coercive methods.",0.0917454954954955,economic agenda india 2020,"setting 2020 perspective economic agenda india requires clarity framework within economic policy choices made. wide global consensus today

can we use it to stimulate skill employment not of the urban nature as it is not possible? we need to introduce flexibility in the act,” mr. ramesh said., “so inherent in the design of this programme is an impossible dilemma. so some trade offs have to be made in the future programme,” he added., terming migration as “inherent in employment strategy” which creates a whole set of social and political issues, mr. ramesh said it has been very clear to him that his ministry can never provide jobs in the areas where youth want them., “we are not going to be able to create all the jobs in that state and it has to be outside but then we run into a whole set of social barriers,” he added., “we should encourage migration. we should not put any barriers to migration. we should utilise this opportunity to put in place a set of policy that removes discrimination against migrants,” mr. ramesh said., elaborating about his ministry’s programme of running special employment programme for unemployed youth in jammu and kashmir, mr. ramesh said that 60 per cent of the jobs that were being provided were outside j&k., “one of the problems which we are facing is discrimination in housing market... landlords do not want to give houses to youths from j&k for a variety of reasons. this is a very serious structural issue,” he said., asked where would jobs come from, mr. ramesh said before he started special employment programmes, he was not very enthusiastic on retail but now has been convinced that the jobs are coming in retail., he said that in j&k, the bulk of employment “which we are creating is in organised retail as well as for the tribal youths who are also going in that sector“., “we should not close the door on organised manufacturing .... i was not somebody who was in favour of fdi in retail but when i see the amount of jobs that are being created, i think it will be foolish to close the doors on this,” mr. ramesh., he was however critical of contract labour. mr. ramesh said that in his own office there was contract labour and the hassles associated with contract labour are less than that of formal labour and that is one of the reasons why government is now resorting to contract labour, which is unfair., “wages don’t get paid on time. i have to call up contractor to ensure that young ladies working in my office actually get paid. sometimes they get paid once in three four months. we cannot turn the clock back on contract labour,” he said., “...indians always will find ways to bypass laws. i am sure the industrial disputes act, people have done ‘jugad’ on it. all other forms of unionisation are deterrants to quick adjudgements. it’s not retrenchment which people are wanting...,” he added.",0.04498487946162365,"nrega needs flexibility , objectives met states : ramesh","union minister rural development , jairam ramesh. file photo : s. subramanium &#124; photo credit : s_subramanium , batting bringing flexibility upa ’ flagship nrega , union minister jairam ramesh sunday said scheme failed achieve three objectives wage employment , creating community assets empowering gram panchayats time state. , stating jobs cannot provided areas youths want , called encouraging migration across states noted concern “discrimination ” housing suffered youths jammu kashmir employed outside state. , said need put place policy removes discrimination migrants said “trade offs ” made future programme. , “there three objectives nrega. first provide wage employment , second create durable community assets third empower gram panchayats. states nrega successful , two three objectives fulfilled. states , three objectives fulfilled , ” rural development minister said. , speaking event unveil indian labour employment report - 2014. , giving examples , mr. ramesh said andhra pradesh , pace setter nrega , provided wage employment durable assets , simply bypassed locally elected gram panchayats. , north indian states like madhya pradesh rajasthan , gram panchayats empowered , wage employment created community assets visible , said. , “at end six years , important us pause little ask use nrega next phase ?

2013-12-17,keep the movement burning,"did the citizens of delhi read party manifestos before they voted? if they had studied all of that and then set out for the polling booth, the results may well have been different. the aam aadmi party (aap) could have come a distant third: a david crunched by two goliaths. if truth be told, the congress probably had a better programme on paper than the other two, but look what happened to it., the reason the bharatiya janata party (bjp) did well was because the electorate had had enough of the congress. the reason why the aap did well was because, once again, people had had enough of the congress. in both cases, where was the manifesto?, how then did these two parties fatten themselves by devouring the same animal? simply by dividing the spoils without a well- thought-out recipe. the bjp bit into chunks from the north west, south and southwest delhi, leaving the heart of the capital to be savaged by the aap. the rich, the poor and the middle class spread their favours equally among the three contenders, which shows, once again, that manifestos did not count., is the aap now overcooking its goose by thrusting a manifesto-like document on us? that is indeed what it looks like as one goes through its long-winded 18-point set of preconditions for allying with the congress. the many details in it have surprised a number of aap activists and robbed the organisation of its stir-fried crispiness. aap supporters, in the main, did not vote for neighbourhood committees, or for blocking fdi in retail, or for regularising unauthorised colonies either. rarely did an aap voter think of any of these at election time, so why bring them up now? the day is not yet done., yet, by putting these out as inalienable must-do items, the aap is forcing its support base to do a think, perhaps even a rethink. from the beginning till election day, what mr. kejriwal’s followers wanted most was a regime free of vips and corruption. in their view, the two were interlinked by definition. hence, if one went, so would the other. this is why the jan lokpal bill escaped voters’ scrutiny and remained, for all practical purposes, a pie in the sky., the anger against vip swagger figures elsewhere too, but never with the same ferocity as it does in delhi. politicians collude to make the capital their fiefdom, converting citizens to subjects, and corruption to a way of life. this is the culture that aap supporters wanted out, which is why they turned up in such large numbers and with so much enthusiasm. they were certainly not charged up by the idea of street corner huddles taking policy decisions, or giving “swaraj” to delhi, or rejigging vat., on issues such as these, the ordinary aap enthusiast is uncertain, often even unsupportive. by forcing these divisive matters to the front, the party is placing itself on the skids for no good reason. the congress and the bjp have so far kept quiet about taking a fresh view on anything and, wisely so. they probably know, by instinct, never to force a manifesto in the open for that only troubles settled waters. yet, the aap has gone ahead and done just that; keeping things simple suddenly looks very complicated indeed., if its intention was to set preconditions that would put the congress and the bjp off, there was a better way of achieving this. all it had to do was to stick to the basics: oppose vip culture and doodle with the idea of a lokpal bill. its biggest appeal lay in its promise of a “no-frill” government where ministers walk with the people, out in the open. no politician from the congress, or the bjp, or any other party for that matter, would ever countenance such a nightmare world without privileges. the threat of becoming ordinary mortals without security, without bungalows, without motorcades, would be enough to leave them sleepless., perhaps its eagerness to go in for the kill has made the aap overzealous for a quick second election. no doubt, its suitors are black-hearted, but by saying “no” in 18 different ways it has lost some of its boy-next-door appeal. word might go around that mr. kejriwal either fears a commitment or fears an inability to perform. these doubts would not have surfaced had the aap pruned its 18 points to just, maybe, three or four. that way it would have kept its youthful good looks for another day., after all, what made the difference in 2013 is that unlike the 2008 polls, young voters came out in large numbers from both the poor and posh quarters of delhi. five years ago, the new delhi constituency had a very low voter turnout, but not this time. it is here that mr. kejriwal trounced ms sheila dixit by over 26,000 votes. not just that, in neighbouring greater kailash, the aap shamed the bjp from what was considered to be its safest seat in the city. in r.k. puram, it lost by a mere 326 votes; it was that close!, none of this could have happened had not the 2013 delhi election been visited by a “movement” in the shape of the aap. it is this that turned a staid voting scenario to a turbulent and carnivalesque one. a three per cent margin held it back from being in complete power, but it had made even cynics sit up and take notice. it was the movement, the mobilisation, the big agenda of anti-corruption that was everything., this is why it is too early yet for mr. kejriwal to step out of the movement’s skin and get weighed under by the nitty-gritty. he must hammer away at his promise to deliver just one spectacular thing and not 18 dull, but potentially divisive, ones. only then can he keep the aap’s elan alive and halt it from becoming a humdrum party; an also-ran., in the ultimate analysis, it may even be better for the aap to form the government for that is really a low-risk option. if the congress, at some point, were to withdraw support, kejriwal and company could go to the voters with an “i-told-you-so.” it would make it that much easier to demonstrate that the bjp and the congress are indeed in cahoots and resentful of a clean government.",0.06038071517523574,keep movement burning,"citizens delhi read party manifestos voted ?

2013-12-19,welfare policies & electoral outcomes,"three propositions dominate explanations of the congress party’s rout, the bharatiya janata party’s impressive victory and the aam aadmi party’s stunning success in delhi in the recent assembly elections. one, that there is a strong anti-congress wave in the country owing to pervasive anger with its record in power, especially corruption and rising prices, two, that it is a vote against its approach to governance, an approach that relies heavily on social legislation and centrally sponsored welfare schemes, and three, that the congress’s secularism has lost its vigour because people have moved on to other issues, namely “development.”, the party’s poor showing in this round of assembly elections is certainly an indication of a sharp change in the national mood which has turned against it in the run-up to the 2014 parliamentary election. while the four states are not representative of the rest of india, yet the results are very largely a verdict against the congress-dominated united progressive alliance (upa) government at the centre. the upa has been widely punished for rampant corruption, inflation and policy drifts neutralising to a large extent the regime’s previous big achievement of striking a balance between economic growth and social welfare. the strong public sentiment against the congress and an ensuing anti-congressism building up across different contexts and states portends its imminent decline and loss of power in delhi., the congress rout has led some analysts to argue that india is entering a new era in which the identity politics and issues of mass deprivation and inequality don’t matter; social welfare policies don’t any longer influence electoral outcomes. the party’s wash out is a warning against an electoral strategy that relies heavily on “populism” and “freebies” — two terms that have increasingly become a staple of the indian news media. in short, the congress is paying the price for building an expansive welfare state, rather than pursuing reforms to boost higher growth. they have questioned the relevance of welfare policies particularly in the context of rajasthan where the congress suffered huge losses despite an array of welfare schemes., the wide-ranging critique of welfare policies is puzzling because india has enacted far fewer social policies than one would expect from such a poor, democratic country. india’s social policy expenditures on health and education — both as percentages of national income and as per capita spending have significantly lagged behind those of its more developmentalist neighbours in east and south east asia and fall well short of the recommended norm of six per cent. with regard to social protection spending in asia, india ranked in the bottom half of the 35 countries recently surveyed by the asian development bank. so, all this uproar against social welfare programmes seems somewhat misplaced., certainly, the congress under sonia gandhi’s leadership has given priority to the social welfare and rights-based approach to development. while the growth model has seen no change during the upa rule, there was recognition that serious imbalances between growth and distribution needed to be addressed through some redistributive measures. thus, the government went on to shape a new form of welfare politics through a host of rights-based legislation, the most important being the right to employment, the right to food and the right to education. this has raised the hackles of two powerful forces — the corporate sector and middle classes — who feel that these policies have gone too far, especially with the enactment of the national food security act (nfsa). the public debate over the nfsa highlights this phenomenon. the criticism revolved around the idea that resources are being wasted on populist policies and subsidies, wilfully oblivious to the fact that the elite and middle classes have managed to capture public resources often at the cost of the poor., for sure, social welfare policies are driven by electoral interests. on balance, the congress coalition came to power in 2004 largely on the strength of the promise to guarantee work. it retained power five years later by extending and deepening social spending and enacting rights-based legislation. these policies have won the support of the poor and the marginalised that form its core constituency. of late, the congress has placed greater emphasis on these policies in the hope of differentiating itself sharply from the bjp. in fact, mr. narendra modi’s rise has led the congress to further sharpen its identity as a party of the underprivileged. but it has failed to protect the interests of its core constituency, especially with regard to inflation which hurts them the most. nothing illustrates this more starkly than the irony of the congress pushing pro-big business policies giving rise to crony capitalism and economic reforms such as fdi in retail, even as the corporate sector and middle classes are unforgiving in their disapproval of the upa regime., noticeably absent from these accounts has been the role of welfare policies in the re-election of bjp governments in madhya pradesh and chhattisgarh. the electoral effects of welfare measures were obvious in madhya pradesh, where chief minister shivraj singh chouhan sought a renewed mandate on the basis of a series of social welfare schemes and within minutes of the swearing-in as chief minister, he launched some more schemes with an eye on the general election. likewise in chhattisgarh, chief minister raman singh banked on the revamped public distribution system and food subsidies to win votes. but there is no disparagement of these subsidies and schemes perhaps because those who have led the charge against social welfare policies regard them as examples of good governance by a party of the right.",0.08529750391452516,welfare policies &amp;

2014-01-04,telangana: no constitutional barriers,"now that the proposal for a new telangana state has entered the legislative stage, in the state assembly and subsequently parliament, the constitutional question will take centre stage: does the absence of a supporting state assembly resolution for the creation of a new telangana state, an outcome which remains likely, render a parliamentary amendment unconstitutional? in this essay i show that this constitutional question sits at the fault lines of two conflicting constitutional impulses on federalism in india: first, the imperative of crafting an accommodating state-nation and second, to guard against the excesses of venal partisan federalism. on balance, i conclude that the absence of a state assembly resolution is not a constitutional barrier to the creation of telangana. we must preserve the union power to redraw state boundaries unfettered by new constitutional restraints, imposed either by the president or the supreme court, as the flexibility to create suitable state-nation arrangements has sustained indian federalism and political unity., the constitutional legal argument against the creation of telangana rests on the claim that a state assembly to which the president refers a bill to alter state boundaries under the proviso to article 3 must consent to this proposal for it to be constitutionally valid. as has been pointed out in the opinion columns of this paper, this argument faces a significant hurdle. the supreme court has repeatedly clarified that while the state assembly’s resolution is an important procedural requirement under article 3, a negative vote or a failure to vote on the referred bill does not impose substantive constraints on the union power to enact such legislation., in babulal parate (1959) a five-judge constitutional bench of the supreme court confronted the political jostling around the status of bombay in maharashtra and gujarat. the president had referred a bill to the state assembly, which proposed a three-way split between gujarat, maharashtra and a union territory of bombay. after the state assembly approved this bill, it was amended by parliament to include bombay within the state of maharashtra — a not so insignificant change! despite the significant unilateral alteration by parliament, the supreme court concluded that this was not a sufficient reason to strike down the union law as the states had no rights under the indian constitution. this view of the role of state legislatures where state boundaries are altered has been reaffirmed recently in pradeep chaudhary (2009) where the final union law creating uttaranchal state included the entire haridwar district while the one approved by the state assembly included only haridwar city. hence, we are in no doubt that even if the andhra pradesh legislative assembly rejects or refuses to pass this resolution, this will not be a constitutional barrier to the creation of the telangana state unless the supreme court changes its interpretation of article 3., hence, the constitutional argument against the creation of the telangana state is not about what the law is but what it should be. there is nothing in the text of the proviso to article 3 to indicate that parliament must accept or act upon the views of the state legislature. further justification for such a view should be understood to be the result of the embrace of a particular type of federalism: a holding-together federalism that adopts state-nation strategies. in babulal parate, the court observed that: “none of the constituent units of the indian union was sovereign and independent in the sense the american colonies or the swiss cantons were before they formed their federal unions. the constituent assembly of india, deriving its power from the sovereign people, was unfettered by any previous commitment in evolving a constitutional pattern suitable to the genius and requirements of the indian people as a whole. unlike some other federal legislatures, parliament, representing the people of india as a whole, has been vested with the exclusive power of admitting or establishing new states, increasing or diminishing the area of an existing state or altering its boundaries, the legislature or legislatures of the states concerned having only the right to an expression of views on the proposals.” as stepan, linz and yadav show, in a federation of this type, the union’s capacity to shape state boundaries to respond to claims for political autonomy based on linguistic, ethnic, religious or tribal identities has arguably strengthened the capacity of the indian federation to endure over the last 60 years. any attempt, by the president or the supreme court, to constrain this union power with new constitutional or political limitations may have a lasting impact on the future of the indian federation., however, it appears that the state-nation and holding together federalism justification for the union power to create new states does not take the problem of political partisanship seriously enough. as many commentators have argued, the congress party may well be endorsing the telangana state to secure partisan electoral gains. so should the president of india or the courts intervene to craft neutral constitutional rules that prevent the federal constitutional arrangements being exploited for partisan political considerations?, in the last three decades, the supreme court has intervened in at least three types of disputes to craft neutral constitutional rules that prevent partisan federalism: proclamation of regional emergencies or president’s rule under article 356; appointment of governors and their exercise of executive power and to prevent the abuse of union executive power to preserve law and order in the states. despite the court’s intervention, partisan federalism has become ubiquitous in indian constitutional culture. in the last decade, on almost every issue on which federalism has been invoked by the states, it has been by parties in opposition to those at the union government: the ostensibly federal division on the gst, nia, cbi power, lok pal bill, fdi in retail or the communal violence bill is better explained by opposition party control over state units. however, we must be careful in characterising federalism in india as inexorably partisan in character, particularly in the realm of new state creation.",0.07391173641173641,telangana : constitutional barriers,"proposal new telangana state entered legislative

2014-04-25,a new economic agenda,"the question before a probable narendra modi-led government in 2014 is whether the statistically undeniable economic slide of the last decade can be halted and a fresh impetus be given to growth in the indian economy., the answer is “yes” if good governance norms are properly enforced to enable the indian economy to grow at 12 per cent per year in gdp for a decade which means efficiently deploying resources to reduce the current incremental capital output ratio from 4.0 to 3.0, and by incentivising the people to save more to increase the current rate of investment (which is domestic saving plus net foreign investment)., the united progressive alliance (upa) government, judged statistically by the dangerous level of fiscal and capital accounts deficit indicators, has squandered national financial and physical resources mainly due to a lack of accountability, corruption and high transaction costs arising for archaic bureaucratic procedures., this picture emerges from comparative statistics of national democratic alliance (1998-2004) and upa (2004-2014) rule., efficient, corruption-free deployment of existing resources that implies a reduction in the capital-output ratio, means a 12 per cent gdp growth rate per year, i.e., a doubling of gdp every six years, and that of per capita income doubling every seven years., this growth rate over a five-year period can take us into the league of the top three most populated nations of the world, i.e., of the united states, china and india — that is by 2020. thereafter, india would be able to overtake china over the next decade. that should be the goal of governance for us today., india is not yet an economically developed nation. india has demonstrated its prowess in the it, biotech and pharmaceutical sectors and has accelerated its growth rate to nine per cent per year in the first decade of this century, up from an earlier 40-year (1950-90) socialist era average annual growth rate of a mere 3.5 per cent, to become the third largest nation in terms of gdp at purchasing power parity (ppp) rates., however, it still has a backward agricultural sector of 62 per cent of the people, where there are farmer suicides because of inability to repay loans. there is a national unemployment rate that is of over 15 per cent of the adult labour force, a prevalence of child labour arising out of nearly 50 per cent of children not making it to school beyond standard five, a deeply malfunctioning primary and secondary educational system, and 300 million illiterates and 250 million people in dire poverty., india’s infrastructure is pathetic, with frequent electric power breakdowns even in metropolitan cities, dangerously unhealthy water supply in urban areas, a galloping rate of hiv infection, and gaping potholes that dot our national highways., to become a developed country, therefore, india’s gdp will have to grow at 12 per cent per year for at least a decade. technically this is within india’s reach, since it would require the rate of investment to rise from the present 28 per cent of gdp to 36 per cent, while productivity growth will have to ensure that the incremental output-capital ratio declines from the present 4.0 to 3.0., these are modest goals that can be attained by an efficient decision-making structure, tackling corruption, increased foreign direct investment (fdi) and use of it software in the domestic industry. but for that to happen, what is required are more vigorous market-centric economic reforms to dismantle the remaining vestiges of the soviet model in indian planning, especially at the provincial level., the indian financial system also suffers from a hangover of cronyism and corruption which has left government budgets on the verge of bankruptcy. this too needs fixing. it cannot be rectified by a reserve bank of india vitiating the investment climate with an obsession to contain inflationary pressure. it is like killing a patient to lower his body temperature., india’s infrastructure requires about $150 billion to make it world class, while a new innovation climate requires investment in the education system of six per cent of gdp instead of 2.8 per cent today. but an open competitive market system can find these resources provided the quality of governance and accountability is improved. auctioning of natural resources such as spectrum, coal, oilfields, and land for commercial exploitation can largely substitute for tax impositions. obviously, a wide-ranging second generation of reforms is necessary for all this to accelerate india’s growth rate to 12 per cent per year. india has many advantages today to achieve a booming economy. we have a young population (an average of 28 years compared to the u.s.’ 38 years, and japan’s 49 years) that could be the base for it to usher in innovation in our production process (a demographic dividend); an agriculture sector that has internationally the lowest yield in land and livestock-based products, and also, at the lowest cost of production, a full 12 months a year of farm-friendly weather, and an internationally competitive, skilled and low wage rate, semi-skilled labour at the national level. the advantages are already being proved to the world by the outsourcing phenomenon of skills in the developed world and the cheap supply of labour to oil-rich countries., since the world view of economic development has now completely changed, economic development is no more thought of as being capital-driven, but knowledge-driven instead., for application of knowledge, we need innovations, which means more original research which in turn needs more fresh young minds — the cream of the youth — to be imbibed with learning and at the frontier of research., for decades since independence in 1947 we had been told that india’s demography was its main liability, that india’s population was growing too fast, and what india needed most was to control its population, even if by coercive methods., globally, india today leads in the supply of youth, i.e., persons in the age group of 15 to 35 years, and this lead will last for another 40 years. therefore, we should not squander away this “natural resource.” we must, by proper policy for the young, realise and harvest this demographic potential.",0.06641462241462243,new economic

2014-05-26,a window of opportunity,"india’s weak economic performance, the 2008 financial crisis and the economic downturn in the united states have all diminished the >india-u.s. relationship in recent years, after the two countries had come a long way together since the 1950s. when i arrived in philadelphia in early april, prof. surjit mansingh — once an indian foreign service officer and now teaching at the american university — ruefully said, “nothing can be expected from a u.s. government that has relegated south asia, india included, to the strategic unimportance it had during the cold war.” while the two governments remained somewhat somnambulant, business and industry leaders and the indian-american community, the other drivers of the relationship, became dormant too. extricating it from the depth it has sunk will be no easy task., consonance of interests post-election, there has been a visible change in the outlook of experts on india within think tanks, universities and the beltway in washington dc. there is a sense that india’s destiny depends not just on economic progress; it also needs governance that has a social vocation, public institutions that are accountable, and a society that is tolerant and secular. from prime minister narendra modi’s statements, they hope he might turn out to be different from how he has been portrayed by the opposition. they believe it is time to re-engage with an india that is energised, self-confident, and which will grow faster under a new government., on his part, mr. modi has set aside the personal affront of his visa blacklisting. declaring that national interest is higher than individuals, he has committed himself to >work for improved india-u.s. ties. he fought the election on an agenda of development, for which india needs markets, investments and technology. for india, the u.s. remains the prime source of all three., geo-strategically, some of the big issues that confront the u.s. today, china, pakistan, and the shaping of the post-2014 transition in afghanistan, all happen to be in india’s periphery. a more rapid expansion of india’s economy can accelerate the creation of a common economic space in south asia. such an india can better contribute to the design of the currently absent security architecture in asia and the indo-pacific. india’s contribution to stabilising the subcontinent, underwriting its integration and development through its own growth, and investment in building regional infrastructure and connectivity, as also india’s growing role in protecting maritime routes in the indian ocean, all benefit the u.s too., defence preparedness besides the economy, india’s focus externally will be on improving relations with the contiguous countries, including china. given our experience since independence, this also requires better defence preparedness, for which the relationship with the u.s. will be critical in the years ahead., so far, india’s major military platforms, including some still being developed, have come from russia. the two countries have enjoyed a special relationship for several decades and this must be preserved and nurtured. the inept u.s. handling of its ties with russia has cemented sino-russian strategic relations in a way that india’s preferential customer status of russian defence supplies is now imperilled. india might not be able to rely indefinitely on exclusive or favoured treatment from russia vis-à-vis china., during his just concluded visit to beijing, russian president vladimir putin said russia-china relations were “at the highest level in history.” the skovorodino-mohe pipeline project worth over $60 billion in investment, and nearly half a trillion dollars in overall value over three decades, is about to roll. in his phone-in-interview on april 17, available on his website, president putin said russia and china are neighbours and “allies,” and that, with china, russia has “never had such trust based relations in the military industry.” earlier, this year, kommersant, a moscow trade paper reported that mr. putin had given his assent for a deal to sell china — over the objections of his general staff — the state-of-the-art s-400 missile system, capable of shooting down all “enemy aerial targets that are known today.” talks are at an advanced stage for sale of su-35 fighter aircraft to china. meanwhile, russia itself is buying higher quality military platforms, such as the mistral helicopter carriers from france., india might, therefore, need to diversify its defence procurement further. on offer from the u.s, among other equipment, is the ‘javelin,’ said to be among the best available crew fired anti-tank weaponry, as also the co-development and manufacture of the next generation of such missiles, long-range surface-to-air missiles, and the next generation naval gun. an even more pressing need for india is to raise the level of technology domestication in the defence industry, for which a tweaking of the offset policy and increasing the cap on foreign direct investment (fdi) in defence to nurture joint ventures might lead to a breakthrough in an area that have confounded india’s efforts at indigenisation so far., another area where >constructive india-u.s. ties will have a positive impact is on india’s other external relationships. until 15 years ago, india-u.s. exchanges were confined largely to bilateral issues. when on the americas desk in the ministry of external affairs (mea) between 2001 and 2004, i saw the start of multiple india-u.s. dialogues, on east asia, the rise of china, the association of southeast asian nations (asean) and indonesia, the situation in the gulf and the middle east, and a range of multilateral and global issues. other great powers quickly took notice and followed suit by pursuing similar conversations., as the india-u.s. relationship gathered momentum, and an accord with the u.s. on peaceful uses of nuclear energy began taking shape, not perhaps as a consequence of but certainly as a sequel to it — there has been a spate of small successes in india’s interactions internationally. a case in point is the agreement with china in 2005 on the “political parameters and guiding principles for the settlement of the india-china boundary question.” it was arguably the sole, significant success of the 17th round of talks of the special representatives negotiating the india-china boundary. this came when india’s global importance was at a high point, with flourishing relations with russia, the u.s., the european union, key european countries, and the start of warming relations with japan. that traction in india’s external engagement was lost concurrently with india-u.s. relations losing steam, especially over the past five years., the instruments of revival for a revival in relations, the onus is on the u.s. side. the challenge would be how to do it. mr. modi has had the least contact with u.s. leaders, compared to those of russia, china and japan, and not of his own volition. >u.s president barack obama has reached out to mr. modi by doing what other world leaders have done, but that is not enough., the right mechanics must be harnessed in cranking up a cold motor — for starters, a new u.s. ambassador in new delhi. it appears that the eminent personalities who have been sounded out, such as the u.s. exim bank chairman/president, fred hochberg, do not want it with a lame duck presidency behind them. as of now, there is more than an even chance that in the coming congressional elections, the republicans will gain a narrow majority in the senate, foreclosing presidential initiatives that do not have bipartisan

2014-06-09,"address by the president of india, shri pranab mukherjee to parliament","president pranab mukherjee, prime minister narendra modi. lok sabha speaker sumitra mahajan and parliamentary affairs minister venkiah naidu on thier way to address the joint session of parliament house in new delhi on monday. photo: r.v.moorthy , central hall of parliament, new delhi: 09-06-2014, honourable members, i am delighted to address this >first session of both houses of parliament after the elections to the 16th lok sabha. let me begin by extending warm greetings to my fellow citizens, who participated in large numbers in the recently concluded lok sabha elections. we should never forget that we are here because of them. serving them should be our first priority. i also felicitate the members of the new lok sabha. you have successfully obtained the mandate from the electorate and now you represent their hopes, aspirations and dreams. i extend a warm welcome to all of you and hope that the sessions ahead with heavy legislative agenda will be productive and useful., 2.it is a matter of great satisfaction that the recent general elections were smooth and largely peaceful. i would like to congratulate the election commission of india and the official machinery for conducting these elections successfully. the unprecedented interest shown by the people of india in the elections is a sign of progressive deepening of our vibrant democracy. before i dwell upon the tasks ahead of us, i would like to express my solidarity with the families of all those who lost their lives during the election process., 3.i congratulate the new speaker of the lok sabha on her unanimous election to this august office. by successively electing women speakers, the lok sabha has re-affirmed our age-old belief in the importance of women in our society., honourable members, 4.this has been an election of hope. it marks a turning point in the evolution of our democratic polity. the surge in aspirations and the belief that these could be realized through democratic processes, has been amply reflected in the record 66.4% participation by voters, and a clear verdict in favour of a single political party after a gap of nearly 30 years. the electorate transcended the boundaries of caste, creed, region and religion to come together and vote decisively in favour of development through good governance., 5.the country needed a strong and stable government that could provide effective leadership. in my republic day speech earlier this year, i had hoped for 2014 to be a year of healing after the fractured and contentious politics of the previous years. standing here today, i applaud the wisdom of my fellow citizens for having voted for stability, honesty and development in a resurgent india in which corruption will have no place. they have voted for a united, strong, and modern india - “ek bharat - shreshtha bharat”. my government will work to fulfill these aspirations; with the involvement of all the 125 crore people of this great country., 6.my government is committed to nurturing the right environment for actualizing this mandate of the people. for this, it pledges itself to the principle of ‘sabka saath, sabka vikas’; which can be fulfilled only through your active participation. we will work together to re-establish the credibility of the institutions of democracy. my government will function on the mantra of ‘minimum government, maximum governance’. in all our actions, we will be guided by the core values of our great civilization., honourable members, 7.my government is dedicated to the poor. poverty has no religion, hunger has no creed, and despair has no geography. the greatest challenge before us is to end the curse of poverty in india. my government will not be satisfied with mere “poverty alleviation”; and commits itself to the goal of “poverty elimination”. with a firm belief that the first claim on development belongs to the poor; the government will focus its attention on those who need the basic necessities of life most urgently. it will take necessary steps to provide security in its entirety to all citizens; through empathy, support and empowerment., 8.containing food inflation will be the topmost priority for my government. there would be an emphasis on improving the supply side of various agro and agro-based products. my government will take effective steps to prevent hoarding and black marketing. it will reform the public distribution system, incorporating best practices from the states. my government is alert about the possibility of a subnormal monsoon this year and contingency plans are being prepared., 9.despite more than two-thirds of our people living in rural areas; we have not been able to provide adequate public amenities and livelihood opportunities to them. my government is committed to improving the quality of life in our villages, through empowered panchayati raj institutions. a substantial part of investment will focus on creating community assets and improving basic infrastructure such as roads, shelter, power and drinking water. my government will strive to end the rural-urban divide guided by the idea of rurban; providing urban amenities to rural areas while preserving the ethos of the villages., 10.agriculture is the source of livelihood for majority of our people. in the recent past, our farmers have been under severe stress with hopelessness driving some of them to suicides. my government is committed to reversing this unfortunate trend. it will increase investment in agriculture, both public and private, especially in agri-infrastructure. steps will be taken to convert farming into a profitable venture through scientific practices and agro-technology. my government will address issues pertaining to pricing and procurement of agricultural produce, crop insurance and post-harvest management. productivity of animal husbandry will be increased. my government will incentivize the setting up of food processing industries. existing cooperative sector laws will be reviewed to remove anomalies and lacunae. my government will adopt a national land use policy which will facilitate scientific identification of non-cultivable land and its strategic development., 11.each drop of water is precious. my government is committed to giving high priority to water security. it will complete the long pending irrigation projects on priority and launch the ‘pradhan mantri krishi sinchayee yojana’ with the motto of ‘har khet ko paani’. there is a need for seriously considering all options including linking of rivers, where feasible; for ensuring optimal use of our water resources to prevent the recurrence of floods and drought. by harnessing rain water through ‘jal sanchay’ and ‘jal sinchan’, we will nurture water conservation and ground water recharge. micro irrigation will be popularised to ensure ‘per drop-more crop’., honourable members, 12.india is the world’s oldest civilization. today it is also a country with the largest population of the youth. we must equip and nurture our youth with the right kind of education, skill-set and opportunity to reap this demographic dividend. my government will strive to transition from youth development to youth-led development. it will set up massive open online courses and virtual classrooms. it will formulate a national education policy aimed at meeting the challenges posed by lack of quality, research and innovation in our educational institutions. we will set up iits and iims in every state. in order to empower school teachers and students, a national e-library will be established. with the motto of “har haath ko hunar”, my government will strive to break the barriers between formal education and skill development, and put in place a mechanism to give academic equivalence to vocational qualifications. with the goal of skilled india, my government will also launch a national multi-skill mission., 13. the children and youth of the country need avenues of recreation that develop them constructively and keep them fit. my government will launch a ‘national sports talent search system’. it will facilitate development and promotion of indian sports, particularly rural sports. sports will be popularised by making it an integral part of the school curriculum and providing educational incentives., 14.our country needs a holistic health care system that is universally accessible, affordable and effective. to achieve this objective, my government will formulate a new health policy and roll out a national health assurance mission. it will promote yoga and ayush. to address the shortfall of health care professionals, health education and training will be transformed. aiims like institutes will be established in every state in a phased manner., 15.we must not tolerate the indignity of homes without toilets and public spaces littered with garbage. for ensuring hygiene, waste management and sanitation across the nation a “swachh bharat mission” will be launched. this will be our tribute to mahatma gandhi on his 150th birth anniversary to be celebrated in the year 2019., 16.keeping in mind welfare of the people belonging to the scheduled castes, scheduled tribes, other backward classes and the weaker sections of our society; my government will take steps to create an enabling eco-system of equal opportunity in education, health and livelihood. my government is committed to see that those belonging to the scheduled castes and other backward classes are able to avail emerging opportunities. for the scheduled tribes, my government will launch a dedicated “van bandhu kalyan yojana”. electrification of tribal hamlets and connecting them with all-weather roads will be a priority area., 17.it is unfortunate that even after several decades of independence, sections of minority communities continue to suffer from poverty, as benefits of government schemes do not reach them. my government is committed to making all minorities equal partners in india’s progress. the government will especially strengthen measures to spread modern and technical education among minority communities and a national madarsa modernization programme will be initiated., 18.the welfare and rehabilitation of specially-abled people is integral to my government’s vision of a caring society. it will take steps to provide dignity of life to them by facilitating their participation in all walks of life. steps will be taken to identify their special needs and to provide institutional care to them., 19.my government recognizes the important role our women play in the development of our society and growth of the nation. it is committed to providing 33 per cent reservation to them in the parliament and state legislative assemblies. with a commitment of “beti bachao - beti padhao”, my government will launch a mass campaign for saving the girl child and enabling her education. it will structure a comprehensive scheme, incorporating best practices from states in this regard. in the recent past, the country has witnessed some grue some incidents of violence against women. the government will have a policy of zero tolerance for violence against women, and will strengthen the criminal justice system for its effective implementation., honourable members, 20.india is a federal polity. but, over the years, the federal spirit has been diluted. the states and the centre should function as an organic team india. in order to actively engage with the states on national issues, my government will reinvigorate fora like the national development council and the inter-state council. the centre will be an enabler in the rapid progress of states through cooperative federalism. state-specific development models will be developed taking into account the special needs and unique problems of coastal, hilly and desert areas. highest priority will be accorded to bring eastern region of the country on par with western region in terms of physical and social infrastructure. my government is committed to addressing the issues relating to development of andhra pradesh and telangana. the government will lay special emphasis on improving the intra-region connectivity and border infrastructure in the northeast as well as in jammu & kashmir. the issue of infiltration and illegal immigrants in the northeast region will be tackled on priority and all pending fencing work along the northeast border will be completed. special efforts will be made to ensure that kashmiri pandits return to the land of their ancestors with full dignity, security and assured livelihood., 21.my government is committed to providing a clean and efficient administration focussed on delivery. the institution of lok pal is important to curb corruption and my government will endeavour to formulate rules in conformity with the act. my government will take steps to build the confidence and morale of our bureaucracy; enabling it with the freedom to work, and welcoming innovative ideas. the government will stress on putting in place transparent systems and timebound delivery of government services. government systems and processes will be revisited to make them citizen friendly, corruption free and accountable. efforts will be made to eliminate obsolete laws, regulations, administrative structures and practices. rationalization and convergence among ministries, departments and other arms of the government will be ensured to have focussed delivery. digitization of government records will be done for improving accessibility., 22.e-governance brings empowerment, equity and efficiency. it has the power to transform peoples’ lives. the backbone of my government’s new ways of working will be a digital india. it will be used to drive re-engineering of government processes to improve service delivery and programme implementation. we will strive to provide wi-fi zones in critical public areas in the next five years. my government will rollout broad band highway to reach every village and make all schools e-enabled in a phased manner. technology will be used to prepare our children for a knowledge society. the national e-governance plan will be expanded to cover every government office from the centre to the panchayat; to provide a wide variety of services to citizens. emerging technologies like social media will be used as a tool for; participative governance, directly engaging the people in policy making and administration., 23.my government is determined to rid the country of the scourge of corruption and the menace of black money. as a first step in this direction, the government has already constituted a sit to unearth black money stashed abroad. this will be followed up vigorously by proactively engaging with foreign governments., 24.keeping in mind that justice delayed is justice denied, my government will adopt a multi-pronged approach to address the problem of high pendency of cases in our judicial system. it will progressively modernize the courts to improve their operational efficiency, and start reform of the criminal justice system to make dispensation of justice simpler, quicker and more effective. it will initiate a mission mode project for filling vacancies in the judiciary and for doubling the number of courts and judges in the subordinate judiciary in a phased manner. the government will give special emphasis to the development of alternate dispute resolution mechanisms., honourable members, 25.on the economic front, we are passing through an extremely difficult phase. for two consecutive years, our gdp growth has been less than 5 per cent. tax collection has declined. inflation continues to be at an unacceptable level. thus, putting the indian economy back on track is paramount for my government. we will work together to usher our economy into a high growth path, rein in inflation, reignite the investment cycle, accelerate job creation and restore the confidence of the domestic as well as international community in our economy., 26.my government will create a policy environment which is predictable, transparent and fair. it will embark on rationalisation and simplification of the tax regime to make it non-adversarial and conducive to investment, enterprise and growth. my government will make every effort to introduce the gst while addressing the concerns of states. reforms will be undertaken to enhance the ease of doing business. my government will follow a policy of encouraging investments, including through fdi; which will be allowed in sectors that help create jobs and assets., 27.for rapid creation of jobs in the manufacturing sector, the government will strategically promote labour-intensive manufacturing. employment opportunities will also be expanded by promoting tourism and agro-based industries. my government will transform employment exchanges into career centres - connecting our youth with job opportunities in a transparent and effective manner through the use of technology as well as through counselling and training. the government will strengthen the pension and health insurance safety nets for labour force of all categories and would provide them access to modern financial services., 28.we need to transform ourselves into a globally competitive manufacturing hub powered by skill, scale and speed. to this end, the government will set up world class investment and industrial regions, particularly along the dedicated freight corridors and industrial corridors spanning the country. my government will encourage the domestic industry to innovate and collaborate internationally. it will strive to move towards a single-window system of clearances both at the centre and at the states through a hub-spoke model., 29.to strengthen our share in global trade, procedures will be simplified and trade infrastructure strengthened so as to reduce transaction time and costs. the ssi and handicraft sectors will be encouraged by providing them enhanced technological, marketing and investment support. export potential of this sector will be encouraged. my government will make every effort to improve the working conditions of our weavers in particular. it will also set up a task force to review and revive our msme sector., honourable members, 30.lack of robust infrastructure is one of india’s major impediments. the government will chalk out an ambitious infrastructure development programme to be implemented in the next 10 years. a fast-track, investment friendly and predictable ppp mechanism will be put in place. modernization and revamping of railways is on top of the infrastructure agenda. my government will launch a diamond quadrilateral project of high speed trains. the country will have a network of freight corridors with specialised agri-rail networks for perishable agricultural products. investment in railways will be increased using innovative financing methods. expansion of railways in hilly states and northeast region and modernization of rail safety systems will be prime focus areas. we will encourage r&d and high level local manufacturing for railway systems. a fast, time-bound and well monitored programme for execution of the national highways programme will be initiated, to overcome the stagnancy of the past few years. low cost airports will be developed to promote air connectivity to smaller towns. the government will evolve a model of port-led development. our long coastline will become the gateway for india’s prosperity. my government will facilitate modernization of existing ports on one hand, and development of new world class ports on the other. stringing together the sagar mala project we will connect the ports with the hinterland through road and rail. inland and coastal waterways will be developed as major transport routes., 31.my government will come out with a comprehensive national energy policy and focus on development of energy related infrastructure, human resource and technology. the aim of the government will be to substantially augment electricity generation capacity through judicious mix of conventional and non-conventional sources. it will expand the national solar mission and connect households and industries with gas-grids. reforms in the coal sector will be pursued with urgency for attracting private investment in a transparent manner. the international civil nuclear agreements will be operationalized and nuclear power projects for civilian purposes will be developed., 32.my government is conscious of the fact that our urban infrastructure is under severe stress. soon, 50 per cent of our population would be residing in urban areas. taking urbanization as an opportunity rather than a challenge, the government will build 100 cities focussed on specialized domains and equipped with world class amenities. integrated infrastructure will be rolled out in model towns to focus on cleanliness and sanitation. by the time the nation completes 75 years of its independence, every family will have a pucca house with water connection, toilet facilities, 24x7 electricity supply and access., honourable members, 33.while putting the country on a high growth path, my government will keep sustainability at the core of our planning process. my government strongly believes that environmental conservation can go hand in hand with development. to achieve this, environment and forest clearance systems will be made more predictable, transparent and time-bound. simultaneously, an effective system will be developed for sound appraisal processes and strict compliance of clearance conditions, especially those relating to rehabilitation of displaced communities and regeneration of forests. cleaner fuels will be promoted to bring down pollution levels in our cities. the government will earnestly take up mitigation works to meet the challenges posed by climate change and will closely work with the global community in this regard. conservation of himalayan ecology will be a priority area for my government. a national mission on himalayas will be launched., 34. in the recent past, serious concerns have been expressed regarding use of discretionary powers in allocation of our precious natural resources. the government will formulate clear and transparent policies on allocation of critical natural resources such as coal, minerals and spectrum., 35.river ganga is a part of our rich cultural heritage, a symbol of faith and the lifeline for millions. however, ganga continues to remain polluted with many stretches of the river becoming dry in lean season. my government will take all necessary steps to ensure a perennial, clean and pristine ganga., 36.our rich cultural heritage is the very foundation on which rests the unity of our diverse nation. indian languages are repositories of our rich literature, history, culture, art and other achievements. my government will launch a national mission “e-bhasha” that will develop digital vernacular content and disseminate our classic literature in different languages. my government will also provide the required resources for the maintenance and restoration of national heritage sites., 37.india has a vast untapped potential for tourism which can play a special role in our socio-economic progress. the government will initiate a mission mode project to create 50 tourist circuits that are built around specific themes. with a view to encouraging pilgrimage tourism, a national mission for beautifying and improving the amenities and infrastructure at pilgrimage centres of all faiths will be launched., 38.my government recognises the central role of science and technology in raising the quality of life. it will encourage and incentivise private sector investments, both domestic and foreign, in science and technology and in high-end research aimed at nurturing innovation. my government will build world class research centres in the fields of nanotechnology, material sciences, thorium technology, brain research, stem cells, etc. the government will also establish institutes of technology for rural development and a central university of himalayan studies., honourable members, 39.the government will maintain utmost vigil in the area of internal security. a policy of zero tolerance towards terrorism, extremism, riots and crime will be pursued. the states will be assisted for modernizing police infrastructure and equipment to tackle new forms of terrorism including narco terrorism and cyber threats. a national plan will be chalked

2014-06-24,budget to focus on policies to promote growth: mayaram,"the budget will be centred on growth-promoting policies and finance minister arun jaitley will soon unveil new foreign direct investment (fdi) policies that the government is working on, finance secretary arvind mayaram said on tuesday., the government would focus on the infrastructure sector so that manufacturing that had slumped from 12 per cent growth to 0 per cent now could be revived, mr. mayaram further added. he explained that for this the system needed to gear up, especially for de-clogging the infrastructure sector as the new government had clearly stated that the system of project approvals was to be simplified and timelines were to be set so that there were no delays and so that then both domestic and foreign investments could return to the manufacturing sector., “i am confident that the economy will see a major change this year and it will take off this year,” the finance secretary said. he was speaking at the launch of the world investment report 2014 of the united nations conference on trade and development (unctad)., mr. jaitley will present the modi government’s first budget in parliament on july 10., the trend line gross domestic product (gdp) growth was what should be looked at and over the last 10 years it had been 6 per cent for india, the finance secretary said adding that he believed india’s potential was a growth rate of 8 per cent. the economy grew at a sub-5 per cent rate for the last two years., the slow economic growth had adversely impacted revenue collection, mr. jaitley said talking to reporters on the sidelines of a navy function on tuesday. “with regard to the finance ministry...this is a challenging time for it …because in the last two years, the economy has moved at a slow pace...whatever steps have to be taken in this direction, this is the time for it and you will have to wait for this,” the finance minister said., the finance minister also said that over the last three-four weeks he had been holding consultations with stakeholders to make the economy grow at a faster pace, reinstate the trust of investors in it and to make plans for bringing it back on track by holding consultations with stakeholders., pti reports:, with growth trending below 5 per cent for two successive years, mr. mayaram said india would prefer the fdi route over fii inflows if overseas resources need to be generated to spur economic expansion to its potential level., “i believe our potential growth rate is 8 per cent. and to get there, we need to develop resources. and that which we cannot generate domestically must come from outside and if it comes from outside then we prefer it in the form of foreign direct investment (fdi) rather than foreign institutional investment (fii),” mr. mayaram said., india’s gdp expanded 4.5 per cent in 2012-13, the slowest pace in the past decade, and at 4.7 per cent in 2013-14. the rbi this month retained its gdp growth estimate of 5-6 per cent in 2014-15. foreign investment is considered crucial for india, which needs an estimated $1 trillion in the five-year period ending march 2017 to overhaul infrastructure such as ports, airports and highways to boost growth. a decline in foreign investment could affect the country’s balance of payments and the rupee., overall foreign inflows into the country grew 8 per cent to $24.29 billion in the previous financial year from $22.42 billion in 2012-13. to further attract foreign inflows, the government plans to relax the fdi policy in

2014-07-06,‘modi is very focussed on what india needs’,"singapore foreign minister k. shanmugam, who met prime minister narendra modi earlier this week, tells the hindu in an interview in chennai that mr. modi was “focussed” in outlining the areas in which india needs assistance, and spoke about his vision for smart cities, upgrading skills and the development of industrial corridors. excerpts:, you have been in the country since monday and you have met a lot of important people. i would like to begin by asking what your discussion with prime minister narendra modi were about?, the prime minister is very focussed, on his viewpoints on what india needs and in what ways people can work with india. and the primary focus was economic, the upliftment of the people of india. he talked about his vision, the needs, the smart cities project that he is thinking of, the skills upgrading that is necessary, the other areas in which he wants to focus on, including the industrial corridors and the topics along these lines., so with regard to these smart cities did you discuss any specifics about which cities, or are these going to be the new cities?, we didn’t get to that level of cities at this discussion. i have no competence to start discussing that sort of thing because ultimately these investments are made by the private sector. the role of the government — of the two governments is to try and create that structure, that bridge, the framework that will make it attractive for the private sector on both sides to combine together and build something for the benefit of the people. and it must make sense for them as corporations., so what was important at that meeting was the clear identification by the prime minister of his priorities and my own point to him that singapore is a trusted and valued partner of india wants to see india succeeds, and we need to give shape to these big ideas. and how do we give shape? we have suggested that the way to do it is for a platform to be setup with some ministers on both sides and senior officials who should be thrashing out — first we need to identify which of these areas because india will have many people who want to invest each of them will have their own areas of expertise. so which areas can singapore participate in, where india may need singapore to want to come in, or india may want singapore to come in and what type of discretion, and what type of legal and fiscal frame work. all that needs to be thrashed out so we suggested that we do that but to give ourselves some time line so that by the time the two prime ministers meet some time later this year there will be some concrete outline of what can be achieved., so you spoke about a platform. what kind of platform is this?, we have platforms with countries were ministers meet together in a formal setting with a clear mandate for what they have to do. so the prime minister identifies a couple of ministers, on our side we identify a couple of ministers, and then we identify the relevant agencies which would have the mandate, or whose remit it is to deal with the areas that the prime ministers outlined and which way i also discussed. we discussed skills upgrading, we discussed hospitality, we discussed the smart cities project, urban solutions., so you know there are specific agencies with the remit to deal with regulatory issues, and to push it through. so they will need to come through and sit together with our people, identify which of them are doable on the indian side. we have to identify which of them are doable on the singapore side, and then we narrow down, you identify specific projects and we need to talk to the private sectors. so there ar lot of works to be done., so each of these will be a separate platform or it will be together?, no, it will all be together. and you know, it doesn’t mean that every one of them will go through. that’s what i meant by one has got to work out — what is doable by us, may not be doable by others., great! and the visit is going to be later this year in november?, not a visit to direct/bilateral visit but there are a number of places where the two prime ministers could meet at multilateral and the idea is that this gives a time frame for the ideas to be crystallised., what is the time frame you are looking about?, we are talking about five/six months at least to get an outline., so just moving on, you met also chief minister jayalalithaa today do be able to give the specific or draft discussion., it was pretty much along the same lines. the chief minister pointed out that singapore investments in tamil nadu were significant, but she also pointed out the given this close and strong social and cultural linkages between the two places singapore and tamil nadu, the economic relationship has a lot more potential. i agreed with that i said there is a huge amount of international capital which is in singapore looking for deployment, and international capital will go to the best places which offer the best returns. and she identified specific areas which are part of her vision: desalination so as to provide clean drinking water for the people, industrial corridors; she talked about finance, and infrastructure. so as i said look — again at the ministerial level it is difficult for me to sit down and either discuss or commit and equally it is not easy for her to discuss or commit when these are big things. she knows the areas were her priorities are. i know roughly where we can add some value., but the next step, and she had senior ministers and secretaries, particularly in the industrial and financial sector there, and i said look the next step is for officials to follow up and discuss and she agreed and so that will happen. in addition i suggested that there is a social project, there is a not for profit organisation called singapore international foundation which does good social work in many parts of the world, and they have done some work on health care in tamil nadu and they would like to do a bit more. i offered that they can touch base with their officials and we can try and do some thing., they already do something?, they have done something. the idea is to also build the sought of what you might call as moral linkages. we have some capacity in these fields and we want to try and do some good around the world. and so this is an area that chief minister was very enthusiastic about it because it dovetails with her own priorities and primary health care. of course one is got to understand we are a small place tamil nadu itself is a much bigger place than singapore, so the scale in which we can do these things will be limited but it can form a useful template for others to pick up and take it further., i was going to come to the size mismatch between singapore and india..., well that has not prevented us from being the largest investor in india and china last year., that’s right, i was going to come exactly to that. we have a double taxation treaty and limitations benefits clause. we have seen that singapore is now the largest source of fdi into india i think 25 per cent and its kind of toppled mauritius…, i don’t know mauritius may still be higher but mauritius is sui generis, its unique. i mean its money that comes in because of the special position mauritius has in terms of tax vis-à-vis india., without relating these two, i am asking if we can be sure that everything that comes into india from singapore is not out of front office company?, well madam, i don’t run the private sector. i provide the legal frame work. i can be sure and guaranteeing that it is all in conformity with the laws, and you know the investments come in here. the indian authorities are aware of that . beyond that who the investors are how they raise the capital is really not something i can talk about. but if you look at the type of investments -- just take the ascendas investments: ascendas is a highly reputable company, listed us $ 700 million in combination/partnership with two japanese companies — one is a bank and the other is jgc, and it will create 200 thousand jobs when fully completed. those are the kinds of investments that you could see in., there is the industrial park, there are investment in warehousing, in the financial sector. ascott, which is a big brand name in singapore has started serviced apartments. so you have a variety and this is what we know as big ticket items. small and medium industries are investing huge amounts but that is not something that we can keep track of., in recent years we have also seen singapore and india developing very strong defence cooperation, it is over a decade old this defence agreement between the two countries. how much does it have to do with singapore’s own balancing of regional powers, perhaps vis-à-vis china., we have an excellent relationship with china. as i said we are the largest investor in china last year, and we have several government to government projects for obvious historical and cultural reasons. 74 per cent of our population are chinese. they trace their roots back to china. there is a lot of people to people connectivity and our relationship with china is very good and we don’t see that as being held hostage to any other relationship., likewise we have an excellent relationship with the u.s. japan, india and that’s always been part of our foreign policy. and if we train here and we have a close defence relationship with india, that’s because india provides us with space for training, which is important for us, and we value indian assistance there. and we cooperate with those countries in defence where we think they were able to cooperate with us — india and others. these are our good close trusted partners. but we don’t even thinking in terms of balancing india and china. that’s too big again. it’s not the game we can play., so what are singapore’s national security concerns if i may ask. if there is a defence cooperation, if there is all this training, do you perceive security threats?, we believe that as a small country whose very existence was laughed off at our independence, 720 sq. km with no natural resources, and don’t forget when we became independent, we were in a low intensity complex with our giant neighbour indonesia, so we were born at a time when there was war so war is a part of the psyche. small countries, history shows you, don’t last for a very long so we said to ourselves we have the ability to defend ourselves. it doesn’t mean that you will necessarily be under attack, but the best way to prevent any trouble is to make it clear that you were able to defend yourself. so when we have defence cooperation agreement with india it allows us to train in india, it gives us a space to train. that is vital for us, for own national security. it is not a question of expecting india or any other country to come in to help us., do you see this whole spat between china and japan as something that is threatening the region’s stability?, basically, as a small country we want peace and stability. that’s how asia is progressed in the last 50 years. for that to happen, you need the relationship between washington and beijing to be on good footing. they have to sort it out and work out something. they are going to be competitors and they are going to be cooperative in some fields. they need to sort it out in such a way that it doesn’t lead to tension. that’s one. the second most important relationship is between beijing and tokyo. that is undergoing some stress right now, some stress because there are disputes which had long been put aside which have now taken center-stage. and there is some considerable trust deficit between china and japan. so, all of this has increased tension. we can only sit back and say that this is not good for the region. and it’s not in china’s interest and it’s not in japan’s interest., so as a leading member of asean is there something that asean itself can do..., asean has built a series of multilateral platforms including the asean regional forum, and asean defence ministers meeting, which involves a number of partners, and the east asia summit which brings together leaders at the summit level. all of these provide the scope for regional issues to be openly discussed so it’s at least something where people have to talk about the issues and the rest of us try and see the tensions are kept to the minimum possible. but you know there is no one solutions that can completely take care of all issues between big countries. it requires will power and a lot of political will on the part of each of the countries., i just wanted to move on to singapore’s strong defence production industry its own, and in your discussions in delhi with the prime minister and the foreign minister, and mr. jaitely as well, did you push for whole issue of fdi..., no, i didn’t raise the topic., but you would obviously be looking forward to that?, i know this really depends on what how india proceeds. when we go to a country we play by the rules of that country, and so this is something that india will have to decide. if and when in the rules here change in that, i am sure companies will look at it. but i didn’t raise it. it was not an area of specific discussions on monday or tuesday., india has its look east policy. the upa government had pushed it, but for some reason it has not been able to live up to its potential. it has always remained a slogan. from your side what do you see as road blocks to that? what is stopped this potential from being fully achieved?, i think a big country like india would have and does have a whole lot of domestic issues to deal with and any government will prioritise that. then if you move beyond the domestic issues again a big country has number of international interests. its relationship with washington is important its relationship with europe is important, relationship with beijing is important and at the same time there are relationships with pakistan, afghanistan and there are a set of issues relating to the north west. so which of these are not important? given that the neighbourhood has been busy given that domestically there is a growing population with growing aspirations and economy that is huge and which needs to be managed, i think one has got to look at india’s policies with that frame of mind. so it has had a look east policy with good intentions, and india did take part in some initiatives. i think people will say the potential for doing is much more is that. but when we assess that we else also have to accept that india has a large number of priorities., the other thing that i wanted to ask you about is recently, in december last year, there were riots in singapore in little india. a number of indian workers were arrested and some are being sentenced and i am just wondering what are lessons for all sides to draw from that episode?, no. it’s a law and order situation and the committee of inquiry has issued its report. it started out with the unfortunate death of one individual who was intoxicated, tried to get on to a bus. in singapore the rules are if the bus is full you cannot stay in the bus so he was told to get down. he was upset and he dropped his pants in the bus, and then finally he got off but the poor chap ran alongside the bus which he shouldn’t have, and when the bus made a turn he got caught into another wheels., as the coi, which had extensive hearings concluded, he was primarily responsible for that. others who were at the scene were upset at his death, and also some misconceptions about how he died and they were themselves also intoxicated so it was fuelled in a large measure by alcohol. so we have to look at it this context and the point i made to various indian interlocutors — no one has raised it with me at the official level, only journalists. they have asked me after they understood the facts, why we were making such a big deal, something like this happens in every indian city once a month in slightly bigger scale, so why is singapore making such a big deal of it. so let us look at it in this context. for us we took it seriously. we had a coi because something like this hadn’t happened in 44 years., but you saw what the coi has said. alcohol was the main reason. they took it upon themselves to destroy public property and they were dealt with in accordance with the law; some were repatriated immediately, some have been charged and caught due process, they pleaded guilty and some have served their jail sentence some are waiting for trial. if a singaporean or foreign national commits a crime in india you will deal with him accordance of laws of india., likewise we deal with them in accordance with the laws of singapore. in terms of foreign workers are, workers from india, let’s get a few things clear. first they are there by free choice. no one is asking them to come to singapore. first of all they could stay in india. if the conditions were superior to what is available in singapore they will stay here. so after taking into account pay, living conditions and working conditions they have chosen to come to singapore over staying here. second, as between singapore and other countries they could choose to go to the middle east, they could choose to go to malaysia, choose to go to other countries. they have chosen singapore. in fact when i visited the workers’ dormitories to speak with them because i speak tamil, uniformly they told me singapore is number one on their list because it is a place of workers’ rights are protected, there is a framework of rule of law, there is a certain freedom and they are treated better than many other places.",0.13868227202904626,‘modi focussed india needs ’,"singapore foreign minister k. shanmugam , met prime minister narendra modi earlier week , tells hindu

2014-07-10,a blueprint for the defence industry,"as the new government prepares to present its first general budget, there is expectation that foreign direct investment (fdi) in the defence sector will be liberalised, but by itself, this is unlikely to contribute much towards the goals of self-sufficiency and self-reliance., there are reports that the department of industrial policy and promotion (dipp) is pushing to allow 49 per cent fdi without transfer of technology, 74 per cent with transfer of technology, and even 100 per cent in cases involving the transfer of state-of-the-art technology and equipment, while the defence ministry would like it to be restricted to 49 per cent. this debate is sterile because merely liberalising fdi will not help. what is needed is an appreciation of the characteristics of the defence industry and coordination among the multiple stakeholders who drive, and have often distorted the decision-making process., distant goals, continuing imports the twin objectives of self-sufficiency and self-reliance have been articulated, sometimes interchangeably and at times separately, since the early 1950s. in 1947, india inherited the ordnance factories (of) organisation, which today consists of 41 ofs, nine defence public sector undertakings (dpsu) and 50 or so defence r&d laboratories under the defence research and development organisation (drdo). the model followed was “production of technologies conceptualised by the drdo; projects nominated by mod ministry of defence after consulting the services; and assembly and production of platforms under licence from foreign oems (original equipment manufacturers).” currently, with about two lakh employees, the ofs and dpsus have a modest turnover of $7.6 billion. the goals of self-reliance and self-sufficiency remain distant, with almost 70 per cent of defence equipment still being imported., a task force set up in 1998 concluded that the public sector alone could not deliver; licensed production had fostered neither indigenisation nor innovation; and frequent blame games between the services, the drdo and the dpsus were leading to delays in acquisition. a self-reliance review committee set up in 1992, under dr. abdul kalam’s chairmanship developed a self-reliance index (sri), defined as the percentage share of indigenous content in total procurement expenditure, and set a target of 70 per cent self-reliance by 2005, now pushed to 2020., merely liberalising fdi will not help. what is needed is an appreciation of the characteristics of the defence industry and coordination among the multiple stakeholders who drive, and have often distorted the decision-making process , the first instance of opening up of the defence sector came in 2001, with the domestic private sector being allowed to produce defence items with fdi up to 26 per cent, subject to industrial licensing and security clearances. this was followed by the announcement of a defence procurement procedure in 2002, a defence offsets policy in 2006, a long term integrated perspective plan (ltipp) in 2009, a defence production policy in 2011, and eight committees/task forces set up to look into various aspects of national defence, including defence production and self-reliance, since 2000. clearly, the issue remained a priority for various governments, but the outcome has been meagre. certainly, some responsibility rests with former defence minister a.k. antony’s tendency to avoid decision-making if it could be postponed, but there are underlying structural reasons too. consequently, forward movement during the last decade has lacked purpose., growing defence expenditure since 2001, the total fdi received in the defence sector is below $5 million. meanwhile, india’s defence expenditure has been growing every year; today, india has the eighth largest defence budget in the world, accounting for 3 per cent of global defence expenditures and, in recent years, has also emerged as the largest defence importer, with nearly 10 per cent of global defence imports. with growing obsolescence and a 10 per cent annual rise in the capital budget for equipment procurement, a conservative estimate indicates that india will spend nearly $100 billion over the next eight years to modernise and equip its armed forces. during the 12th five year plan, the defence capital account budget is expected to go up from $15.9 billion to $25.6 billion. by the end of the 14th five year plan, the cumulative capital expenditures over 2012–27 are projected to exceed $235 billion. assuming that 80 per cent is meant for platform acquisitions, of which 60-70 per cent is earmarked for committed liabilities, this still leaves 30-40 per cent for new schemes. to meet the target of 70 per cent self-reliance by 2020 requires an indigenous defence industry worth $80-$100 billion, with a direct employment potential of 1.25 lakh skilled workers and indirect support to a workforce of another five lakh., in addition are investments via the defence offsets policy. this policy, announced in 2005, requires the foreign company to invest 30 per cent of the indicative cost in the request for proposals when the indicative cost is rs.300 crore or more. initially, the offsets were for the defence sector, but in 2009, the policy was diluted to permit offsets to civil aviation and internal and coastal security sectors too. its objectives are to improve the domestic defence r&d base; develop an internationally competitive defence industry, and an industrial base covering dual use technologies (i.e. having both civilian and defence applications). offsets are implemented by raising domestic procurement, generating exports, bringing fdi into related services and building local supply chains, transferring technology/equipment to indian entities, etc. the drdo has identified a list of 15 critical technologies that it seeks to acquire through offsets; incidentally, exports of most of these technologies are controlled and require special approvals by the foreign vendor’s government. till 2012, 16 offset contracts, worth $4.3 billion, were signed and this is expected to cross $25 billion by 2020.",0.028296944601292427,blueprint defence industry,"new government prepares present first general budget , expectation foreign direct investment ( fdi ) defence sector liberalised , , unlikely contribute much towards goals self-sufficiency self-reliance. , reports department industrial policy promotion ( dipp ) pushing allow 49 per cent fdi without transfer technology , 74 per cent transfer technology , even 100 per cent cases involving transfer state-of-the-art technology equipment , defence ministry would like restricted 49 per cent. debate sterile merely liberalising fdi help. needed appreciation characteristics defence industry coordination among multiple stakeholders drive , often distorted decision-making process. , distant goals , continuing imports twin objectives self-sufficiency self-reliance articulated , sometimes interchangeably times separately , since early 1950s. 1947 , india inherited ordnance factories ( ) organisation , today consists 41 ofs , nine defence public sector undertakings ( dpsu ) 50 defence r&d laboratories defence research development organisation ( drdo ) . model followed “production technologies conceptualised drdo ;

2014-07-11,more continuity than change,"over the years, the indian budget has ceased to be a mere statement of accounts and has also laid down the broad contours of economic policies to be followed. the nda government assumed office less than two months before the >presentation of the budget with a promise to overhaul the economy. no doubt, the expectations from the finance minister have been unrealistically high. not just the stock markets but practically everyone had been expecting him to deliver on the election promises of a paradigm shift to boost the economy. arun jaitley has done well to emphasise that the measures announced in the budget are only “the beginning of a journey towards a sustained growth of 7-8 per cent or above within the next 3-4 years along with macroeconomic stabilisation that includes lower levels of inflation, lesser fiscal deficit and a manageable current account deficit.” those words, along with some robust but realistic budget targets and a wide range of allocations to diverse sectors, helped stabilise the markets and earned the finance minister appreciation for his maiden effort. among the noteworthy measures are the move towards a friendlier and more stable tax regime, encouragement to fdi in critical sectors, the focus on infrastructure including power and roads, and the emphasis on removing obstacles to mining., the challenge before the nda government was to persist with fiscal consolidation while simultaneously creating more space for desperately needed public investment. the upa government’s interim budget had set an overly ambitious >fiscal deficit target of 4.1 per cent for the current year. while acknowledging that it would be a daunting task in the backdrop of two years of low gdp growth and the subsidy burden among other factors, the government has retained the target. the fiscal deficit targets for the immediate future are even more challenging, at 3.6 per cent and 3 per cent for 2015-16 and 2016-17 respectively. the revenue deficit is slated to come down to below 3 per cent. fiscal consolidation over the recent past has been achieved by reduction in expenditure rather than by revenue accretion. even though the economy is yet to come out of the sub-5 per cent growth trajectory, the budget has targeted an ambitious 17 per cent growth in net tax revenues — from the revised estimate of rs.8,36,026 crore in 2013-14 to rs.9,77,258 crore by the year-end. plan expenditure is budgeted at rs.5,75,000 crore, an increase of 26.9 per cent over 2013-14. non-plan expenditure with additional provision for fertilizer subsidy is slated to go up to over rs.12,19,892 crore, up from rs.12,07,900 crore in the interim budget. as expected, the budget is depending heavily on public sector disinvestment to narrow the deficit. the target of over rs.58,000 crore can be achieved only if the present high valuations in the stock markets continue for the remainder of this year. recent sebi rules mandating higher public shareholding for public sector undertakings will no doubt help the government. expenditure control will remain a priority area. an expenditure management commission to look into various aspects of expenditure reforms has been promised. its interim report, to be submitted within a year, will be keenly watched.",0.025497416020671838,continuity change,"years , indian

2014-07-11,tactics aligned to strategy,"there are four criteria by which to evaluate the >budget. first, as this is a new government, is the vision and how it is going to be implemented clear? the desire to meet the aspirations of the people through higher growth and faster decision-making has been articulated, but how the measures in the budget are expected to help these have not been clarified., second, have the economy’s ailments been diagnosed correctly and are the remedies appropriate? the prime contributions of past budgets to bottlenecks the economy faced were the large government transfers for consumption without releasing restrictions on the supply response. this budget does attempt, but only on the margin, to change the composition of government expenditure toward investment., the changes are marginal because there has not been much economising on revenue expenditure; there are some >tax concessions, and the fiscal deficit target has been maintained. but we should give the government some time before passing judgment. it may quickly act on the recommendations of the expenditure management commission that has been announced. the allocation for subsidies has actually increased, although restricted to two per cent of gdp. but they still appear to be underfunded, with no clarity on how they will be financed. the >optimistic growth projections of 19.7 per cent for tax revenue, made in the interim budget, have been retained. but they are better founded now because of a real possibility of higher domestic and international growth. more resources can also be raised from divestment because of a booming domestic stock market., promoting fdi there is a push toward infrastructure, education, health, water — key constraints and the alleviation of which would make life much easier for the average citizen. new technologies are to be leveraged wherever possible., many schemes have been announced, with small initial seed capital. the union finance minister arun jaitley seems to be using the inability of government spend effectively to ration initial allocations. it is a good strategy to conditional future allocations on demonstrated absorptive capacity and outcomes., apart from raising public investment, there are many measures to reverse the fall in private investment and increase its productivity. this is essential to reverse the slowdown in manufacturing. these include temporary tax credits for investment, with eligibility for an investment allowance extended to an investment of rs.25 crore, from the earlier limit of rs.100 crore. this will make many small and medium enterprises (sme) eligible and help kick-start investment., promoting >foreign direct investment (fdi) in strategic sectors such as defence production and insurance will also directly increase domestic jobs, technology and financing. fdi limits have been raised from 26 per cent to 49 per cent so that management and control remain with india. other concessions have been given with respect to land lock-in, especially for low cost housing., equity markets and households additional finance for investment comes from measures to encourage household savings. there is a 50 per cent rise in the public provident fund (ppf) limit eligible for tax exemption. an easier know-your-client (kyc) process and one single operating demat account will encourage financial savings. new instruments such as real estate investment trusts (reit), which will be given pass-through tax status, and public sector unit (psu) divestment, will bring households back into equity markets, allowing them to gain from india’s growth. banks will find it easier to fund long-term infrastructure with permission to raise long-term funds exempted from minimum statutory liquidity ratio (slr), cash reserve ratio (crr) requirements., last year, firefighting reduced the current account deficit (cad) and strengthened the rupee, but increasing domestic financial savings and deepening domestic markets are important among longer term measures to maintain a sustainable cad. while taking measures to deepen domestic financial markets, it is good that mr. jaitley has not further liberalised foreign debt flows. this should be done only after domestic supply constraints are removed. improving the >domestic business environment will also encourage exports., there is a push toward infrastructure, education, health, water — key constraints and the alleviation of which would make life much easier for the average citizen , although concrete action to reduce food inflation is limited, the budget has recognised the importance of coordination with states to modify the agricultural produce marketing committee (apmc) act, taking other steps to improve agricultural marketing, and restructuring the food corporation of india. allocations for the national rural employment guarantee act (nrega) are to be maintained but directed toward asset creation., a major shortcoming in the economy is high transaction costs and the possibility of unproductive arbitrage. there are a number of initiatives to reduce these, especially in the areas of tax structure and administration. there is a commitment to transparency, simplification, to listen to and rectify complaints. the government will not use retrospective amendments — it will set up a committee to review cases arising from past amendments; there are legal and administrative changes to reduce tax litigation; resident tax payers can also get an advance tax ruling; there are administrative provisions to ease access for them; a high-level committee will be set up to regularly interact with industry and respond to issues raised. taxation issues related to transfer pricing and the withholding tax have been clarified. dividend distribution tax is to be paid by the recipient, not the company; mutual fund earnings are subject to capital gains, not income tax, removing incentives for arbitrage in fund location., taxes the third assessment criterion, is the issue of who gains and who loses — the standard reason for budget hype. the salaried class which bears the largest tax burden has been given some concessions, even as selected industries have been given excise concessions. investment and savings tax credits should repay by raising more taxes as they stimulate more growth. subsidies and social sector spending have actually been raised, compared to the interim budget, so the lower income class does not lose;

2014-07-12,after budget 2014,"i heaved a sigh of relief after reading the >editorial (july 11) — which was impartial, unbiased and positive. almost all other editorials in the mainstream dailies targeted the government for not fulfilling promises made in the run-up to the election., menon g.,, mumbai, the opinions of a spectrum of political leaders, business leaders, social activists and experts helped us understand in a reader-friendly way what lies ahead. also, “cartoonscape” was right on target., b. jambulingam,, thanjavur, the maiden budget can at best be described as a directional one. under the circumstances, arun jaitley has had his task cut out — kick-start the economy; rein in inflation; reduce interest rates; project a business-friendly face and improve the tax-gdp ratio. it is important that india brings in foreign investors by converting foreign institutional investors into foreign direct investors by facilitating foreign capital induction and technology. it would be prudent to watch the implementation of the budget and see how the review deficit is managed. unless the government is able to rein in its expenditure and adequately raise revenue to bridge the gap, the bitter pill will have to be swallowed., v.r. shyam sundar,, chennai, the big push for 100 “smart cities” shows the government’s vision for the modernisation of india. a jarring note was the allocation of rs.200 crore for a sardar patel statue project, considering that there are sectors such as health, education and transport infrastructure that need aid. what is welcome is that there is no fresh tax burden on the common person., vineet sharma,, rewari, haryana, the announcement of the national mission on pilgrimage rejuvenation and spiritual augmentation drive (prasad) and the national heritage city development and augmentation yojana will help preserve our rich culture and heritage. the savings incentives for senior citizens is another good step. for a change, this budget appears to be honest and caring., r.d. singh,, ambala, haryana, the setting up of an expenditure management committee, 49 per cent fdi in the defence and insurance sectors, provisions for building highways and ports, river linkage, cleaning of the ganga, restructuring of the fci, promoting the ppp model and moderate personal tax exemption are some of the significant takeaways., s.n. srinivasan,, bangalore, i am not surprised that the poignancy and the harsh reality of the story, “two chaiwallahs and a budget” (july 10), does not find proper reflection in the budget. the present dispensation which equates bullet trains/branded food/airport-like railway stations to development; which looks at ppps and fdis (selected ones) as superior modes of governance, and which is particularly hostile to schemes like mgnrega because they were introduced by the upa/congress, cannot be expected to see virtue in such schemes. while they may not be abandoned, they will be let to flounder. but why blame the bjp, when upa-ii itself was indifferent to it. after this budget, the lives of the likes of chiman singh and their families continue to swing between hope and despair., m. balakrishnan,, bangalore, let’s talk about psu disinvestment. the accretion in the value of shares in these companies is not brought about by governmental investment alone; it is also because of the efforts of the employees. the government should earmark a portion of the proceeds following disinvestment to create a corpus that will take care of employees who have retired without any pension., k. rajendran,, chennai, rs. 60,000 crore for a bullet train in which 95 per cent of indians will never travel; rs.200 crore for a statue which is meant to mock the congress… it is apparent that there is quite a lot of money to be given away. therefore, mr. jaitley must stop complaining about “inheriting empty coffers.”, sham sankar,, thiruvananthapuram, all the election rhetoric of the bjp has come to naught. the only thing it did with some conviction was allowing fdi which it opposed tooth and nail when it was in the opposition. it is a shame that the bjp is so devoid of innovative ideas. whether “acche din” comes or not, “aam din” will continue for now. one only hopes that “bure din” doesn’t take over from there., h. mohamed john,, chennai, the increased cap on fdi in the insurance/defence sectors has been criticised by the left. but one should not forget that foreign investment constitutes barely 10 per cent of the total investment. the need of the hour is to strengthen domestic savings. the great depression of 1929 should always be kept in mind while formulating excessive pro-market economic policies., tabish naqvi,, patiala, mr. jaitley has inherited a bucking bronco of an economy. needless to say, the budget has come as a disappointment to many who were expecting mr. modi to wave a magic wand and say “imperio” to rein in the economy. this budget is not perfect. and neither were the earlier budgets. the minister has spelt out the various commitments of his government by introducing several rs.100-crore schemes. let’s hope this new recipe works out., nihar akunuri,, guntur, a finance minister can please all sections of society only when he has access to unlimited resources. the south says the north has been favoured while the poor say the rich or the corporate sector is being favoured. what more is there that a government in the developing world can do? if the congress president says the modi government has aped the policies of the congress government, she should take the budget to be a compliment., sridas sivasambo,, annamalai nagar, tamil nadu, not all curative amendments made this year have been accurate, leaving many questions unanswered. the government has given special attention to enhancing the growth of the non-conventional energy sector. with a significant increase in excise duty rates on tobacco products, aerated drinks with sugar and an increase in clean energy, it seems the government is keen on environment sustainability and the well-being of individuals., f.a. sulthanbi,, madurai, it is hard to understand why there is so much opposition to 49 per cent fdi in the defence sector. indigenisation has not helped and india still needs help from the west. foreign involvement is welcome., jaya kumar varma r.k.,, pandalam, kerala, the finance minister could have been even more considerate to senior citizens by offering them unlimited medical claim benefits., puthige ramesh,",0.11671939171939172,budget 2014,"heaved sigh relief reading >editorial ( july 11 ) — impartial , unbiased positive. almost editorials mainstream dailies targeted government fulfilling promises made run-up election. , menon g. ,, mumbai , opinions spectrum political leaders , business leaders , social activists experts helped us understand reader-friendly way lies ahead. also , “cartoonscape ” right target. , b. jambulingam ,, thanjavur , maiden budget best described directional one. circumstances , arun jaitley task cut — kick-start economy ;

2014-07-15,whose budget is it anyway?,"inadequate allocation: reduced plan expenditure directly hits funds for sectors which require a big increase in allocation, such as drinking water and sanitation. | photo credit: pti , modi sarkar’s first budget offered the prime minister the opportunity to spell out his government’s priorities and take steps towards delivering the promises he made during his election campaign. but it was clear from narendra modi’s ‘congress-free india’ slogan during the budget that he was interested only in the removal of individuals, not in a reversal of the economic policies followed by his predecessor., fiscal fundamentalism this >budget makes a mockery of the slogan sab ka saath sab ka vikas (with everyone, for everyone). finance minister arun jaitley said as much when he decried “populism”, which in the dictionary of the corporate world means any scheme which directs national resources towards fulfilling the needs of the poor. the budget presented by mr. jaitley is a continuation from where former finance minister p. chidambaram left off, both in its fundamental policy thrust and in its skewed priority in allocations., mr. chidambaram had also adopted the deceitful practice of not spending even the inadequate allocations he made. the gap between allocation and actual expenditure became an instrument to control deficit, while permitting the announcement of grandiose schemes. to illustrate, a sum of rs.1,000 crore had been allocated for the nirbhaya fund, but there was zero expenditure. mr. jaitley has conveniently used the lower revised estimates to conceal his own woefully inadequate allocations. it is to be seen whether even this lowered amount allocated is actually spent at the end of this fiscal., this feature of fiscal fundamentalism adopted by the united progressive alliance government remains the cornerstone of national democratic alliance’s policy. translated into the everyday experience of people, this basically means that the government will not expand its expenditure to meet their needs because it claims it cannot spend more than its revenue. however, it does not want to take the logical step of increasing its revenue by raising the tax rates for the rich, therefore trapping the country in its circular argument., the total plan expenditure in this budget is rs.5.75 lakh crore compared to the budget estimate of 2013-14 of rs.5.55 lakh crore. factoring in an inflation rate of seven per cent, this constitutes a cut of four per cent in real terms., there are two aspects to the impact of reduced plan expenditure. the first is that it directly hits funds for rural housing, provision of drinking water and sanitation — sectors which require a big increase in allocation. it is unbelievable but true that the rs.15,266.85 crore allocation made by mr. jaitley for provision of drinking water and sanitation has increased only marginally since the 2013-2014 budget. obviously drinking water and sanitation are less of a priority than the statue of sardar patel for which the finance minister has generously allotted rs.200 crore., equally disturbing is the denial of any increased >expenditure for the mgnrega programme. the budget has reduced the funds available in real terms. with a drought being predicted, a huge expansion of the programme to provide drought relief to the 60 per cent agriculture-dependent working population of our country was essential. but the rs.33,000 crore allocation made by mr. chidambaram — which itself was a reduced allocation — has been essentially repeated by this budget. this means that instead of creating jobs, we are destroying them., the government is also the largest employer of women. today more than rs.50 lakh scheme workers, mainly women, fulfil responsibilities equal to those of government employees, but for a pittance. shamefully, the budget does not have anything for them. how can you have a slogan of beti bachao, beti padhao (save your daughter, educate your daughter) when the basic unit responsible for looking after the girl child in the under-five age group, the anganwadi centre, is being starved of funds?, the finance minister received loud applause when he stated his aim to fulfil the prime minister’s dream of developing infrastructure, especially road connectivity throughout the country. he announced rs.37,880 crore for the national highway authority of india and state roads, including rs.3,000 crore for the northeast. a closer look at the figures reveals that far from an improvement, these represent a cut in allocations from earlier., the second aspect is that fiscal policies, obsessed with maintaining an arbitrarily decided lakshman rekha for deficit, in this case the chidambaram-determined 4.1 per cent, will deprive the economy to be kick-started through massive public investment for employment-led growth. the approach to resource mobilisation is to open up every sector — from defence to highways to real estate — to foreign investors and domestic corporates. the plan to push fdi in insurance to 49 per cent from the present 26 per cent will actualise the indo-u.s. forum demand, which was resisted by vast sections of the working people., the >pro-business bias has to be seen in conjunction with the stated moves to dilute the already weak land acquisition act to make takeover of land easier for industry. the emphasis on expanding industrial corridors, many of which will go through tribal and fifth schedule areas to benefit mining companies, will lead to large-scale displacement and elimination of tribal rights. these are the hidden costs of the budget., no change in direction, the other big promise was to control prices but the budget will actually increase them. the cuts in fuel subsidies by about rs.22,000 crore means that the prices of petrol and diesel will increase, leading to a cascading impact on other essential commodities. at the same time, the allocations for the food subsidy are not adequate to cover implementation of the new food security law., >there was an alternative but that would have meant a radical change in direction. that path lay in raising taxes of the corporates and the rich. but mr. modi has not raised tax on their profits at all. the revenue from direct taxes is slated to decrease by rs.22,000 crore. this at a time when india has one of the lowest tax-gdp ratios of 10.6 per cent among the g20 countries.",0.05074690567648316,whose budget anyway ?,"inadequate allocation : reduced plan expenditure directly hits

2014-07-19,"milestones set, but road map not clear","the union budget is more than a statement of accounts. it is a policy statement. that is why the first budget of the new government was looked forward to with great expectations. in many ways, these expectations have been fulfilled. but some fundamental issues remain unresolved., a budget can be analysed from three standpoints. the first is its impact on the economy which is mainly through the fiscal deficit. this will indicate how expansionary the >fiscal policy is. the second relates to the expenditure pattern. this gives us an idea of the expenditure priorities of the government. the third is the tax design which affects the tax payers’ ability and willingness to save and invest., fiscal deficitthe main message from the budget is the commitment to fiscal consolidation. the finance minister has decided to stick with a fiscal deficit of >4.1 per cent of gdp as indicated in the interim budget. there is also a commitment to take it down to 3.6 per cent next in the fiscal and to 3 per cent the year after. this is sought to be achieved by raising the tax/gdp ratio from 10.2 per cent in 2013-14, to 10.6, 10.9 and 11.2 per cent in the subsequent three years., it is important to recognise the critical role played by the fiscal deficit. a sustained level of high fiscal deficit leads to growing debt and interest payments grow larger. as of 2013-14, interest payments constituted 45.5 per cent of the net tax-revenue of the centre. also, a high level of borrowing by the government reduces the space available for the private sector. the savings in financial assets of the household sector, which is the only surplus sector in the economy, are now around 10 per cent of gdp. a combined fiscal deficit of the centre and states at 6 per cent of gdp seems, in this context, to be reasonable. without any restriction on the fiscal deficit, budget making is the easiest exercise., the budget for 2014-15 is postulated on the assumption that >tax revenue will grow at 19.8 per cent. real gdp is expected to grow between 5.4 per cent and 5.9 per cent. therefore, nominal income may grow around 13 per cent. this by itself implies a high level of inflation. with this rise in nominal income, the expected tax buoyancy is around 1.4. achieving the presumed tax revenue appears to be a hard task., there was some apprehension about the tax revenue projected in the interim budget, which persists. in fact, with the tax concessions announced in the current budget, there is a reduction in the tax revenue of rs.9,000 crore. expenditures contemplated show an increase of rs.31,000 crore. thus, the shortfall increases by rs.40,000 crore. this has been offset by a substantial increase in non tax revenue. disinvestment is now pegged at rs.63,000 crore. dividend contribution from the reserve bank of india (rbi) goes up by rs. 13,000 crore. it must be noted that any outflow from the rbi has an expansionary effect. taking all these factors into account, it appears that achieving the fiscal deficit of 4.1 per cent is going to be difficult. if the government is serious about adhering to the fiscal deficit target, it must be willing to cut expenditures as revenues fall short of budgeted levels. pruning of expenditures must be done in such a way that this has the least adverse impact on the economy. new projects must be held over and available resources utilised to complete existing projects. in short, an alternative expenditure programme must be ready on hand., expenditure patternsthe expenditure announcements include many new projects. each project, taken by itself, is important and valuable. but some caution is needed. the government’s investment expenditure should not be spread out thin over >several projects. under the present circumstances, public sector investment can be a catalyst for private investment. therefore, utilising funds available to complete existing projects must take priority. it is good that an allocation of rs.37,880 crore has been made for >road development. the initiative to set up a venture capital fund for start-ups is also extremely welcome. there are indeed several measures aimed at stimulating private investment such as those relating to >foreign direct investment (fdi). one of the suggestions has been to allow banks to float long-term bonds which may be utilised for long-term lending for capital expenditures. my own preference would be to revive the earlier system of development finance institutions. at that time, we had a network of development finance institutions at the state level and one or two at the national level. we moved over to the universal banking system from this model. this worked reasonably well but the banking system is reaching the limits in terms of group and sector exposures. our hope that the capital market will develop and equity and debt funds will be available for long-term capital expenditure has not materialised. it is in this context that a relook at the earlier system may be in order., most of the tax proposals made in the budget are welcome. they reflect good homework. several of them are in the nature of clarifying and introducing transparency, as in the case of transfer pricing. a low withholding tax on all bonds issued by indian corporates abroad is welcome. lowering the limit for investment allowance is very much justified under the present circumstances. the incentives for the promotion of savings are well calibrated.",0.15559812409812412,"milestones set , road map

2014-08-02,a new template for india-nepal ties,"the nepalese leadership have begrudged the spurning of their repeated invitations to visit kathmandu by india’s previous prime ministers for over a decade-and-a-half. prime minister >narendra modi’s visit, and the joint commission meeting — held after almost a quarter century — signals to them the beginning of a two-way political re-engagement between the two countries., indians and nepalese share a common culture and terrain south of the himalaya. bound by languages and religions, marriage and mythology, the links of their civilisational contacts run through lumbini to bodh gaya, pashupatinath to kashi vishwanath, and muktinath to tirupati. at the people-to-people level, relations between india and nepal are closer and more multifaceted than between india and any other country. many partisans of nepalese democracy also fought for india’s freedom, for which they were jailed by the british, including matrika koirala, b.p. koirala, and man mohan adhikari, who became prime ministers of nepal., political evolutionmany indians believe independent india never had foreign combat troops deployed on its soil. nepalese troops were the exception. aside from those recruited to india’s gurkha regiment, an outsized nepalese army brigade drawn from all its 18 regiments was loaned to india in 1948-49, when indian troops were deployed in kashmir and for the integration of indian states. the commanding officer of this force, general sharda shamsher jang bahadur rana, was the son of the then prime minister of nepal, maharaja mohan shamsher jang bahadur rana. yuvraj karan singh’s marriage to yasho rajya lakshmi, sharda shamsher’s daughter, was arranged during the general’s stay in india., the open border is a ‘safety-valve’ for nepal. without compromising india’s security, the challenge is to turn it into a bridge, not a barrier , cultural affinities and familial ties provide the comfort of familiarity, perhaps also an instinct for fraternity. but closeness begets complexities too, and dependence — for essential supplies, trade, transit, investments, and employment — does not engender goodwill, especially when relations are not handled with sensitivity and care., india’s bilateral interaction with nepal was in a holding pattern since 2001, when king birendra and crown prince dipendra died in the narayanhiti palace shoot-out. at the time, nepal was facing the maoist insurgency. this ended with the signing of the 12-point agreement in new delhi in november 2005. meanwhile, the constitutional coup by king gyanendra triggered public protests and brought the democratic forces together with the maoists. he restored the previous parliament the following year, but it was too late to save the monarchy. a constituent assembly (ca), elected in 2008, failed to promulgate a new constitution. this has still not taken definite shape, though a new ca has been in place since november 2013., during this period, india reinforced the consensus-building process in nepal by engaging nepal’s political leaders and assisting its institutional stakeholders. india supported the jana andolans of 1990 and 2006, both of which were led by the people of nepal. constitution writing is stuck on deeply divisive issues: the form of government, the geographies of the federal units, and the extent of devolution of authority to them. these are issues best addressed by the nepalese themselves., >read: a new beginning with nepal, in its political journey, nepal has traversed more difficult obstacles before. it has completed the transition from a monarchy to a republic, and from civil war to a democratic order. it has mainstreamed the maoists, except its extremist fringe, and integrated former maoist combatants into the nepalese army — a template worthy of emulation in other post-conflict peace building situations. there is an agreement across the broad political spectrum, excluding the extreme right and left, that nepal will be a federal democratic republic, and that the new constitution will reflect the progressive changes in nepal’s polity., the inclusive nature of nepalese society gives reasons for hope that the unfinished tasks of the peace process will be completed. in spite of per capita income levels declining towards close to half of india’s average, nepal has done better than india on several millennium development goals (mdg), including infant mortality, maternal health, child malnutrition and poverty reduction rates., if a new constitution does not emerge, nepal will be pregnant with possibilities hard to predict, not excluding the launch of another insurgency., having developed the confidence over the past decade to be able to work with any democratic electoral outcome in nepal, india has kept the day-to-day bilateral institutional mechanisms in play. these include defence cooperation and supplies, trade access and transit facilitation, river protection works, augmentation of electricity supply during the lean season, exim bank credit for the infrastructure sector, and development projects, including construction of terai roads, integrated check points at important border crossings and cross-border rail links. many of these need a strong push from the two governments to speed their implementation. there exists excellent two-way cooperation between the respective security agencies to deal with difficult cross-border issues such as terrorism, smuggling (including of fake indian currency notes), and trafficking., people-centric issuesindia has been ready to receive nepalese proposals to revise the antiquated 1950 treaty of peace and friendship — unequal principally because of the one-way privileges it accords to nepalese nationals living and working in india. other tasks include resumption of the boundary working group, signing of the finalised strip maps, and signature or ratification of a host of treaties and letters of exchange ranging from extradition and mutual legal assistance to transit, railways and communications., india believes the future cooperation agenda can be energised in two broad ways: first, by introducing changes that improve the lives of people, and second, by altering its strategic setting by focussing on the big infrastructure sector issues of energy, ecology and connectivity that have not been addressed so far., >read: going beyond the ceremonial, about a fifth of nepal’s 28 million resident population lives and works in india. the open border is a “safety-valve” for nepal. without compromising india’s security, the challenge is to turn it into a bridge, not a barrier. mr. modi would do well to propose easing remittances and exchanging currencies, reducing telephone calling costs (calls from india and nepal to europe or the u.s. cost less than between the two neighbours), expanding educational opportunities, ensuring more dignified border crossings, increasing cross-border social and cultural linkages, improving road and rail transportation links, relaxing rules for border trade for private consumption, better managing the das gaja land at unmonitored border crossing points, and improving coordination between the respective border district officials for prompt resolution of local issues., medium to long-term prospectsthe big idea on the table is for nepal to simply tap power from the enormous body of waters that flow into the bay of bengal. hydropower generation in nepal is, unbelievably, less than half per cent of what can be produced. nepal can become, by far, the richest country of the subcontinent, on condition that it harnesses this resource. there is recognition in nepal today that this can transform the social and fiscal dynamics of nepal by its employment, energy and revenue generation potential., t.c.a. ranganathan, then the eximbank india chairman, had done some back of the envelope calculations for me that were startling. if nepal awarded production licensing for the development of over 8,000 mw of electricity offered eight years ago to independent power producers on the basis of competitive international bidding — most of them run-of-the-river projects avoiding large-scale inundation, displacement, compensation issues and ecological surprises — at the current rate of investment of $2 million/mw, the foreign direct investment (fdi) could be a staggering $16 billion. compare this to the $350 million actual inflow of fdi into nepal over the last 23 years. the free power for nepal, at a conservative rate of 12 per cent just from these projects, will be more than nepal’s total current production, besides free equity, royalties and taxes that will flow to its exchequer. if half of nepal’s hydro potential was to be harnessed, annual revenues could top $40 billion, over $100 million a day. mr. ranganathan said that in 20 years’ time his successor would have to visit kathmandu to raise capital for the bank and not go to new york or london for it.",0.07827713222450065,new template india-nepal ties,"nepalese leadership begrudged spurning repeated invitations visit kathmandu

2014-08-13,the javelin challenge,"the irony in >india-united states relations is that all the right things are said about them, and all the wrong things done. so while the two countries are said to be bound by virtue of being “the world’s largest democracy and the world’s oldest democracy,” a line unfailingly included in the speech of every visiting dignitary from the u.s., the reality is a big drift in bilateral ties. as the time nears for prime minister narendra modi’s visit to the white house in september, there is an apparent effort to ensure that his talks with president barack obama are productive. the pressure has grown on washington to show it wants to take bilateral ties forward under prime minister modi, who it had blacklisted while he was gujarat chief minister over the 2002 riots. the latest endeavour came from u.s. defense secretary chuck hagel, who arrived in new delhi shortly after secretary of state john kerry. after his meetings with mr. modi, external affairs minister sushma swaraj and finance and defence minister arun jaitley, mr. hagel pronounced himself convinced that the two sides “can transform our potential into results.” the main focus of his meetings was cooperation in the defence sector. india is the world’s largest importer of arms, and also among the biggest buyers of u.s. materiel. since 2008, new delhi has bought u.s. defence equipment worth nearly $10 billion and has been pushing for transfer of technology to manufacture those weapons here. mr. hagel appeared to concur, saying the way to transform defence ties would be to move “from simply buying and selling to co-production, co-development, and freer exchange of technology.”, declarations apart, the u.s. has a reputation for not being very reliable on precisely this aspect of its military partnerships. no agreements were announced during mr. hagel’s visit. the two sides, however, agreed to activate their stillborn 2012 defense trade and technology initiative. mr. hagel is said to have discussed a “pilot plan” to co-produce and co-develop the javelin anti-tank missile, manufactured by raytheon-lockheed martin. a team from the company had visited india some years ago, but drew the line at transferring technology to enable the system to be built locally. it is unclear if new delhi’s recent decision to increase the fdi limit in defence production from 26 to 49 per cent will be a game-changer. the limited hike has not received an effusive welcome from weapons contractors. a deal on the javelin would be far dearer than the spike, the israeli alternative the army has extensively tested and liked. still, mr. hagel’s offer should be put to the test, to check if the u.s. is serious about taking its military partnership with india to a higher level.",0.10505515989386956,javelin challenge,"irony >india-united states relations right things said , wrong things done. two countries said bound virtue “the world ’ largest democracy world ’ oldest democracy , ” line unfailingly included speech every visiting dignitary u.s. , reality big drift bilateral ties. time nears prime minister narendra modi ’ visit white house september , apparent effort ensure talks president barack obama productive. pressure grown washington show wants take bilateral ties forward prime minister modi , blacklisted gujarat chief minister 2002 riots. latest endeavour came u.s. defense secretary chuck hagel , arrived new delhi shortly secretary state john kerry. meetings mr. modi , external affairs minister sushma swaraj finance defence minister arun jaitley , mr. hagel pronounced convinced two sides “can transform potential results. ” main focus meetings cooperation defence sector. india world ’ largest importer arms , also among biggest buyers u.s. materiel. since 2008 , new delhi bought u.s. defence equipment worth nearly $ 10 billion pushing transfer technology manufacture weapons here. mr. hagel appeared concur , saying way transform defence ties would move “from simply buying selling co-production , co-development , freer exchange technology. ” , declarations apart , u.s. reputation reliable precisely aspect military partnerships. agreements announced mr. hagel ’ visit. two sides , however , agreed activate stillborn 2012 defense trade technology initiative. mr. hagel said discussed “pilot plan ” co-produce co-develop javelin anti-tank missile , manufactured raytheon-lockheed martin. team company visited india years ago , drew line transferring technology enable system built locally. unclear new delhi ’ recent decision increase fdi limit defence production 26 49 per cent game-changer. limited hike received effusive welcome weapons contractors. deal javelin would far dearer spike , israeli alternative army extensively tested liked. still , mr. hagel ’ offer put test , check u.s. serious taking military partnership india higher level .","{'bjp': 0, 'cong': 0}",0,0
2014-09-03,"at 100, more worries than hope","it is unfair to judge a new government and a new leader in just >100 days. it is silly to assess the changing mood of the nation or the state of the polity so soon after a landmark electoral verdict. yet, there is something we can do. we can notice a pattern in the priorities of the government, see the >direction of the new regime, say something about the style of the new leader and make an intelligent guess about future politics., going by this, the first 100 days of the narendra modi government offer more worries than hope. compared to the united progressive alliance (upa)-style paralysis, we see some welcome signs of movement. but the direction of this movement remains, at best, unclear, if not worrisome. it is good to see a leader with conviction, but we are already treading the thin line between decisiveness and authoritarianism. a government that lacks a clear direction and an opposition that lacks political will or wisdom threaten to deepen the political vacuum in the country., active foreign policylet us begin with the positives. a new government always kindles hopes and the >prime minister’s utterances have as yet not doused popular hopes. his speech in the central hall and independence day address were not visionary, but it was a relief to see a prime minister who looked into the eyes of his people and spoke his mind. he was down to earth, appeared to be outside the power elite of delhi, was concerned with issues that affect people in their everyday life and seemed willing to rise above the petty politics of a blame game. this powerful communication appears to have made up for his reluctance to face the media. and if opinion polls are anything to go by, his popularity and image have received a boost that every incumbent prime minister enjoys early on., the real question is: how do his utterances translate into action? this is where things get muddy. the one area where the new government has been somewhat inexplicably active is foreign policy. and there are many things to commend here: the invitation to the leaders of the south asian association for regional cooperation (saarc) for the prime minister’s swearing-in ceremony, the toning down of the imperious attitude towards nepal and a willingness to stand up to first-world bullying at the world trade organization (wto). at the same time, the new government has diluted further our principled stand on palestine, is unclear about what it wishes to do with brics and keeps sending conflicting signals about pakistan. there does not seem to be a coherent strategy underlying the >foreign policy activism of the modi government., electoral promisesmuch was expected on the economic front of the government that promised everything to everyone in the run-up to the election. the problem here is not a lack of coherence but that the emerging priorities of the government do not square up with its declared intent. more than the union budget — rightly described as a upa-iii budget — the government has unveiled its economic policy through a series of specific decisions. the willingness of the bharatiya janata party (bjp) to make a u-turn on its earlier opposition to foreign direct investment (fdi) in defence, railways and insurance shows its priorities. that’s why >a section of business seems to be happy and hopeful about this regime., but there is very little visible action on some of the big ticket and high decibel electoral promises. mr. modi had promised nothing short of controlling inflation and providing jobs to everyone. inaction on these aam aadmi concerns does not augur well for a government whose commitment to the poor is already suspect. in fact, the new government has gone back on some specific promises made to the aam aadmi. the bjp has already reneged on its manifesto promise to revise the minimum support price on the lines suggested by the swaminathan commission, viz., cost plus 50 per cent. the proposed dilution of the land acquisition, rehabilitation and resettlement act would reinforce the impression that farmers do not quite figure as a priority of this government., on futuristic sectors like the environment and education, it’s plain bad news so far. the government is keen to go back to the old days of growth-at-any-cost, throwing all environmental caution to the wind. hasty clearance for increasing the height of the sardar sarovar dam and the ken-betwa river linking project are mere symptoms of systematic damage to the regime of environmental protection carefully put together over the years. forest clearance norms have been relaxed, pollution standards have been diluted, the autonomy of the national board for wildlife has been compromised, and attempts are afoot to downgrade the green tribunal., >on education, it is not clear if the government has begun to understand the enormity of the challenge in this sector. forcing schoolchildren all over the country to stay back in order to listen to the prime minister on teacher’s day is no way to begin addressing the challenge of quality of education in the post-right to education (rte) era. occasional forays into higher education without a road map threaten to make an already bad situation much worse. while the government has not officially endorsed any of the loose talk about changing the curricula, the noise may have already begun to induce self-censorship, and thus curb innovation and creativity., religious harmonyone of the biggest fears associated with this government was its hostility to diversity, especially religious diversity. while the prime minister has been careful not to say anything that would accentuate this fear, the trouble is that he just has to be himself to make the minorities feel uneasy. given his image, the prime minister not hosting iftaar acquires more weight than his conciliatory words about communal harmony. the context of rising communal tension, especially in election-bound states, suggests that the arena of action has shifted outside the government. there appears to be crowd sourcing of communalism, with occasional and strategic help from the sangh parivar. an obsession with the short-term objective of winning haryana, maharashtra, jharkhand and at least the jammu region in jammu and kashmir has made the ruling party oblivious to the long-term cost of communal polarisation to the idea of india, and indeed to this regime itself.",0.04989385926183678,"100 , worries hope","unfair judge new government new leader >100 days. silly assess changing

2014-09-03,"at 100, more worries than hope","it is unfair to judge a new government and a new leader in just >100 days. it is silly to assess the changing mood of the nation or the state of the polity so soon after a landmark electoral verdict. yet, there is something we can do. we can notice a pattern in the priorities of the government, see the >direction of the new regime, say something about the style of the new leader and make an intelligent guess about future politics., going by this, the first 100 days of the narendra modi government offer more worries than hope. compared to the united progressive alliance (upa)-style paralysis, we see some welcome signs of movement. but the direction of this movement remains, at best, unclear, if not worrisome. it is good to see a leader with conviction, but we are already treading the thin line between decisiveness and authoritarianism. a government that lacks a clear direction and an opposition that lacks political will or wisdom threaten to deepen the political vacuum in the country., active foreign policylet us begin with the positives. a new government always kindles hopes and the >prime minister’s utterances have as yet not doused popular hopes. his speech in the central hall and independence day address were not visionary, but it was a relief to see a prime minister who looked into the eyes of his people and spoke his mind. he was down to earth, appeared to be outside the power elite of delhi, was concerned with issues that affect people in their everyday life and seemed willing to rise above the petty politics of a blame game. this powerful communication appears to have made up for his reluctance to face the media. and if opinion polls are anything to go by, his popularity and image have received a boost that every incumbent prime minister enjoys early on., the real question is: how do his utterances translate into action? this is where things get muddy. the one area where the new government has been somewhat inexplicably active is foreign policy. and there are many things to commend here: the invitation to the leaders of the south asian association for regional cooperation (saarc) for the prime minister’s swearing-in ceremony, the toning down of the imperious attitude towards nepal and a willingness to stand up to first-world bullying at the world trade organization (wto). at the same time, the new government has diluted further our principled stand on palestine, is unclear about what it wishes to do with brics and keeps sending conflicting signals about pakistan. there does not seem to be a coherent strategy underlying the >foreign policy activism of the modi government., electoral promisesmuch was expected on the economic front of the government that promised everything to everyone in the run-up to the election. the problem here is not a lack of coherence but that the emerging priorities of the government do not square up with its declared intent. more than the union budget — rightly described as a upa-iii budget — the government has unveiled its economic policy through a series of specific decisions. the willingness of the bharatiya janata party (bjp) to make a u-turn on its earlier opposition to foreign direct investment (fdi) in defence, railways and insurance shows its priorities. that’s why >a section of business seems to be happy and hopeful about this regime., but there is very little visible action on some of the big ticket and high decibel electoral promises. mr. modi had promised nothing short of controlling inflation and providing jobs to everyone. inaction on these aam aadmi concerns does not augur well for a government whose commitment to the poor is already suspect. in fact, the new government has gone back on some specific promises made to the aam aadmi. the bjp has already reneged on its manifesto promise to revise the minimum support price on the lines suggested by the swaminathan commission, viz., cost plus 50 per cent. the proposed dilution of the land acquisition, rehabilitation and resettlement act would reinforce the impression that farmers do not quite figure as a priority of this government., on futuristic sectors like the environment and education, it’s plain bad news so far. the government is keen to go back to the old days of growth-at-any-cost, throwing all environmental caution to the wind. hasty clearance for increasing the height of the sardar sarovar dam and the ken-betwa river linking project are mere symptoms of systematic damage to the regime of environmental protection carefully put together over the years. forest clearance norms have been relaxed, pollution standards have been diluted, the autonomy of the national board for wildlife has been compromised, and attempts are afoot to downgrade the green tribunal., >on education, it is not clear if the government has begun to understand the enormity of the challenge in this sector. forcing schoolchildren all over the country to stay back in order to listen to the prime minister on teacher’s day is no way to begin addressing the challenge of quality of education in the post-right to education (rte) era. occasional forays into higher education without a road map threaten to make an already bad situation much worse. while the government has not officially endorsed any of the loose talk about changing the curricula, the noise may have already begun to induce self-censorship, and thus curb innovation and creativity., religious harmonyone of the biggest fears associated with this government was its hostility to diversity, especially religious diversity. while the prime minister has been careful not to say anything that would accentuate this fear, the trouble is that he just has to be himself to make the minorities feel uneasy. given his image, the prime minister not hosting iftaar acquires more weight than his conciliatory words about communal harmony. the context of rising communal tension, especially in election-bound states, suggests that the arena of action has shifted outside the government. there appears to be crowd sourcing of communalism, with occasional and strategic help from the sangh parivar. an obsession with the short-term objective of winning haryana, maharashtra, jharkhand and at least the jammu region in jammu and kashmir has made the ruling party oblivious to the long-term cost of communal polarisation to the idea of india, and indeed to this regime itself.",0.04989385926183678,"100 , worries hope","unfair judge new government new leader >100 days. silly assess changing

maduravoyal, chennai-600095. rs. 1500.. | photo credit: scanned in chennai r.k.sridharan , “a more happy case was that of the versatile console system (vcs) for naval ships. d. lakshmi, the first recruited woman engineer of bel, handled this development and successfully completed it on time and within the budget. the first system was fitted during the modernisation of ins vikrant. the saree-clad lakshmi bravely navigated her way through the maze of cables and ladders typical of a ship under construction and successfully installed and commissioned the system., lakshmi also worked on transistorised gun control equipment for battle tanks. standing atop a fast-moving, revolving turret and testing the gun control equipment is not an easy job and certainly not considered a “womanly” job. but lakshmi completed the test successfully and won the admiration of the army personnel, who had earlier scoffed at her., s. rangarajan, better known as sujatha, and a leading writer of tamil fiction, was the computer engineer who developed the electronic voting machine which has made it possible for 130 crores of indians to vote in the general election without a glitch.”, such fascinating nuggets are found throughout the book “inside the solid state — the story of bharat electronics”., the story of bel is a welcome new arrival in the neglected genre of company histories in this country. this nearly 800-page volume not only chronicles the saga of one of the prized jewels in india’s public sector, it also addresses the key issues that confront hi-tech manufacturing in this country and offers a critique of the government’s policy regarding public enterprises. most of the published company histories turn out to be hagiographies of the bosses rather than objective chronicles of the enterprise, but this book differs., though primarily meant for serious students of business schools, the book also caters to the interested lay reader. the first thing that strikes the reader is the reader-friendly writing style. flavoured with anecdotes and laced with a dash of humour, it really reads like a story and despite its size, readers can navigate through the book thanks to the abstracts provided at the start of each chapter. the general reader can get a fair idea of the company’s history by reading through part i (the ceos). practising managers and students of management can go on to part ii (company’s strategies). and readers interested in electronics can go through the relevant chapters., the key factor for the company’s success is shown to be the company’s commitment towards developing indigenous technology as evidenced by the ratio of its r&d expenditure to sales, which is amongst the highest in the country. the book also reveals how bel was able to overcome the major challenge posed by the u.s. sanctions not only by the strength of its r&d but also by a bold ‘out of the box’ strategic decision to use ordinary commercial grade components in place of military grade components in some cases and redesign products without affecting their performance., other cases in which bel developed indigenous products in the face of foreign firms quoting unreasonable prices or trying to exploit monopoly situations, have also been outlined. a typical example is the case of the fly catcher radar., the book also deals with some of the major issues that confront india today. it emphasises the need to move away from conventional planning to multi-scenario planning. in a way, this has anticipated the recent decision of the government to abolish the planning commission., regarding fdi in manufacturing, the book cautions that the mere dismantling of the licence regime and opening of doors to foreign companies would not achieve much. foreign companies are unlikely to rush in unless the local outfit can offer substantial technological contribution by way of innovation or adaptation. in this context, the book gives a detailed account of the steps taken by china in the 1980s and 1990s for laying down high-class technology infrastructure., the government’s handling of public enterprises comes in for a frank appraisal in this book. despite being a top performer, the company was consistently denied a free hand not only in strategic decision-making but even in purely operational matters. when the company tied up with hewlett packard, a global leader in several hi-tech product lines, and was set to become its global manufacturing hub, the government scuttled the deal despite the company’s frantic appeals and this was at a time when china was entering into hundreds of such tie-ups in several fields., among the many instances cited in the book, “five ceos in a period of ten years” really takes the cake. even housemaids are rarely changed that often!, the company has generally been competently led but, two cmds, bv baliga and vk koshi have played key roles in critical periods and made bel the great success story it is today., but what about the future? with the defence sector thrown open to private firms and mncs — can bel hold its own? the answer is simple. will it be allowed a level playing field?, the book cites an instance where bel made a winning takeover offer but, by the time government approval came, a nimble-footed intruder from the private sector had pirated the chance away. this should not continue to happen. the approvals needed for a pse should be no more (and no less) than those for the private sector. can the modi government ensure this?",0.16283601850612164,story sterling public

2014-09-08,new highways to economic growth,"prime minister narendra modi made two crucial points in the context of india’s foreign policy on august 15, during his independence day address, and august 16, during the inauguration of two important infrastructural projects in maharashtra., on independence day, mr. modi spoke about the need for the south asian association for regional cooperation (saarc) countries to fight poverty together, rather than being engaged in meaningless conflict. the next day, speaking after the function to lay the foundation stone of the jawaharlal nehru port trust special economic zone at nhava sheva, he highlighted the need for state governments to become more active in exports and foreign direct investment (fdi). “we at the centre have to team up with the state governments for export promotion and the states should also work hard individually to help drive exports.” the prime minister also made the point that states should have their own export promotion councils and be more proactive in attracting foreign investment., early initiativesmr. modi’s statement on august 16 does not come as a surprise as when chief minister of gujarat, he took the lead in reaching out to the outside world, especially to countries in asia, like china, japan and singapore. during his chief ministership, not only did he visit these countries, but also began the “vibrant gujarat summit,” an annual event to showcase gujarat’s achievements. diplomats from a large number of countries attended this event, which began in 2003. during the election campaign in 2014, as well, he made some interesting suggestions with regard to foreign policy. he spoke about the possibility of having representatives of state governments in other countries for promotion of trade and commercial relations, a practice followed by many countries, including the united states. a number of u.s. states have trade offices located in different parts of the world. seventeen states have trade offices in china. in addition to this, sister city programmes have been used effectively by the u.s. ever since the programme was introduced in the 1950s., “for closer trade relations and increased connectivity, border states sharing contiguous borders with neighbouring countries need to become important stakeholders, not just those which are politically significant or are well-represented in parliament.” , over the past two decades, china, a country mr. modi looks up to, has also granted a reasonable amount of autonomy to provincial governments, with provinces having two organisations handling foreign relations. chen zhimin et al in an article titled “the provinces and china’s multi-layered diplomacy: the cases of gms and africa” (2010) written for the hague journal of diplomacy have explained the functions of both these organisations. while the foreign affairs office (fao) headed by the governor promotes people-to-people relations with other countries and handles issues such as visits by overseas delegations, economic ties with the outside world are handled through the foreign economic and trade commission (fetc). the trend of chinese provinces being proactive in economic diplomacy began after the economic reforms of the 1970s; the period of the 1980s and the 1990s were witness to visits by chinese governors to other countries including the u.s., and frequent exchanges at the provincial level., potential roadblocksstate governments reaching out to the outside world began in the 1990s, post-liberalisation of the economy, when chief minister of andhra pradesh, n. chandrababu naidu reached out to the u.s., and was able to attract investments from it giants like microsoft which began investing in hyderabad. the karnataka chief minister, s.m. krishna, also made an effort to woo foreign investors. the efforts by mr. naidu and mr. krishna helped in promoting hyderabad and bangalore as investment destinations. while hyderabad was on the itinerary of u.s. presidents bill clinton and george w. bush, bangalore was on the schedule of former chinese premier li peng, in 2001., while mr. modi’s ideas with regard to state involvement in external relations are interesting, he is likely to face a number of roadblocks., first, while the modi government may encourage interactions with countries like europe and southeast asia, it remains to be seen how mr. modi will view the participation of border states like those on the west (punjab, rajasthan and gujarat) vis-à-vis pakistan, and those bordering myanmar in the northeast. there is a strong possibility that in the case of countries like bangladesh and pakistan, security issues will overshadow matters pertaining to trade and people-to-people contact. this would be unfortunate, because over the past few years, some border states have been willing to play a constructive role in enhancing land connectivity and strengthening economic connectivity. in this context, tripura (bordering bangladesh) and punjab (pakistan) clearly stand out. for closer trade relations and increased connectivity, border states sharing contiguous borders with neighbouring countries need to become important stakeholders, not just those which are politically significant or are well-represented in parliament., ensuring balanced developmentsecond, mr. modi’s real success would be to ensure that states that are not industrialised develop links with the outside world and benefit from these linkages economically. currently, it is only a handful of economically developed states like delhi, gujarat, haryana, tamil nadu, karnataka and andhra pradesh which have reaped the benefits of economic diplomacy with the outside world. atri mukherjee, in a report titled “regional inequality in foreign direct investment flows to india: the problem and the prospects” (2011), written for the reserve bank of india (rbi), says that for the period between 2008-2009 and 2011-2012, these six states received 70 per cent fdi; delhi and maharashtra between themselves accounted for 50 per cent fdi., to get over this inequality, it is important not just to develop other states which have been left behind, but also encourage their participation in reaching out to the outside world., sub-national modelshere, mr. modi would do well to take a leaf out of the book of both the u.s. and chinese models of sub-national participation in economic diplomacy, where provinces which were not developed were given special attention. in the u.s., james c. cobb and william stueck in their book, globalization and the american south (2005), make the point that the southern states took the lead in reaching out to the outside world, as a consequence of which southern states began to lure a large number of foreign businesses by the 1980s and 1990s. if one were to look at the case of china, the catalyst for greater sub-regional participation in foreign policy was the opening up of the economy promoted by deng xiaoping and the 1982 constitution which granted greater authority to provinces. it is not just the coastal provinces which benefited from greater authority in economic matters but also border provinces like yunnan, which share borders with laos, myanmar and vietnam. only last year, a pipeline connecting myanmar (kyaukpyu) with china which passes via ruili in yunnan became functional. over the past decade, yunnan has also emerged as an important economic hub. kunming, the capital of the province, has been twinned with many cities including kolkata.",0.1042995839112344,new highways economic growth,"prime minister narendra modi made two crucial points context india ’ foreign policy august 15 , independence day address , august 16 , inauguration two important infrastructural projects maharashtra. , independence day , mr. modi spoke need south asian association regional cooperation ( saarc ) countries fight poverty together , rather engaged meaningless conflict. next day , speaking function lay foundation stone jawaharlal nehru port trust special economic zone nhava sheva , highlighted need state governments become active exports foreign direct investment ( fdi ) . “we centre team state governments export promotion states also work hard individually help drive exports. ” prime minister also made point states export promotion councils proactive attracting foreign investment. , early initiativesmr. modi ’ statement august 16 come surprise chief minister gujarat , took lead reaching outside world , especially countries asia , like china , japan singapore. chief ministership , visit countries , also began “vibrant gujarat summit , ” annual event showcase gujarat ’ achievements. diplomats large number countries attended event , began 2003. election campaign 2014 , well , made interesting suggestions regard foreign policy. spoke possibility representatives state governments countries promotion trade commercial relations , practice followed many countries , including united states. number u.s. states trade offices located different parts world. seventeen states trade offices china. addition , sister city programmes used effectively u.s. ever since programme introduced 1950s. , “for closer trade relations increased connectivity , border states sharing contiguous borders neighbouring countries need become important stakeholders , politically significant well-represented parliament. ” , past two decades , china , country mr. modi looks , also granted reasonable amount autonomy provincial governments , provinces two organisations handling foreign relations. chen zhimin et al article titled “the provinces china ’ multi-layered diplomacy : cases gms africa ” ( 2010 ) written hague journal diplomacy explained functions organisations. foreign affairs office ( fao ) headed governor promotes people-to-people relations countries handles issues visits overseas delegations , economic ties outside world handled foreign economic trade commission ( fetc ) . trend chinese provinces proactive economic diplomacy began economic reforms 1970s ;

transistorised gun control equipment for battle tanks. standing atop a fast-moving, revolving turret and testing the gun control equipment is not an easy job and certainly not considered a “womanly” job. but lakshmi completed the test successfully and won the admiration of the army personnel, who had earlier scoffed at her., s. rangarajan, better known as sujatha, and a leading writer of tamil fiction, was the computer engineer who developed the electronic voting machine which has made it possible for 130 crores of indians to vote in the general election without a glitch.”, such fascinating nuggets are found throughout the book “inside the solid state — the story of bharat electronics”., the story of bel is a welcome new arrival in the neglected genre of company histories in this country. this nearly 800-page volume not only chronicles the saga of one of the prized jewels in india’s public sector, it also addresses the key issues that confront hi-tech manufacturing in this country and offers a critique of the government’s policy regarding public enterprises. most of the published company histories turn out to be hagiographies of the bosses rather than objective chronicles of the enterprise, but this book differs., though primarily meant for serious students of business schools, the book also caters to the interested lay reader. the first thing that strikes the reader is the reader-friendly writing style. flavoured with anecdotes and laced with a dash of humour, it really reads like a story and despite its size, readers can navigate through the book thanks to the abstracts provided at the start of each chapter. the general reader can get a fair idea of the company’s history by reading through part i (the ceos). practising managers and students of management can go on to part ii (company’s strategies). and readers interested in electronics can go through the relevant chapters., the key factor for the company’s success is shown to be the company’s commitment towards developing indigenous technology as evidenced by the ratio of its r&d expenditure to sales, which is amongst the highest in the country. the book also reveals how bel was able to overcome the major challenge posed by the u.s. sanctions not only by the strength of its r&d but also by a bold ‘out of the box’ strategic decision to use ordinary commercial grade components in place of military grade components in some cases and redesign products without affecting their performance., other cases in which bel developed indigenous products in the face of foreign firms quoting unreasonable prices or trying to exploit monopoly situations, have also been outlined. a typical example is the case of the fly catcher radar., the book also deals with some of the major issues that confront india today. it emphasises the need to move away from conventional planning to multi-scenario planning. in a way, this has anticipated the recent decision of the government to abolish the planning commission., regarding fdi in manufacturing, the book cautions that the mere dismantling of the licence regime and opening of doors to foreign companies would not achieve much. foreign companies are unlikely to rush in unless the local outfit can offer substantial technological contribution by way of innovation or adaptation. in this context, the book gives a detailed account of the steps taken by china in the 1980s and 1990s for laying down high-class technology infrastructure., the government’s handling of public enterprises comes in for a frank appraisal in this book. despite being a top performer, the company was consistently denied a free hand not only in strategic decision-making but even in purely operational matters. when the company tied up with hewlett packard, a global leader in several hi-tech product lines, and was set to become its global manufacturing hub, the government scuttled the deal despite the company’s frantic appeals and this was at a time when china was entering into hundreds of such tie-ups in several fields., among the many instances cited in the book, “five ceos in a period of ten years” really takes the cake. even housemaids are rarely changed that often!, the company has generally been competently led but, two cmds, bv baliga and vk koshi have played key roles in critical periods and made bel the great success story it is today., but what about the future? with the defence sector thrown open to private firms and mncs — can bel hold its own? the answer is simple. will it be allowed a level playing field?, the book cites an instance where bel made a winning takeover offer but, by the time government approval came, a nimble-footed intruder from the private sector had pirated the chance away. this should not continue to happen. the approvals needed for a pse should be no more (and no less) than those for the private sector. can the modi government ensure this?",0.16283601850612164,story sterling public

2014-09-08,new highways to economic growth,"prime minister narendra modi made two crucial points in the context of india’s foreign policy on august 15, during his independence day address, and august 16, during the inauguration of two important infrastructural projects in maharashtra., on independence day, mr. modi spoke about the need for the south asian association for regional cooperation (saarc) countries to fight poverty together, rather than being engaged in meaningless conflict. the next day, speaking after the function to lay the foundation stone of the jawaharlal nehru port trust special economic zone at nhava sheva, he highlighted the need for state governments to become more active in exports and foreign direct investment (fdi). “we at the centre have to team up with the state governments for export promotion and the states should also work hard individually to help drive exports.” the prime minister also made the point that states should have their own export promotion councils and be more proactive in attracting foreign investment., early initiativesmr. modi’s statement on august 16 does not come as a surprise as when chief minister of gujarat, he took the lead in reaching out to the outside world, especially to countries in asia, like china, japan and singapore. during his chief ministership, not only did he visit these countries, but also began the “vibrant gujarat summit,” an annual event to showcase gujarat’s achievements. diplomats from a large number of countries attended this event, which began in 2003. during the election campaign in 2014, as well, he made some interesting suggestions with regard to foreign policy. he spoke about the possibility of having representatives of state governments in other countries for promotion of trade and commercial relations, a practice followed by many countries, including the united states. a number of u.s. states have trade offices located in different parts of the world. seventeen states have trade offices in china. in addition to this, sister city programmes have been used effectively by the u.s. ever since the programme was introduced in the 1950s., “for closer trade relations and increased connectivity, border states sharing contiguous borders with neighbouring countries need to become important stakeholders, not just those which are politically significant or are well-represented in parliament.” , over the past two decades, china, a country mr. modi looks up to, has also granted a reasonable amount of autonomy to provincial governments, with provinces having two organisations handling foreign relations. chen zhimin et al in an article titled “the provinces and china’s multi-layered diplomacy: the cases of gms and africa” (2010) written for the hague journal of diplomacy have explained the functions of both these organisations. while the foreign affairs office (fao) headed by the governor promotes people-to-people relations with other countries and handles issues such as visits by overseas delegations, economic ties with the outside world are handled through the foreign economic and trade commission (fetc). the trend of chinese provinces being proactive in economic diplomacy began after the economic reforms of the 1970s; the period of the 1980s and the 1990s were witness to visits by chinese governors to other countries including the u.s., and frequent exchanges at the provincial level., potential roadblocksstate governments reaching out to the outside world began in the 1990s, post-liberalisation of the economy, when chief minister of andhra pradesh, n. chandrababu naidu reached out to the u.s., and was able to attract investments from it giants like microsoft which began investing in hyderabad. the karnataka chief minister, s.m. krishna, also made an effort to woo foreign investors. the efforts by mr. naidu and mr. krishna helped in promoting hyderabad and bangalore as investment destinations. while hyderabad was on the itinerary of u.s. presidents bill clinton and george w. bush, bangalore was on the schedule of former chinese premier li peng, in 2001., while mr. modi’s ideas with regard to state involvement in external relations are interesting, he is likely to face a number of roadblocks., first, while the modi government may encourage interactions with countries like europe and southeast asia, it remains to be seen how mr. modi will view the participation of border states like those on the west (punjab, rajasthan and gujarat) vis-à-vis pakistan, and those bordering myanmar in the northeast. there is a strong possibility that in the case of countries like bangladesh and pakistan, security issues will overshadow matters pertaining to trade and people-to-people contact. this would be unfortunate, because over the past few years, some border states have been willing to play a constructive role in enhancing land connectivity and strengthening economic connectivity. in this context, tripura (bordering bangladesh) and punjab (pakistan) clearly stand out. for closer trade relations and increased connectivity, border states sharing contiguous borders with neighbouring countries need to become important stakeholders, not just those which are politically significant or are well-represented in parliament., ensuring balanced developmentsecond, mr. modi’s real success would be to ensure that states that are not industrialised develop links with the outside world and benefit from these linkages economically. currently, it is only a handful of economically developed states like delhi, gujarat, haryana, tamil nadu, karnataka and andhra pradesh which have reaped the benefits of economic diplomacy with the outside world. atri mukherjee, in a report titled “regional inequality in foreign direct investment flows to india: the problem and the prospects” (2011), written for the reserve bank of india (rbi), says that for the period between 2008-2009 and 2011-2012, these six states received 70 per cent fdi; delhi and maharashtra between themselves accounted for 50 per cent fdi., to get over this inequality, it is important not just to develop other states which have been left behind, but also encourage their participation in reaching out to the outside world., sub-national modelshere, mr. modi would do well to take a leaf out of the book of both the u.s. and chinese models of sub-national participation in economic diplomacy, where provinces which were not developed were given special attention. in the u.s., james c. cobb and william stueck in their book, globalization and the american south (2005), make the point that the southern states took the lead in reaching out to the outside world, as a consequence of which southern states began to lure a large number of foreign businesses by the 1980s and 1990s. if one were to look at the case of china, the catalyst for greater sub-regional participation in foreign policy was the opening up of the economy promoted by deng xiaoping and the 1982 constitution which granted greater authority to provinces. it is not just the coastal provinces which benefited from greater authority in economic matters but also border provinces like yunnan, which share borders with laos, myanmar and vietnam. only last year, a pipeline connecting myanmar (kyaukpyu) with china which passes via ruili in yunnan became functional. over the past decade, yunnan has also emerged as an important economic hub. kunming, the capital of the province, has been twinned with many cities including kolkata.",0.1042995839112344,new highways economic growth,"prime minister narendra modi made two crucial points context india ’ foreign policy august 15 , independence day address , august 16 , inauguration two important infrastructural projects maharashtra. , independence day , mr. modi spoke need south asian association regional cooperation ( saarc ) countries fight poverty together , rather engaged meaningless conflict. next day , speaking function lay foundation stone jawaharlal nehru port trust special economic zone nhava sheva , highlighted need state governments become active exports foreign direct investment ( fdi ) . “we centre team state governments export promotion states also work hard individually help drive exports. ” prime minister also made point states export promotion councils proactive attracting foreign investment. , early initiativesmr. modi ’ statement august 16 come surprise chief minister gujarat , took lead reaching outside world , especially countries asia , like china , japan singapore. chief ministership , visit countries , also began “vibrant gujarat summit , ” annual event showcase gujarat ’ achievements. diplomats large number countries attended event , began 2003. election campaign 2014 , well , made interesting suggestions regard foreign policy. spoke possibility representatives state governments countries promotion trade commercial relations , practice followed many countries , including united states. number u.s. states trade offices located different parts world. seventeen states trade offices china. addition , sister city programmes used effectively u.s. ever since programme introduced 1950s. , “for closer trade relations increased connectivity , border states sharing contiguous borders neighbouring countries need become important stakeholders , politically significant well-represented parliament. ” , past two decades , china , country mr. modi looks , also granted reasonable amount autonomy provincial governments , provinces two organisations handling foreign relations. chen zhimin et al article titled “the provinces china ’ multi-layered diplomacy : cases gms africa ” ( 2010 ) written hague journal diplomacy explained functions organisations. foreign affairs office ( fao ) headed governor promotes people-to-people relations countries handles issues visits overseas delegations , economic ties outside world handled foreign economic trade commission ( fetc ) . trend chinese provinces proactive economic diplomacy began economic reforms 1970s ;

shop in india. these captives and their service providers together have created a globally exposed and competent workforce in india in addition to a new wealthy class of a few white collared professionals. the positive impact that this has made to the country is significant and real, even if it is limited to a small percentage of the population. to replicate this success in manufacturing seems a worthy objective, but with lessons from the past, we can and should aim higher., innovation has two beneficiaries — producers and consumers. for example, creating the light bulb was a profitable venture for thomas alva edison but it also benefitted millions of consumers with the innovation., sharing valuein most cases, the knowledge workers seem to be pursuing problems of their employers in western countries. the output of their work often tends to be irrelevant in india. thus in this increasingly interconnected world, one can effectively create islands of producers and consumers that are far removed from each other. the value created is shared by a few producers in india and a lot of consumers in western countries. the recent ‘make in india’ campaign is trying to extend this trend into manufacturing from services., there is a silver lining to this approach. while the output of what workers create is removed from the needs of their country of residence, the skills and capacity that they develop in the process are transferable. for example, workers from the very same pool, using similar tools and processes, created the first of its kind unique identification project in india. aadhar aims to give a billion unique biometric ids to indian residents and has already achieved half of its target within a few years., however, where government policies in attracting more fdi and in encouraging the indian outsourcing industry have been a success, the track record in encouraging companies to innovate and make in india and for india has been poor. with a dismal rank in the ease of doing business index, there is a systemic advantage that existing businesses enjoy versus the problems that new innovative companies seeking to disrupt them have to face. however, improving the country’s rank on this well-established score doesn’t seem to be an important priority for the indian government. apart from the many sound bites, no concrete action is forthcoming., the track record in encouraging companies to make in india and for india has been poor , the initiative of implementing a uniform goods and services tax will do more to create an integrated domestic market than anything else. equally important is to be able to move goods across state borders without being subjected to harassment., however, an export-oriented manufacturing policy sidesteps this issue since the goods produced will mostly go out. another key issue in india is a broken credit system that makes it difficult for new businesses to raise debt. the ‘make in india’ initiative will even further tilt the balance in favour of large domestic firms that hog all credit and can also tap international markets or foreign firms that have better access to capital in their home country. these are barely two in a long list of reforms that india awaits., software as a servicewe can already see examples that frustrate businesses trying to make for india in the software sector. the recent trend of delivering software as a service has proved to be an ideal solution for a capital-scarce country where consumers and small businesses are happier with a pay-as-you-go system rather than investing upfront for using software tools. however, the one thing that such businesses need — an ability to easily collect recurring payments online — is tedious in india. this makes it is easier for an indian company to serve customers in the u.s. than in india. this is tragic, apart from being strange.",0.11026526664824536,"make india , india","ase business :

2014-11-09,jaitley vows to push land purchase reform,"union finance minister arun jaitley during the opening session of the india economic summit in new delhi. file photo , india will push ahead with reform to a land purchase law blamed by business for slowing industrial projects, even if there is resistance to loosening the rules, finance minister arun jaitley said on sunday., mr. jaitley said changes to the law were needed to fulfil prime minister narendra modi's vision of building 100 new ""smart"" cities across india., ""some changes will be necessary, we will first attempt to reach a consensus, if that's not possible we will go ahead and take the decision,"" jaitley said, speaking at a seminar in new delhi., the law was passed last year with support of bjp when it was in opposition, and seeks to set fair compensation for loss of livelihood for farmers who sell their land to industrial or infrastructure projects., but its complex procedures have made it very hard for large-scale industrial projects to acquire the land they need., the bjp would need parliamentary approval to change the law, and might struggle in the upper house where it does not have a majority., mr. jaitley also said he hoped to begin a delayed programme to sell stakes in government owned companies ""in the next couple of days"". he said the government was aiming to bring down its equity in public sector banks to about 52 per cent., hopeful of passage of insurance bill in winter session, mr. jaitley expressed hope that the long-pending insurance laws amendment bill, which seeks to raise the fdi cap in the sector to 49 per cent, will get the parliament approval in the upcoming winter session., “we have opened up investments in various sectors. i do hope this (winter) session i will be able to pass the insurance bill,” he said at the india global forum meeting here., the month-long winter session of parliament is scheduled to commence from november 24., fdi in the sector is capped at 26 per cent at present., the much-delayed insurance bill has been referred to the select committee of parliament. the bill, which comes with a rider that the management control would rest in the hands of indian promoter, has been pending since 2008 in the rajya sabha., the minister said india is pursuing the policy of allowing foreign investment with sectoral cap keeping in mind the requirements of the economy and the appetite of the indian political system., “when we were in the government last time we opened up the sector. at that time, the political system had an appetite for a limited opening. we are now opening up the sector a little more,” he added., bowing to opposition pressure, the government had in august agreed to refer the insurance bill to the 15-member select committee. the committee is expected to submit its report by the third week of november., the reform, according to experts, could increase the flow of foreign investment to the tune of rs 25,000 crore into the private insurance companies. the move would help insurance firms to get the much-needed capital from overseas partners., there are about two dozen private sector insurance firms, both in life and non-life segment in the country., govt in final stages of discussions with states on gst, hinting that amendments to the goods and services tax (gst) may be introduced in the ensuing winter session of parliament, mr. jaitley said the government was in the final stages of talks with states on the issue., “i am in the last stage of my discussion with the states on the eve of parliament session before introducing the amendments to the gst law in parliament,” jaitley said at the india global forum meeting here., the month-long winter session of parliament is scheduled to commence on

2015-01-19,"railways needs private capital, not privatisation: suresh prabhu","minister for railways suresh prabhakar prabhu on monday said while the railways badly needed private capital, there was no way it could mean privatisation of any kind whatsoever., “the indian railways will continue to be owned by government of india only. it will not go into the hands of multi-nationals. there are no second thoughts about it. we need to decongest our network by doubling, tripling or even quadrupling lines wherever we can. in urban areas it could only mean we go above the road. as two-thirds of our revenue comes from freight, we are going for dedicated freight corridors,” he said., he was addressing a gathering of railway officials and representatives from the private sector including infrastructure, services sector and technology companies, at the 15 national seminar on 'ppp and fdi in indian railways’. it was organised by the centre for transportation research and management (ctram) and hosted by the south central railways at the indian railway institute of signal engineering and telecommunication (iriset) here., mr. suresh prabhu wanted all stakeholders to think and come up with out-of-the-box solutions. “i do not want problems, only solutions. i can tell you a hundred reasons why we cannot do a particular thing, but you tell me how we can go about raising the enormous funds required to fund our infrastructure projects. indian railways is a vital growth engine that cannot be neglected,” he said, pointing out how china invested 12 per cent of its funds on its railways and how it was leading to economic growth., governor of andhra pradesh and telangana, e.s.l. narasimhan said it was imperative for propagating the reason why indian railways needed public-private partnership. “foreign direct investment (fdi) had become an absolute necessity. out networks are getting choked. we need specific guidelines to clearly demarcate areas where fdi is required. prioritisation is important. we cannot take up every project at one go. indian railways will not go into foreign hands,” he stated., mr. narasimhan said infrastructure issues apart, the indian railways could leverage technology to address problems and improve safety, security and services. “why cant the common train traveller get good, hot food on board ?

on sunday and will be the first american president to attend republic day celebrations on january 26. , when u.s. president barack obama touches down in new delhi on air force one this weekend both he and his chief indian interlocutor, prime minister narendra modi, will carry a heavy burden of expectations upon their shoulders., while some may be distracted by the “optics” of their second meeting, which includes a republic day salute to mr. obama from india’s armed forces, a visit to raj ghat, a state dinner, a ceos forum discussion and a speech by the american president, long-time observers of the bilateral space will be watching for breakthroughs in the broad policy agenda., boost to defence cooperation, the view appears optimistic in one area of cooperation above all others – defence trade. sadanand dhume of washington’s american enterprise institute suggested to the hindu that the promise for the most dramatic gains could be found in this sphere, even more so after “notoriously inert” former defence minister a.k. antony was replaced by the “dynamic” manohar parrikar of the bjp government., here unintentional reciprocity may have brought the right partners to the table on both sides as the new u.s. defence secretary ashton carter is reputed to be a man who fundamentally supports deeper engagement with india, in a way that some of his predecessors did not., could the last year’s defence trade and technology initiative be the fertile ground that yields the much-needed moment of bilateral epiphany?, milan vaishnav of the carnegie endowment for international peace argued that with fresh momentum imparted to the talks by these leaders there is a “reasonable chance” that two sides will come to agreement on a deal to co-produce and co-develop a new piece of defence hardware, defying the long-standing bugaboo of technology transfer and attendant insecurities., economy a core concern, trade and investment in some ways comprise the very heart of the india-u.s. engagement, at least since mr. modi took over at the helm in south block., with the two nations meeting in november for the trade policy forum, launching an infrastructure collaboration platform in december and discussing the “formidable” goals of the prime minister’s digital india vision this month, the space has seen a flurry of activity aimed to consolidating the economic partnership even further., notwithstanding the promise of this economic diplomacy and the hope that the gradual lifting of foreign direct investment caps in india will create jobs from seattle to sriperumbudur, some lingering concerns remain., among these, as u.s. assistant secretary of state for economic and business affairs charles rivkin said at several forums here in recent weeks, there is a view that the intellectual property rights protection regime in india is “philosophically” different to its u.s. counterpart., while the broad expectation is that ipr and trade protection concerns are unlikely to go away any time soon, the action that truly set alarm bells ringing in washington’s beltway appears to be the signalling effect of india’s refusal to sign the world trade organisation’s trade facilitation agreement until an agreement was reached on food subsidies., in this regard, mr. dhume says, “though the u.s. and india have resolved their disagreement over the wto’s tfa, india has ended up reinforcing its image among u.s. trade officials as a spoiler on global trade.”, although getting the tfa back on track was an important step, there are a host of thorny issues, including trade protectionism, ipr and immigration and, “the biggest thing obama is seeking is credible reassurance on the economic reform front,” noted mr. vaishnav., how to assure washington of this commitment to continued liberalisation?, in the short and medium term mr. obama may broadly seek assurances that the prime minister’s economic nationalism is not a “synonym for renewed protectionism,” and it may help if the indian government continued to prioritise fdi flows and improve the ease of doing business., in the longer term the obama white house and any administration occupying that building after 2016 will be looking to ensure that american companies can partner with india on mega-scale economic initiatives such as “make in india” and “digital india.”, civil nuclear dilemma, the 2008 civilian nuclear cooperation agreement between india and the u.s., which used to be the barometer of goodwill between the nations and was a de facto nod to indian exceptionalism, has gotten mired in the tussle over india’s nuclear liability act and has witnessed much hand-wringing around the use of administrative rules to limit supplier liability in the event of an accident., could the modi-obama parleys resolve this riddle of the sphinx over a weekend?, the view in washington seems to be this: it may not matter., praise, or at least cautious optimism, is already accruing to the modi government for adopting a “problem solving approach” especially given the obama administration’s frustrations with the perceived intransigence of some in the upa-ii regime on the liability question., meeting of minds?, finally a factor that may have a strong influence on the outcomes of bilateral engagement, even if it is not officially a part of the agenda, is the chemistry between mr. modi and mr. obama., while the two men are viewed by some as the odd couple of global politics, mr. dhume argues, “nobody would have predicted that the bookish former law professor would find common ground with the business-friendly former rss pracharak but the two leaders do appear to have developed a degree of personal warmth toward each other.”, ultimately, the consensus here appears to be, it is common interests, whether maintaining the balance of power in asia, developing india's economy or combating terrorism, that drive the bonhomie between mr. obama and

2015-01-23,going beyond bonhomie,"visits to india by world leaders are routinely high profile events. a visit by the president of the united states has the added attraction of high expectations. president barack obama’s coming visit — the second during his presidency — has raised expectations by several notches and greatly raised the stakes, coming as it does so soon after prime minister narendra modi’s highly successful visit to the u.s., u.s. presidents, in their second term, tend to be generally more expansive in their attitude towards india than during their first term. presidents bill clinton and george w. bush demonstrated this in ample measure. mr. obama did not, however, wait for his second term to demonstrate his desire to strengthen the relationship with india. the effusive welcome that he afforded former prime minister manmohan singh in 2009, including holding his first state banquet in honour of the indian leader is part of diplomatic folklore in washington and new delhi., mr. obama would no doubt retain warm memories of the tumultuous reception he received when he addressed the indian parliament during his visit in 2010. the visit, in effect, demonstrated that the era of estranged democracies had come to an end and the era of engaged democracies had come into being. this time, if anything, a warmer welcome awaits him, as the first u.s. president to be the chief guest at the republic day celebrations on january 26., ‘natural allies, global partners’ in contrast, visits of indian prime ministers to washington have generally been low key and strictly limited to the business on hand. mr. modi broke this mould during his september 2014 visit to the u.s. his was a visit rich in symbolism and, at times, as in the case of his madison square garden appearance, a high profile media event. this was among the many departures from established practice and protocol that mr. modi effected with excellent results., “the coming two years are critical if india and the u.s. are to achieve the full potential in terms of their relationship.”, it is difficult to see how the rhetoric employed by both sides during the prime minister’s visit to the u.s. can be bettered. on his part, mr. modi went much beyond former prime minister a.b. vajpayee’s reference to india and the u.s. as being “natural allies,” and substantially raised the bar when he said that india and the u.s. are “natural global partners” embodying the enduring and universal relevance of their shared values. the prime minister further added that the complementary strengths of india and the u.s. could be used for inclusive and broad-based global development to transform lives across the world., there is considerable scope, however, for fine-tuning many of the issues that were discussed in washington — which require satisfactory closure — such as clean energy, the bilateral investment treaty, climate change issues, wto-related matters, foreign direct investment (fdi) and intellectual property rights. none of these items is however likely “to set the jamuna on fire.” renewal of the defence framework agreement (first signed in 2005 as a prelude to the visit of dr. singh to washington) and the defence technology and trade initiative again will hardly amount to a breakthrough in relations that both sides seek. this is the age of teleology, and the second modi-obama summit will in all likelihood be judged by the quality of the dialogue rather than the number of agreements signed., visits and the results there are certain inherent risks connected with high profile visits and summit diplomacy. seldom do they lead to anticipated results. india-u.s. relations are replete with instances of this kind. old-timers will recall the excitement concerning u.s. president eisenhower’s visit to india in 1959, only to be followed soon thereafter by a u.s. “tilt” towards pakistan, and a stream of military and other forms of aid to that country. mr. clinton’s visit to india during his second term did lead to a perceptible thaw in india-u.s. relations, but the visit itself did not produce a new dawn in terms of the relationship., on the other hand, low key visits do sometimes produce dramatic results. dr. singh’s visit to washington in 2005 hardly compares with that of mr. modi’s in 2014 in terms of coverage and publicity, but the results were near transformational. the first significant breach in the “nuclear great wall,” leading to the dismantling of the nuclear apartheid regime occurred during this visit., likewise, the visit of president bush to india in 2006 hardly compares with the kind of adulation showered on his successor, but it produced a critical breakthrough relating to the separation plan (viz., separation of india’s strategic military weapons programme from its civilian nuclear programme), an essential component for finalisation of the india-u.s. nuclear deal. the personal involvement of the u.s. president and the indian prime minister was crucial for this, as at one stage negotiations had virtually collapsed., dr. singh’s visit to the u.s. in 2009 — another low key visit — led to taking the final step, thus paving the way for india to trade in nuclear materials with countries across the globe. this was a one-of-a-kind international agreement, seldom seen in the diplomatic history of nations., it is not often in a generation that an opportunity for a meeting of minds of this kind occurs. mr. obama and mr. modi must, hence, set their sights high, to try and produce a transformational impact. without belittling the efforts needed to sort out prickly issues such as the “nuclear liability law” (which has been holding up india-u.s. nuclear cooperation), as also other steps required to enhance the political and military dialogue further by renewing the u.s.-india defence framework agreement for another ten years, the opportunity provided by the summit should be utilised for some “big ticket” items., the world is, today, at a tipping point. at one level, geography and nationalism are striking back with renewed vigour. across continents, nations appear to be reverting to the syndrome of fractured smaller states (already evident in west asia). there is a growing arc of violence and upheavals in regions like west asia. as radicalist ideas and beliefs gain ascendancy in the region and beyond, the spectre of asymmetric warfare and terrorism haunts many regions., china’s assertiveness at another level, the world has to take note of china’s increasing assertiveness — not only in dealing with issues directly affecting its territorial claims — but going well beyond the “nine-dash-lines” that it had historically limited itself to. there are again signs of a growing rapprochement between russia and china, with “oil diplomacy” paving the way for reinforcement of military ties. the intention is possibly to counter the u.s. pivot towards asia, but the russia-china axis will have an impact elsewhere as well, including in west asia, of eroding the influence of countries like the u.s. and india. internal developments in china, even as president xi jinping seeks to emerge as china’s most powerful leader since deng xiaoping, also merit careful assessment.",0.13071771462860576,going beyond bonhomie,"visits india world leaders routinely high

2015-01-28,chat - as it happened: obama's india visit,"varghese george (national and political affairs editor); amit baruah (resident editor, new delhi) ; suhasini haidar (diplomatic and strategic affairs editor); narayan lakshman (the hindu's u.s. correspondent); puja mehra (special correspondent) share their insights and answer readers' questions relating to mr. obama's india visit, the hindu: welcome to the hindu's live chat on us president obama's visit to india. following mr. obama's visit , it is time to understand what this historic visit means for india, for the u.s., this region and more importantly for the people of both countries, the hindu: did you know that mr. obama was the first u.s. president to be the chief guest at the republic day? read the top 10 highlights of the president's visit here: http://www.thehindu.com/news/top-10-highlights-of-obamas-visit-to-india/article6826353.ece, comment from veera reddy: “mann ki bath” would have been great if modi allowed obama more time to speak......disappoited......, a: amit baruah: welcome to the hindu's live chat on the obama visit. keep your questions coming, you have the hindu's top brass waiting to respond, suhasini haidar: good morning all….welcome to the hindu live chat…happy to take your questions and comments!, q: with new big investments in economy and infrastructure on the anvil, can we expect to see as a fundamental principle, the upholding of environmental and industrial safety, risk management in all the new developments?, puja mehra: good morning all, q: was there talks about the h1 visa and outsourcing? when can we get what was discussed in detail?, suhasini haidar: they did talk..president obama said he had “noted india's concerns” so expect it to come up once they launch the bilateral investment talks as well, narayan lakshman: welcome folks. this is narayan lakshman,the hindu's u.s. correspondent., q: after out come of us india meetings is there any time lines mentioned or target dates announced on e.g smart cities. neuclear power, solar engery...etc, a: suhasini haidar: not yet…on nuclear issues, india is expected to reply “within days” on us concerns over reading the liability law. on solar energy, its still a broad, not significant commitment. but under pace and peace programmes, expect something before november!, a: narayan lakshman: on timeline for the nuclear deal, i would add that it may be much longer before any investment in u.s.-made reactors is finalised, particularly because the u.s. nuclear companies like westinghouse and ge need to make their own risk assessments based on the pooled insurance formula that has been put on the table by the indian side. if they decide that the premium costs would result in too high a price of power generated, it may require further negotiations., comment from gubi : i think there was more hype about this visit in india,us media did not pay any heed to visit., q: what are the main benefits india will have after obama's visit?, comment: absolute nil coverage in major usa tv evening news of nbc, cbs & abc of obamas india visit!, a: suhasini haidar: really….well thats quite surprising, given the optics of the visit. but maybe thats how it often is, a: narayan lakshman: i agree. there's a view that u.s. media is predominantly focused on domestic concerns, which i would attest to, to an extent. having said that the print media here did offer more coverage than television, with pretty much every major publication following the visit in real time., q: i have the opinion that us media did not give much attention for this visit primarily as they don't see this visit of importance in strategy. they consider this visit as a wooing by india to improve its relations with usa. however, the indian perspective is that during obama's visit india has already accomplished some crucial breakthrough in terms of us aid and us support politically for india. what is your take on this?, a: suhasini haidar: i think it is a significant visit, but it will take some weeks, maybe months to see just what was achieved. if the big picture is that us and india are now heading towards an alliance, that might face a backlash…but as partners going forward, they can achieve a lot, a: amit baruah: responses from pakistan and the official chinese media are interesting. they suggest that the obama visit has had more than the “optical” impact regionally, q: is the us congress behind obama on his act east policy with respect to india ???, a: narayan lakshman: yes, i believe it is, in the sense that india is by and large considered a country with bipartisan support here. further, the u.s. congress (or specific members) has (have) often been more concerned about the rise of china than the white house has. so they can be expected to back most of obama's policies on india in east asia., q: suhasini, will india really go with usa in fighting against terrorism? and against isis? by sending combating troops.., a: suhasini haidar: i doubt that praveen! isis is something india has shied away from commenting on. but they need to have real cooperation, as equals. see my piece if possible in today’s @thehindu on jud ., a: narayan lakshman: this is a really good question, and one that many in the media are not picking up. i think the obama administration must have been hoping for some greater involvement by india -- but it has not been forthcoming. in some sense, there is a standoff brewing in that regard -- us refusing to mention let, jud in joint statement, as suhasini said, and india not yielding on the fight against isis/is/daesh, q: was the obama speech against putin prompted by a afp journalist warranted?, a: amit baruah: obama's comments on russia were quite deliberate. they were an effort to show that once friendly to russia-ussr india was now a stage that could be used against moscow. that, to me, was the broad purpose of his comments against russia., q: need clarification about the supplier liability in n-deal after this visit., a: suhasini haidar: yes i agree, vivek!, q: suhasini - when he spoke about freedom of religion... what and how is it seen by the ruling party., puja mehra: the task forces appointed on the agreement to develop smart cities will give their reports in three months time.., q: suhasini , why the news that india has been endorsed for un security counsil permanent seat by usa , is not making much news ? i read in dawn about the concern raised by pakistan security adviser on this and other but why this is not in news here ?, a: suhasini haidar: not the first time president obama has made the statement….he said “we hope to see a reformed unsc in which india has a seat”. but no process for reform is in play yet. 10:09, a: puja mehra: they will submit concrete plans for development, funding required, q: how is us going to gain from the nuclear deal with india considering that all the major corporations like mitsubishi and all from other countries., a: narayan lakshman: the u.s. has quite a lot to gain, in terms of jobs created here by deals involving westinghouse and ge. further there it cements the strategic bond with india further as this policy was the “centrepiece” of the relationship since 2005., q: what about totalisation agreement of 3 billion indian money that is tied up in us social security?, a: narayan lakshman: this has apparently returned to the negotiating table during obama's visit, having reached a stand-still for several years now, since the upa gov. still unclear if any rapid resolution of the issues is possible, as it hinges upon taxation (and other financial) systems of the two nations becoming more closely coordinated (and right now they're not), q: will this mean indian troops in afghanistan, syria, yemen, central asia and congo. i mean unofficially bypassing the un, a: amit baruah: nope, don't think so abraham. closer military cooperation with the us will not amount to that. there are no indications to suggest that now., q: how do you think china india relations will play out in next 4-5 years? india-us bhai-bhai and china-india ---- (what?), a: suhasini haidar: i think pm modi has taken a very definitive stand on countering china over the past few months in relns with japan, australia, vietnam and the us. this is going to make our engagement with china, which is india's largest trading partner tricky. eam sushma swaraj is heading to beijing next week, pm modi will probably go later this year, so hopefully this will be managed., q: will india's dream of securing a seat in un security council materialise?, q: is there any merit in china's warning of “trap” by usa?, a: amit baruah: the chinese have concerns about the india-us tango in the region -- that's clear from their media editorials. the “trap” , however, could be in the chinese mind alone., a: puja mehra: president obama did say that us companies saw an opportunity in india's infrastructure development plans. on make in india he said the steps india was taking for improving the ease of doing business were a step in the right direction. he said us companies would like to see more done on intellectual rights protection., q: apart from all the deals and other shining things, we the indians, as strong supporters of democracy and human rights, did not dare anytime (either our visit to us or their visit to us) to discuss issues of human massacres in the name of regime change in palestine, syria etc. supported by us. this same us doesnt want to bring democracy in saudi arabia as that is its ally. this double standard of us is well accepted and cherished by all. obama is welcomed everywhere and no one dares to debate about it to them. we are still scared to speak out. thats a sign of our weakness. nuke deal wil leab us nowhere unless we start to assert ourselves on the right things., a: suhasini haidar: i do agree that us needs to be called out more on its actions in west asia, especially iraq, libya and syria. disagree that its our weakness that stops us though., q: how this improved india's proximity with usa will affect our equation with russia and china?, a: amit baruah: i think that maintaining good relations with all key powers and acting in our own national interest would make for a sound foreign policy., q: china already made their stand by calling pak a true friend..how russia responded to this...?, a: suhasini haidar: china wants a much deeper engagement with india too….all relations mustn't be seen as zero-sum, q: i am wondering at some political commentators observations that upa failed to seal this nuclear deal even before getting to know about the specifics involved. upa could have also made it, had they given up on liability clause. if modi govt has surrendered on this liability issue, then i dont think it is a major foreign policy achievement as seen by some excited fellows on tv debates., a: suhasini haidar: i agree with you…and i think we need to give the government time on making it clear exactly what they have given by way of assurances in order to take the deal forward, q: will the backing of us for a permanent seat in the security council mean anything, when we know that china will veto the proposal in the end anyways?, a: amit baruah: on the previous occasion, when india had a shot at entering the unsc, both china and the united states worked actively on african countries to ensure that entry did not happen!!, q: we are hearing that we will get seat in security council for last 10 years when they are going to decide or reform the council ?, a: suhasini haidar: un secy général has asked the unga spl committee to give its report, probably this year. lets see how much longer after that!, q: given president obama's remaining tenure is pretty much lame duck, how sustainable are the arrangements and understandings reached during this visit ?, a: narayan lakshman: good question. the arrangements will be sustainable if nothing because india enjoys bipartisan support here in the u.s. second, once a policy such as the nuclear deal has been operationalised, it is very hard for the u.s. to undo it, possibly involving protracted legal wrangling and negotiations in congress, something that the next occupant of the white house, whichever party they're from, will seek to avoid. also, it will upset new delhi!, q: will there be any bad impact on already stressed relations in the south asia because of this visit??, a: amit baruah: certainly, the pakistanis are far from pleased and unhappy at obama gracing india's military might on republic day. his presence is a big change for us policies., q: is usa concessions and also australia's willingness to help nuclear supply to india is deliberate as there are reports that world is moving out of nuclear energy to solar , wind energy which are more sustainable....is it like making india a market to dump nuclear ......., a: varghese k george: that is exaggerated fear. all over the world, new research is on to make nuclear technology cheaper, safer and abundant without compromising security aspects. so i guess, post hydrocarbon energy technology may be primarily nuclear., q: on the one hand, a foreigner (president obama) talks on the lines of how we must stand together in spite of our diverse religion and culture, implying that the hatred that most leaders groomed in religious outfits seem to have must let go of them and work for real progress of the country. while on the other hand, we seem to make an issue out of everything (the case of vp ansari criticised in spite of following the protocol). does the future hold any kind of ray of hope to see a 'secular' state?, a: amit baruah: there are disturbing signs on the horizon. it is for the government and its functionaries to take note of these and address them. india can only advance if all its citizens progress together and the country is at peace with itself and its many diversities., q: could india hope from us that it will stand firmly against the terrorism spread by the pakistan ? will they have a stand to fight against terrorism in india, a: amit baruah: the us has its own problems with pakistan. those two countries know each other well! they have been both partners and allies for long. and, now, the public mood in pakistan is distinctly anti-america., q: some us presidents hold meetings with visiting heads of states not in washington but in other places . why not goi also take visting heads to places like ooty , mount abu , shimla etc, a: varghese k george: well namo did try that with xi jinping. that is part of his declared changes that he wants to bring about in diplomacy, q: undoubtedly commerce , security and energy will be to be the top issues in the indo-us dialogue for many years to come. now that obama has yielded some ground on the nuclear deal front will the modi government promote fdi in retail in all the indian states in the context of make in india campaign ?, a: narayan lakshman: a couple of points here: first, it is not clear that the us has yielded any ground on the nuclear deal. see my story in >today's paper. second, i do not think fdi in retail will take a major hit owing to the make in india campaign, primarily because the former will also create lots of jobs in india, even if some profits get repatriated abroad. additionally the focus of the make in india campaign involves other areas, such as defence, the digital india plan and many more, so no reason why fdi retail will be impacted adversely., q: a statement remainding the fundamentalism and religious freedom is really needed to be given by a powerful leader like obama is very much the need of the hour. in our country many people of minorities are being persecuted every now and then....., a: suhasini haidar: i am not sure if president obama making those comments will have much effect in india. if he has issues on religious freedoms, he must bring them up in his bilateral talks, not a speech as he is leaving. it left a rather mixed signal from his visit., q: will obama's visit impact india's relations with russia , given that india has spoken against the russia-ukraine issue and do you foresee russia-china engagement?, a: amit baruah: i think india's closeness to the us is not new, but the russians like others will be marking the presence of obama at republic day, q: as china rightly pointed out, we shouldn’t believe in us. as they propagate false agenda for their own benefits. what does our government think?, a: varghese k george: oh well, we cannot trust china either. that is precisely the logic of ""strategic autonomy"" in india's foreign policy. while we maintain cordial relations with all, don't be drawn into blocs and power rivalries. we are yet to see if that changed under the modi government., q: how do you think china india relations will play out in next 4-5 years? india-us bhai-bhai and china-india, a: suhasini haidar: i think pm modi has taken a very definitive stand on countering china over the past few months in relns with japan, australia, vietnam and the us. this is going to make our engagement with china, which is india's largest trading partner tricky. eam sushma swaraj is heading to beijing next week, pm modi will probably go later this year, so hopefully this will be managed., q: do you think obama visit had compelling motives like selling us goods here and get some support for china ? is yes .. are there any other major motive besides these two ?, a: amit baruah: i think the us is majorly interested in the prospects offered by the indian economy. and, yes, china is on his mind...., , here are the top 10 highlights of obama's india visit, 1. as a departure from protocol, pm modi went to the airport himself to receive and welcome the u.s. president., 2. mr. obama was given a 21-gun salute and a ceremonial welcome at the forecourt of rashtrapati bhavan. he inspected the tri-service guard of honour, which for the first time was led by a woman officer, wing commander pooja thakur., 3. michelle obama, first lady of the united states, descended from air force one clad in a printed floral dress and coat by india-born designer bibhu mohapatra., 4. india and the u.s. achieve a breakthrough on operationalisation of the civil nuclear deal., 5. in his speech at the townhall, the president said, ""every indian should celebrate the success of shah rukh khan, mary kom, milkha singh equally."", 6. president barack obama is the first u.s. president to visit india twice during office, and is also the first u.s. president to be the chief guest at the republic day., 7. hours before his visit to india, mr. obama cancelled the agra leg of his india visit and decided to travel to saudi arabia to meet the new king., 8. we have renewed our defence framework agreement. we will deepen our cooperation on maritime security, said mr. modi during his statement after the bilateral talks., 9. mr. obama announced a slew of initiatives that included $4 billion in loans from u.s. banks, $2 billion in financing for renewable energy projects in india and $1 billion from the exim bank of the u.s. for project financing.",0.15093263106203628,chat - happened : obama ' india visit,"varghese george ( national political affairs editor ) ; amit

2015-02-04,banking on fdi,"recognizing the well-known fact that in terms of industrial growth india has fallen behind many of its former peers such as brazil and south korea, the nda government has made the revival of manufacturing the centre piece of its economic strategy. however, the policy to be adopted to realise this objective has been reduced to the “make in india” slogan, often preceded by the word “come”, suggesting that the intention is to attract foreign investors to invest in manufacturing in this country to produce for export to markets abroad. the government’s role, if successful, would be to fashion the policy environment and ensure the infrastructural conditions needed to facilitate such investment., this strategy is by no means novel, having been experimented with by many a developing country in the past four decades. other than a few, most such experiments have failed. and making this bet at a time when the world economy is still battling with recession may not be all to wise. what is more, given india’s large domestic market, even when foreign investors come to india they are likely to make for the domestic rather than the export market., consider for example india’s own past experience. the reserve bank of india (rbi) has recently released a bunch of numbers on the foreign assets and liabilities of companies registered in india and the finances of foreign direct investment companies (fdics) operating in india. (fdics are firms in which a single foreign investor has at least 10 per cent of equity, which (arbitrarily) is taken as indicative of substantial and long-term interest.), since 2011 the reserve bank of india requires all companies that have received foreign direct investment and/or themselves made investments abroad to file returns on their foreign liabilities and assets. this information collated and released by the rbi point to significant domination by foreign firms in the foreign invested sector. thus the share of fdi in equity (at market value) of companies with foreign ownership of equity stands at 63.9 per cent in the case of financial companies, and a larger 74.5 per cent in the case of non-financial companies (chart 1)., further, the market value of the stock of foreign direct investment equity at the end of march 2013 amounted to 59.4 per cent of the total value of invested capital minus outstanding loans in the registered manufacturing sector. this overwhelming presence, no doubt, partly reflects the unwarranted asset price inflation in india’s stock markets. but, it must be remembered that foreign investors not only own equity of this value. as a result of holding that equity as the largest or the majority shareholders in various enterprises, they have management control of all assets in those enterprises., thus, as the indian government stretches itself to attract more foreign firms to come make in india and convert the country into another manufacturing hub for the world, it may be useful to assess some features of the experience with these firms that are already making in india. there are clearly two sectors into which foreign capital dominantly flows: manufacturing (which accounts for close to 50 per cent of fdi equity valued at market prices; and services (especially financial and business services) which accounts for another 40 per cent (chart 2). so firms do clearly come into the sectors in which the government sees india as having an advantage because of a low wage, skilled and partly english-speaking workforce.",0.06762672811059907,banking fdi,"recognizing well-known fact terms industrial growth india fallen behind many former peers brazil south korea , nda government made revival manufacturing centre piece economic strategy. however , policy adopted realise objective reduced “make india ” slogan , often preceded word “come ” , suggesting intention attract foreign investors invest manufacturing country produce export markets abroad. government ’ role , successful , would fashion policy environment ensure infrastructural conditions needed facilitate investment. , strategy means novel , experimented many developing country past four decades. , experiments failed. making bet time world economy still battling recession may wise. , given india ’ large domestic market , even foreign investors come india likely make domestic rather export market. , consider example india ’ past experience. reserve bank india ( rbi ) recently released bunch numbers foreign assets liabilities companies registered india finances foreign direct investment companies ( fdics ) operating india.

2015-02-14,a budget to transform,"over the past eight months, the government has issued some strong statements on the economy and taken some bold steps aimed at transforming it. as it prepares to present its first real budget we may reflect upon the direction that it should take., first, we would expect a budget with a focus, one that resists the temptation to spread either allocations or interventions too thin. if quickening growth is the objective, and the government has stated that it is, the budget should address this objective squarely by increasing the allocation for capital formation., we know that the trajectory of the economy over the past decade is related to the path of public capital formation, notably in infrastructure. to be effective in the context of a significant slowing of growth, however, a substantial hike in public investment would be necessary. this will come up against the programme of fiscal consolidation being pursued. i do not consider it vital to stick to the 4.1 per cent fiscal-deficit target announced for this year. reports are that this target may have been breached already. but there is a more substantial argument., in the present state of the economy — when there is excess capacity in manufacturing, adequate stocks of foodgrain and the inflation rate is trending downwards — we have an opportune moment for a public investment-centred fiscal expansion. tax revenues will rise following the resulting expansion in output and the increased debt incurred to fund the expansion is thereby financed. this dividend has been termed, cheekily but surely, a “fiscal free lunch”. it also suggests that when there is a feed-forward impulse present in the economy, i.e., its current state casts a shadow on its future, fiscal abstinence when the economy is sluggish could actually lead to a worsened fiscal balance in terms of the debt-gdp ratio, for growth would have been lower. nothing said here detracts from sticking to fiscal consolidation as a desirable long-term objective. it only suggests that its pace must not be forced, but instead calibrated to the state of the economy. right now a rigid adherence to a targeted fiscal deficit is not optimal. to borrow from keynes, “the boom ... is the right time for austerity”. however, the fear is that the government may currently be practising the reverse of this maxim. there are reports that faced with the prospect of overshooting the target of 4.1 per cent for the fiscal deficit in the current fiscal year, the ministry of finance has advised a reduction of plan expenditure. to do so would be foolhardy. note that what is being called for is only a temporary deviation from the target for the fiscal deficit. any fiscal expansion may be reversed as its beneficial effects occur and the economy expands. however, this may take up to three years or so given that growth has slowed for about twice as long., ‘make in india’the argument thus far is based on considerations of aggregate demand deficiency. but there are also significant supply-side gains to be had from public capital formation. these supply-side gains feed into one of the government’s major initiatives and also one that is lacking even as it is very important for the country. the first is the idea of ‘make in india’. the second is agriculture, which has so far received less attention from the government than it deserves given its importance., there is a perception that the ‘make in india’ initiative is pitched towards foreign firms. foreign direct investment (fdi) is important both as a source of funds, foreign exchange and technology, and conditions must be created for a favourable entry of foreign firms, but we can hardly ignore india’s entrepreneurs if we are interested in the wide-spreading of prosperity. and, while indian firms rightly expect a predictable tax regime and freedom from inspector raj, they are also hobbled by the lack of adequate infrastructure. this only the government can provide, though not the central government alone. there is a major role for the state governments in this regard. so long as we are interested not only in economic growth but also in the participation in it by individuals, publicly-provided infrastructure is what is going to make the difference. while special economic zones (sez) can be useful, especially for raising exports, and large corporates may push for them, i have in mind the infrastructure needed to service the segment of indian manufacturing dubbed “unorganised”. more recently termed the msme — micro, small and medium enterprises — sector, this sector produces close to half the manufacturing output, comprises the largest number of production units, employs the largest number of workers, and generates a significant share of exports. what its firms need most is producer services. these range from electricity to waste disposal and assured water supply. these smaller producers do not have the wherewithal to supply these services themselves. on the other hand they would be willing to pay for them., agriculture and rural indiafor ‘make in india’ to progress beyond promise, more than mere legislation is required. an attractive investment climate is made up not only by favourable laws but also by enabling producer services. among these are also information and advice. there is a strong case for something akin to the agricultural extension service for the msme sector. it could be housed in the district industries centres, which were instituted nearly 40 years ago but have remained dormant., a sector of the economy that has not so far received even token attention from the government is agriculture and rural india in general, though technically speaking ‘make in india’, can be said to include rural industry. it is not sufficiently well known that in the past decade the real price of food has risen by 25 per cent. this is completely out of line with the experience of the richer economies of the world where the price of food has shown a secular decline. take china, where the share of food in the household budget is on average much lower than it is in india. as less need be spent on it now, cheaper food expands the demand for manufactures. the general approach in india has been to increase the production of food, but the point actually is to also lower its cost of production. public capital formation in agriculture has been on the downward trend for about 25 years now, preventing the yield increase necessary for keeping price increase in check. the trend needs to be reversed. whether in industry or in agriculture, expansion of the economy’s infrastructural base increases productivity, driving growth and enhancing the tax revenue needed to finance the public debt. but more so, infrastructure empowers people more than consumption subsidies do., having made a case for greater public capital formation, the issue of which projects to undertake is a real one. there is no question that the choice of projects should be done carefully and the implementation rigorous. the pradhan mantri gram sadak yojana initiated some years ago would be an ideal vehicle for investment. after all, roads are needed across the country, rural india would be targeted and the overall outlay will be substantial. only, given india’s diverse geographies a flexible approach should be adopted and the states taken on board. nothing is gained by insisting on one-size-fits-all solutions, a feature that has plagued central schemes

2015-02-17,a social role for niti aayog,"niti aayog has had its first meeting with the economic experts. this was crucial since the government is trying to revive economic growth. the economy has experienced slow growth in spite of the revised national income data that has indicated faster growth. industry, exports and so on, have shown tepid growth in recent years. the national democratic alliance’s electoral promise of an economic turnaround seems elusive in spite of its accelerating “reforms” by liberalising foreign direct investment (fdi) flows and land acquisition policies to signal its pro-corporate sector and big business inclinations., contradictory views, the budget is first a macroeconomic exercise and then a micro one catering to sectors of the economy. two contradictory macroeconomic views are emerging from the government and its policy advisers. this is similar to the policy dilemma that the united progressive alliance faced earlier. the first view is to have a larger fiscal deficit so as to boost demand. the other view is to cut the fiscal deficit to keep the credit rating agencies (proxy for financial interests) happy so as to prevent a downgrade of the economy., the finance minister favours the latter view and argues that a fiscal deficit imposes a burden on future generations who will have to repay the debt. this conservative view assumes that resources are constrained, so if the government spends more, the private sector has less to spend. but that cannot be true when the economy has spare capacity and can produce more. increased government expenditures then boost the economy and lead to more investments via the accelerator. if increased spending is financed by increased direct taxation, that is even better. this is feasible in india since direct taxes are around 7 per cent of gdp which is low when compared to most other countries. but a government trying to signal its pro-business inclination would not wish to raise direct taxes like income, corporation and wealth taxes., “for india, which remains very poor and very unequal, policies based on the interest of finance capital and a narrow section of society can only spell disaster.”, actually, tax rates need not be raised but only the concessions given in taxes (these are called tax expenditures and amount to 4.5 per cent of gdp) need to be curtailed to get more resources. but this may also be seen as anti-business. the other possibility is to tap the black economy (more than 50 per cent of gdp, according to me.) this requires political will which is not yet visible. the business community, the largest generator of black incomes, would see this also as anti business — it has been opposing introduction of general anti avoidance rules (gaar). even if the economy grows faster due to the reduction of the size of the black economy and businessmen gain, they fear it since a bird in the hand is worth two in the bush., the niti aayog meeting does not seem to have considered these deeper issues. advice was sought from former bureaucrats, journalists, industry lobbyists and academics. media reports suggest a lack of coherence in the discussion or in the advice given. some of the invitees had been present in the finance ministry pre-budget meeting last month. so, what was the point of the meeting now when it did not lead to clarity on long-term issues? further, the time for incorporation of policies in the budget is over since most of it would have been formulated by now. it may have been better to circulate for comments a discussion paper on the indian economy’s slowdown and its global interlinkages., dilemma with global echoes, india’s current economic dilemma has global roots. the eurozone, japan and russia are in trouble, the chinese economy has slowed down and the u.s. economy is the only big one that has improved. in such a scenario, increasing exports in a big way would be difficult. declining commodity prices (like that of petroleum goods) signal a weakening global economy. uncertainty is deepened by the arc of instability due to failing states, from afghanistan, syria, iraq, libya, nigeria to east africa. the war in ukraine and the rise of is are compounding the problem., greece threatens the economic stability of the eurozone. the new government there is defying the dictates from the world of finance and has promised to end the austerity regime hoisted on the people of greece. the greek prime minister is telling the european powers that the economic rules of integration of the weaker economies of europe into the eurozone need change. he is arguing that a substantial portion of the debt resulting from the earlier wrong policies needs to be written off. the other troubled economies of europe — portugal, spain and italy — are under increasing political pressure to follow greece’s example., u.s. president barack obama has proposed increasing taxation of the rich while giving more to the middle classes to reverse the growing inequity there. this move not only has a political strategy underlying it but also economic reasons that favour it. given the republican domination in the legislature and their conservative inclinations, it is unlikely that this proposal would be accepted any time soon. but, other countries would be forced to think about the idea, especially in the context of the developments in greece., in 2011, mr. warren buffett gave a call to tax the rich more not only for the sake of equity but also to tackle the global economic crisis. this call was picked up in europe with 16 of the wealthiest french urging their government to tax them more. fifty wealthy germans backed this petition. in italy, the chief of ferrari also lent support., inequity has grown in most countries since the mid-1970s following the domination of global financial capital over policies — spearheaded by the world bank and the international monetary fund (imf). these policies have not only marginalised other sectors of the economy but also promoted bubble economies that are prone to periodic collapse as it happened beginning 2007 and from which the world economy has yet to fully recover., these policies promoted shadow banking and all manner of opaque financial instruments that created economic instability. a casino economy emerged with speculation leading to a fictitious boost in paper wealth, promoting a false sense of well-being among individuals and increased consumption by them. as inequality increased dramatically, and there was the marginalisation of the vast majority, there followed the “occupy wall street movement”, termed as the “99% v the 1%” and which also popularised the term, “main street versus wall street”., for people policies, events in greece and mr. obama’s suggestion suggest that the time has come to end the domination of finance capital over the rest of society. policy space has to be recaptured from the world of finance by the democratic forces so that policies favouring the people can be initiated.",0.06879106379106377,social role niti aayog,"niti aayog first meeting economic experts. crucial since government trying revive

2015-02-20,bengal in the time of bjp,"disadvantaged: “within the trinamool, many believe that if mamata banerjee had embraced neo-liberal economic policies, the saradha scam probe would have been called off a long time ago.” picture shows her in kolkata during a rally to protest state minister madan mitra’s arrest in the saradha scam. photo: sushanta patronobish | photo credit: sushanta patronobish , west bengal’s ruling trinamool congress has been subjected to unusual levels of pressure in the multi-crore saradha chit fund scheme scam. the party argues that the pressure is being mounted on it by the bharatiya janata party (bjp) to ensure a split ahead of next year’s assembly election. while the argument is debatable, it is difficult to understand why political heads are not rolling in states that have witnessed much bigger financial scams in northern india. although political leaders allegedly benefited from the rs.49,000 crore pearl agrotech scam in punjab, a major ponzi scheme, unlike in west bengal, no politician was detained there., within the trinamool many believe that if their chairperson had embraced neo-liberal economic policies, the saradha scam probe would have been called off a long time ago. financial scams are often blown out of proportion — not necessarily to punish tainted leaders, but to rock a party’s boat for electoral gain. many of the trinamool leaders also believe that some token resistance to central ordinances and clever support to the modi government’s neo-liberal policies in parliament could have kept financial scams out of the state., explaining the current situation, trinamool chairperson and west bengal chief minister mamata banerjee says, “if i protect those whose interests are already protected i will be worshipped. but i’m pro-poor.” her “pro-poor” strategy decimated the communist party of india (marxist), which had ruled the state for 34 years, but annoyed “big capital.” soon after ms banerjee’s 2011 electoral victory, former u.s. secretary of state hillary clinton visited west bengal and said the u.s. “desires to open” multi-brand retail market in india. ms banerjee ignored the message. more recently, prior to u.s. president barack obama’s visit, a senior u.s.-india policy studies expert richard rossow said that “a lot of negatives than positives” are being heard about bengal due to ms banerjee’s opposition to neo-liberal policies, including opposition to fdi in retail., compulsionsfor ms banerjee, it is her electorate and not her ideology which prevents her from placing wal-mart’s interest over that of neighbourhood ‘mom-and-pop’ stores, as nearly one-tenth of the state’s population survives by running grocery shops. west bengal’s population is another factor. the state is less than half the size of industrially developed gujarat, with 30 million more people added to its population. it has the second highest population density and a policy of distributing land, which has created multiple stakeholders. so, ms banerjee is “pro-poor” by default, with no leeway to provide market access to “big capital.”, confusionbut her bigger worry is neither “big capital” nor the poor peasant, but a political party that has devoured her energy over the last two decades: the cpi(m)., “the chief minister will need to plug the drain of funds and rise in collective arrogance in trinamool if she wants to continue to hold power in the state”, for the most part of her political career, ms banerjee has invested her efforts in reducing the political hold of the cpi(m) over the state. however, ironically, only three years after assuming power, she is trying to prop up the communists in order to block the rise of the bjp in the state. in bengal politics, it can now be conclusively established that the right is fast eating into the left’s base, creating nightmares for the trinamool. she is worried about the erosion of the cpi(m) voter base, and the bjp gaining from it, as was recently evident in the bongaon by-election where traditional cpi(m) votes went to the bjp., many reasons have been cited to explain the bjp’s expansion, of which the most credible one was elucidated by majid master of north 24 paraganas and his men. mr. master is no average leader of the cpi(m). he controlled the lucrative business of auctioning fish ponds in vested land in parts of the district, generating huge funds for his party. trinamool threatened and pushed him and his comrades out of their fiefdom and took over the business. many of mr. master’s comrades, who conducted election campaigns for the left for decades, eventually joined the bjp in order to survive., after many years, mr. master is back in his village and his pupils are planning to regroup under him, creating an ideal catch-22 situation for the trinamool — if cpi(m) cadres are beaten up, they join the bjp, and if they don’t, they regroup under their leaders, creating a bigger crisis for the trinamool. this is the key concern for ms. banerjee ., the other headache for her is corruption, which is targeting even party workers. sougat ali, a trinamool worker in chhota jagulia panchayat of north 24 paraganas district, was asked to cough up rs.30,000 by the party’s local satraps. ali had to sell the lands he possessed in order to survive. such examples illustrate how the party is now in the business of extortion. and interestingly, trinamool cadres are blackmailing their own party coworkers and forcing them to contribute money., moreover, trinamool has shunted out its whistleblowers. the president of the west bengal board of secondary education chaitali dutta, a prominent activist in ms banerjee’s anti-land acquisition movement, lost her job for questioning the supply racket of school text books, soon after trinamool came to power., in a recent discussion in kolkata’s muslim institute, many urdu-speaking scholars questioned the chief minister’s policy to woo the minorities. “why subsidise muezzins prayer callers when no one asked for it?” or “why did she repeat ‘insha’allah’ in between bengali words while covering her head?” while about 10 per cent of bengal’s muslims speak urdu and their views can be arguably ignored, the opinions of bengali muslims are hardly any different., ms banerjee conspicuously aligned herself with the minorities after the 2011 victory, prompting a quick consolidation of majority votes, resulting in the bjp’s growth. eventually, the trinamool lost the assembly by-election in basirhat-south, with substantial minority votes, in september. ms

2015-02-26,in search of quality fiscal adjustment,"inefficiency: “if fertilizers weren’t subsidised, farmers would use less of it and perhaps adopt better farming techniques.” picture shows a farmer in khammam district of telangana. photo: g.n. rao | photo credit: - g_n_rao , ever since reserve bank of india governor raghuram rajan talked about it, “high-quality fiscal adjustment” has become the buzzword for expectations surrounding the contents of this year’s budget. one can’t argue against high-quality fiscal adjustment. it’s like motherhood and apple pie. but it isn’t clear what it means. we know it doesn’t mean meeting the deficit target by squeezing expenditures in the last quarter of the fiscal year; running arrears with oil and fertilizer companies; or getting public sector companies to cough up additional year-end dividends. in the last few years, this has been the sad tale of fiscal consolidation. this year, too, the deficit target will likely be met by using some or all of the above tactics despite a massive respite from the oil price collapse, large ad hoc increases in excise tax on petroleum products, and an all-time-high equity market., but all this is in the past. more relevant for next year’s budget is what the government makes of the need to make quality fiscal adjustments. if one goes by the exhortations of corporate leaders and analysts, it is essentially increasing capital and lowering social spending (subsidies) as much as possible. prima facie, the argument sounds fine. capital (infrastructure) spending is good because it delivers higher and better-quality economic growth. if doing so requires running a higher deficit, it is still not a bad thing because the added expenditure goes into creating productive capacity, rather than being wasted in higher consumption., but there are a couple of problems with this argument. first, it is very hard to find any convincing evidence, either in india or elsewhere, that an injection of public investment increases medium-term growth. the only discernible effect is that it raises growth in the year the spending occurs, which is exactly the effect that one would expect if the government increased social spending or raised the wages of civil servants., does this mean that the government shouldn’t undertake infrastructure projects? of course not. for a long time now, india has talked about the need for spending a trillion dollars on building infrastructure. the price tag has probably risen quite a bit with the new government adding ambitious river-linking, renewable energy and smart cities projects. the erstwhile planning commission, based on the pre-2008 global financial world, had divided the implementation between public and private sectors and how much was to be financed by domestic banks, the corporate bond market, fdi, portfolio inflows, and central and state budgets. in turn, getting the implementation and funding going would require structural and regulatory reforms, including changes in environmental laws, land acquisition procedures, corporate bond markets, public sector undertaking (psu) banking operations, fdi and portfolio investment limits., the world has changed dramatically since then, and it is doubtful whether the pre-2008 calculations would work now. so, to get capital spending right, the government needs to revisit these issues, reformulate the medium-term spending and funding plan, and implement the needed structural and regulatory reforms. that’s the right way to recast public infrastructure spending, and not merely as a way to boost near-term growth, especially when there isn’t any compelling reason to do so. if anything, the global headwinds of the last few years have turned into tailwinds for india. growth in the g-3 economies is expected to rise, oil prices are forecasted to remain very low, and global financial conditions are expected to remain easy. under such conditions, it is hard to justify any fiscal boost to growth., the second problem lies with conflating subsidies with social protection. subsidies hide the true cost of resources. this leads to inefficiencies. consider the use of fertilizer: if it weren’t subsidised, farmers would use less of it, instead adopting different and perhaps better farming techniques. so, eliminating subsidies can be a good thing. but the government isn’t planning to do so. instead, it is aiming to reduce the overall subsidy bill by better targeting through direct cash transfers. this is a welcome step, but it doesn’t improve efficiency much. the government needs to eliminate subsidies while simultaneously expanding targeted and demand-driven social and unemployment protection programmes and untied income transfers, not out of the kindness of its heart, but because such programmes are efficient. they provide fiscal policy the ability to respond quickly to growth booms and slowdowns without going through delays caused by the inevitable lags when government machinery has to identify the need to change policy, decide on the best ways of doing so, and then implement them. often, by the time the government manages to implement such discretionary changes, the economic conditions alter dramatically.",0.09296475995914197,search quality fiscal adjustment,"inefficiency : “if fertilizers ’ subsidised , farmers would use less perhaps adopt better farming techniques. ” picture shows farmer khammam district telangana. photo : g.n. rao &#124; photo credit : - g_n_rao , ever since reserve bank india governor raghuram rajan talked , “high-quality fiscal adjustment ” become buzzword expectations surrounding contents year ’ budget. one ’ argue high-quality fiscal adjustment. ’ like motherhood apple pie. ’ clear means. know ’ mean meeting deficit target squeezing expenditures last quarter fiscal year ; running arrears oil fertilizer companies ; getting public sector companies cough additional year-end dividends. last years , sad tale fiscal consolidation. year , , deficit target likely met using tactics despite massive respite oil price collapse , large ad hoc increases excise tax petroleum products , all-time-high equity market. , past. relevant next year ’ budget government makes need make quality fiscal adjustments. one goes exhortations corporate leaders analysts , essentially increasing capital lowering social spending ( subsidies ) much possible. prima facie , argument sounds fine. capital ( infrastructure ) spending good delivers higher better-quality economic growth. requires running higher deficit , still bad thing added expenditure goes creating productive capacity , rather wasted higher consumption. , couple problems argument. first , hard find convincing evidence , either india elsewhere , injection public investment increases medium-term growth. discernible effect raises growth year spending occurs , exactly effect one would expect government increased social spending raised wages civil servants. , mean government ’ undertake infrastructure projects ?

2015-03-02,a framework for recovery and growth,"budget-making today is a tough call for a finance minister trying to reverse the past decline caused by the upa’s policies. the indian economy, for example, decelerated from an 8.4 per cent growth rate in gdp in 2003-04 to 4.8 per cent in 2013-14. the upa’s decade of economic decline has been wrongly attributed to the global economic meltdown especially during the last six years of the decade., therefore, recovery and growth need a different policy today, and require choosing a new framework of objectives, priorities, strategy and resource mobilisation measures in constituting a budget., the budget for 2015-16 presented on saturday to parliament by union finance minister arun jaitley is a serious attempt to usher in such a new framework. an analysis of how far he has succeeded and what more remains to be done for a successful turnaround is the concern here in this article., participatory notesthe indian economy has declined because of the peculiar indian “invention” of that perfidious financial derivative called participatory notes or pns, otherwise known as the crony/crooked facilitator for black money-based portfolio investment. no other country would think of such a derivative., the budget does not treat pns as a time bomb and to seek to abolish this derivative, as the tarapore committee had wanted. actually, pns have been even more legitimised by enhancing their status to that of fdi inflow., “the indian economy has declined because of the peculiar indian ‘invention’ of a perfidious financial derivative called participatory notes.”, the finance minister ought to have abolished pns in this budget to stabilise the economy. i do not know if mr. jaitley was even shown this legitimisation of pns which is in the fine print of the budget documents., he has introduced many new measures, such as a vastly increased agricultural credit facility, the new mudra bank to fund the underfunded, especially scheduled caste/tribe entrepreneurs, tax-free bonds for infrastructure development, ultra-large power plants of 4,000 mw, monetisation of hoarded gold by paying interest on gold deposit accounts in banks and ease of doing business in india by a digitisation of procedures. but this is not enough to kick-start the economy since mr. jaitley has not embedded such piecemeal measures in the larger picture of economic reform and budgetary restructure., looming crisistoday, for example, there is a budgetary crisis looming on the horizon because the allocations for major heads of expenditure — government employees’ salaries, pensions, police, defence, subsidies, interests to be paid for past loans taken by the government, etc., and which now cover 98 per cent of the current and capital account revenues accruing to government — cannot be reduced without creating a political crisis., these allocations are revenue expenditures, and hence not asset-building or investments for development projects., moreover, in the past, in the revenue budget, these expenditures far exceed the revenue. thus, the revenue budget has been in huge deficit, and which is covered by taking more loans from public sector banks and creating a surplus in the capital account by trimming investment allocation., in the budget, we find this is continued because non-plan expenditure has risen 11 per cent while plan expenditure has been stagnant. in a financially healthy economy, it should be the other way around — surplus on the revenue account, i.e., revenue exceeding expenditure, and a deficit in the capital account, i.e., investment exceeding amortisation. , this situation however cannot continue for long because loans from public sector banks to the government to pay for the overall deficit in the budget have to be paid back. it will require a major recapitalisation of banks to meet the basel iii norms or else the public sector banks may go bankrupt by 2017. a time bomb is ticking here., being futuristicthe big picture we have to usher in is an indian economy growing annually at 10 to 12 per cent by inducing the current household saving rate of 29 per cent of income to rise again to the rate of 36 per cent., to become a developed country in the foreseeable future, india’s gdp will have to grow at 10 to 12 per cent per year for at least a decade. a 12 per cent gdp growth rate per year will mean a doubling of gdp every six years, and that of per capita income, doubling every seven years., this level of the growth rate can take us to the league of the top three nations of the world, of the united states, china and india by 2020, and then aim to overtake china in the next decade thereafter. that should be a stated goal of every budget and not just a “balancing the books” exercise., technically, this is within india’s reach, since it would require the rate of investment to rise while productivity growth will have to ensure that the incremental output-capital ratio declines from the present 4.0 to 3.0. productivity increases can be achieved by cutting transaction cost in the ease to do business and by motivating labour with incentives to work harder., further, if we reduce transaction cost by eliminating corruption, then the current incremental capital-output ratio will easily fall from 4.0 to 3.0., enthusing the middle classthis can also be sustained by directly, and not indirectly, enthusing the middle class — which today can be achieved only by abolishing personal income tax., in this budget, the middle class has little to cheer about. the morning-after announcement of petrol and diesel price hikes even while internationally, crude oil price continues to be in decline, has only further discouraged the middle class. india’s middle class urgently needs some good news., india has many advantages to achieve a booming economy such as a demographic dividend, agriculture that has internationally the lowest yield in land and livestock-based products, and also, by wto reckoning, the lowest cost of production, 12 months a year of farm-friendly weather, a highly competitive, skilled and semi-skilled labour force and low wage rates at the national level, the advantages of which have already been proved to the world by the outsourcing phenomenon. we have a young population — the average is 28 years when compared to the u.s.’s 38 years, and japan’s 49 years — that is the base for it to usher in innovation in our production process., since the worldview of economic development has now completely changed, economic development is no more thought of as being capital-driven, but knowledge-driven. for application of knowledge, we need innovations, which means more original research, and more fresh, young minds out of the cream of youth to be inculcated with learning and to be at the frontier of research.",0.05416562532541914,framework recovery growth,"budget-making today tough call finance minister trying

2015-03-03,private sector in defence resurgence,"when i once met prime minister narendra modi, i was struck by a telling comment he made during our conversation. he said, “anil, do you know that even the tears we shed in this country are not our own? every tear gas shell used by our security agencies is actually imported!”, the prime minister’s anguish was entirely genuine and for me, an eye-opener, literally., it left me in no doubt about the prime minister’s ‘make in india’ initiative and what a remarkable change of mindset it represented when compared to earlier governments, particularly in relation to the defence sector. for me, it was an extraordinary and personal glimpse into the prime minister’s thinking, his larger strategic vision, and his determination to make india a leading global player in defence manufacturing. this was reinforced by his choice of defence minister, manohar parrikar., “ for far too long, indecisiveness in defence procurements, based on a play safe approach, has resulted in the armed forces suffering with suboptimal hardware. this is truly a travesty.””, mr. parrikar is among the most talented, intelligent, hardworking and ethical leaders india has seen. his brief, from what i have seen so far, is to push the ‘make in india’ agenda, and provide our armed forces with the best possible, cutting-edge equipment and armaments. his reputation for being a man of principle and probity and one who is ready to change existing norms and systems for greater efficiency and transparency — are the two elements that will transform our defence sector into one that is modern and world class., troubled neighbourhood we live in a troubled neighbourhood and defending our borders has become a huge challenge. there are frequent exchanges of fire with pakistani troops along the line of control (loc), infiltration attempts, and frequent face-offs with china on the line of actual control (lac). growing military and political relations between china and pakistan continue to define our strategic vision to counter this joint threat. one of the most illustrative examples of how our defence preparedness has suffered is the fact that for 25 years, the indian army has not been able to replace the bofors 155 howitzer gun, a vital force multiplier in our artillery arsenal. this was because no indian firm made similar weapons. thus, the new policy of opening up the defence sector to private players will go a long way in ending such self-imposed handicaps imposed on our defence forces., therefore, defence preparedness holds the key to our future as a nation. i recently had the honour of meeting each of our three service chiefs — gen. dalbir singh suhag, air chief marshal arup raha and admiral robin dhowan; three officers of exceptional integrity, dedication and commitment. i came away reassured that the defence of our realm is in very capable hands. our greatest blessing is that we have the finest officers and bravest men and women in uniform anywhere in the world., importance of quality, unfortunately, borders in today’s world cannot be defended by strength of character nor wars won by dedication, training, discipline and bravery alone. without technological superiority, our country remains vulnerable, entailing disproportionate levels of sacrifice on the part of our valiant armed forces. the kargil war exemplified this harsh reality. for far too long, indecisiveness in defence procurements, based on a play safe approach, has resulted in the armed forces suffering with suboptimal hardware. this is truly a travesty., the outcome of war is never certain. however, success in warfare in our age is greatly aided by technological superiority, information systems and the quality and precision of weaponry. we owe it to our men and women in uniform to give them the best-of-class military hardware., most submarines currently operated by the indian navy are past their operational life, while the indian air force is still saddled with mig-21 aircraft of 1970s vintage. india has great power ambitions, and with justification. we are seeking a permanent seat in the un security council and india is projected to be the world’s third largest economy by 2024. yet, unlike all other major powers in the world, india remains the largest importer of defence hardware in the world. nearly three-quarters of all our critical defence equipment is sourced from abroad., our record in developing our aerospace industry, quite unlike the remarkable strides we have made in other high-technology areas such as space, communications and missile programmes, is a sorry one, hobbled by missed opportunities, short-term thinking, a lack of controls on domestic manufacturers, and a blinkered strategic vision., recent industry surveys assess the maturity of india’s aerospace on a scale of 5 at 2.7, the lowest among all defence sectors, lagging far behind naval and land systems., studies also peg india’s defence hardware purchases at over $250 billion or nearly rs.16 lakh crore. sadly, based on our current record, nearly most of this equipment will have to be imported., our goal of minimum dependence in aerospace is nowhere in sight. it is clear that if we wish to peg our defence expenditure at the current or even higher levels of gdp, then we will have to manufacture a major proportion of our requirements indigenously and, in time, begin to export so as to rollback the net deficit in the defence sector., engaging the private sector so, what’s the way forward? the prime minister has outlined a bold new vision for india’s defence resurgence. underlying the many policy changes that his government has announced — starting with the raise in the foreign direct investment (fdi) cap in defence from 26 to 49 per cent and, with cabinet approval, even to 100 per cent in identified areas of critical technologies — is the recognition that what we need most of all is a total change of mindset and approach to boosting this vital sector. i have listed some urgent points that need to be addressed to make this change work for india., there is need to acknowledge at every level of government that the private sector in india can be trusted to play as important a role in the modernisation of india’s defence capabilities as the public sector., we need a common framework for defence procurement across research establishments, ordnance factories, defence public sector units (psu) and the private sector. decision making needs to be simpler, faster and transparent., there’s an urgent need to address and improve the ease-of-doing-business. the ministry of defence is the sole customer for the defence industry in the country. without long-term contracts, certainty of volumes, a quick selection process, transparency and fair payment terms, there will be little incentive for private players to invest the huge resources required for defence production., there is a compelling case for creating a single window for defence licensing and fdi approvals. for example, the department of industrial policy and promotion (dipp) and the foreign investment promotion board (fipb), which are currently under different departments/ministries, ought to be brought under one umbrella., any large-scale involvement of the private sector in defence would require a clear road map for engagement, with clearly identified thrust areas. we need to think of new modalities of public-private partnership (ppp). one answer is a joint working group, comprising leading representatives of the private sector and key decision makers in the government, who will work together from the planning stage so that private companies have a clear idea of the areas in which they need to invest. this will help the development of human skill sets and capital infrastructure., we need to set up a sovereign defence fund, on a ppp model, in which the government holds 49 per cent while private defence sector players make up the balance, with no player contributing more than 5 per cent of the total. professionally managed, such a fund can help invest in long-gestation research and development projects and facilitate strategic global acquisitions in key technology areas of defence and national security. this will also be a big support for the micro, small and medium enterprises (msmes), which form a critical part of any developed defence industrial base., we need to accord infrastructure industry status to the defence sector, thereby paving the way for easier credit and a greater role and opportunity for the private sector., for policy shift the long shadow of the 3cs — the cbi, the cvc and the cag — have hamstrung decision-making in india’s defence sector with the fear of regulatory censure and investigative overreach. we need to move forward with courage and conviction and have necessary safeguards to protect the decision makers just as in the coal block allocation sector where the bureaucracy has been provided protection. the new model for india’s defence sector should be built on a cornerstone of the new 3cs, namely cooperation, competition, and collaboration., there are also some obvious truths to be considered. modern governments need to function with the need for discretion in policy formulation and implementation in a sector as sensitive as defence. however, the modernisation of india’s armed forces cannot be held hostage to indecisiveness or vacillation. it is no secret that procedural delays and departmental red tape have often caused a greater loss to the exchequer in defence procurement than any alleged improprieties., the road ahead is long. but with the current leadership, i believe we have our best chance of success in evolving a world class defence manufacturing sector. with commitment, cooperation and a clear vision, we can turn the prime minister’s ‘make in india’ slogan into a reality. it offers us the best chance to repay the brave men and women of our armed forces for their dedication, discipline, and sacrifice.",0.12545156232656232,private sector defence resurgence,"met prime minister narendra modi ,

2015-03-12,"radical in promise, not in practice","the defence budget for the next fiscal year conforms to the overall pattern of the >budget presented by the finance minister. it is radical in promise but incremental in practice. there was a modest raise in defence allocation of just about 11 per cent. then again, the proportion of capital expenditure in the defence budget has shrunk a bit. we may well wonder how the armed forces will shop for their long wishlist that includes howitzers and helicopters, fighter aircraft and attack submarines. mr. arun jaitley’s claim that he has provided “adequately” for the needs of the military surely turns on a generous interpretation of the operative word., more important, however, was his assurance that the government’s “>make in india” policy would help achieve greater self-sufficiency in defence equipment, including aircraft. this was entirely in keeping with the prime minister’s remarks at the ‘aero india’ show in bengaluru a few days earlier. speaking on that occasion, mr. narendra modi emphasised that the >defence industry was “at the heart” of the “make in india” programme. by increasing the share of domestic procurement of military equipment from 40 per cent to 70 per cent in five years, he added, india could double the output of its defence industry. more significantly, he noted that the indian private sector would have to play a much larger role in this transformation of our defence industrial base., the case of hal the prime minister’s call was at once apt and ironic. bengaluru is, of course, the home of hindustan aeronautics limited (hal) — the largest defence public sector undertaking (psu). few recall, though, that the hal has its origins in private enterprise. it began during the second world war as the brainchild of walchand hirachand, a leading businessman and nationalist sympathiser. walchand controlled the scindia steam navigation company and had long dreamt of reviving shipbuilding in india — an industry that had been monopolised by british firms. his attempt to build a shipyard in visakhapatnam proved abortive; as did his plan to set up an automobile factory to cater for the war effort. walchand’s most ambitious undertaking was to manufacture aircraft in india., soon after the war began in september 1939, walchand entered into discussions with an american aircraft conglomerate and offered to build military aircraft for the indian government according to specifications. new delhi’s response was shot through with scepticism. only a year later, when imports were no longer reliable, did the indian government take up walchand’s offer. then too, the government’s unwillingness to support the venture led walchand to turn to the princely state of mysore, which agreed to provide land near bengaluru as well as concessionary loans. on december 23, 1940, the hindustan aircraft company came into existence. the government placed orders for 74 long-range bombers, 48 fighter planes and 30 trainers. by the end of august 1941, the first trainer was handed over to the military. other aircraft too began to be turned out on schedule. in early 1942, following japan’s entry into the war, the indian government decided to take direct control of the company. much against his wishes, walchand was arm-twisted into divesting his stake. the plant was handed over to the u.s. army air forces, which used it as a repair and overhaul facility for the remainder of the war. thereafter, it reverted to the control of the indian government., long road ahead the hal has now come to symbolise the stranglehold that the psus have on our defence industrial base. the prime minister’s decision to give a fillip to the private sector is laudable and overdue. some initial moves have already been made. the cap on foreign direct investment (fdi) in defence has been raised from 26 per cent to 49 per cent. investment from foreign institutional investors (fiis) has been allowed up to 24 per cent. it is no longer mandatory to have a single indian investor with at least 51 per cent stake. industrial licences have been dispensed with for some items. yet, much more needs to be done if our domestic production and private sector participation are to approach anything close to the levels envisaged by the government., “to create a ‘level playing field’, the government will have to provide other incentives for the private sector to participate in other sectors of the defence industrial base such as assembles, spare parts and components.”, for a start, the categorisation under the defence procurement procedure needs to be considered afresh. while increasing focus on “make” and “buy & make (indian)” is important, it will not automatically harness private sector participation. in the latter category, for instance, requests for proposal (rfp) have been circulated to foreign manufacturers with the condition that they choose an indian partner. yet, indian companies, including the private sector, that have the requisite capability have not been considered for the rfps apparently owing to their lack of experience in delivery. this begs the question of how the indian private sector is expected to acquire experience in the first instance., a related problem is the use of direct or indirect nomination of defence psus or ordnance factories. this too loads the dice against the private sector. the government should do away with this practice: all contracts should be opened up for bidding. the government should also take on board a suggestion made by the kelkar committee almost 10 years ago. this is to identify certain firms based on their technical, managerial and financial strength as “champions” (“raksha udyog ratna”) and circulate rfps for major systems to these firms., this model has worked well in other countries. in fact, a committee constituted by the government identified 13 indian firms that could be designated along these lines. but eventually the government baulked at the idea of being seen as favouring some private companies over others. this is a misapprehension, for only a few companies will in fact be capable of producing major systems. to create a “level playing field”, the government will have to provide other incentives for the private sector — especially small and medium enterprises — to participate in other segments of the defence industrial base such as assembles, spare parts and components., more broadly, the regulatory regime for private sector participation in defence production needs a host of changes: total elimination of licensing; removal of the differential and regressive tax and duties treatment for indian private industry vis-à-vis the defence psus and foreign manufacturers; easing the availability of capital, land and infrastructure; and ensuring better planning and strict implementation of offsets. these measures (and more) have been underscored by the various committees that have gone into these questions. the government is evidently seized of their importance. it should now work systematically to bring about these changes.",0.027536255411255404,"radical promise , practice","defence budget next fiscal year conforms overall pattern >budget presented finance minister. radical promise incremental practice. modest raise defence allocation 11 per cent. , proportion capital expenditure defence budget shrunk bit. may well wonder armed forces shop long wishlist includes howitzers helicopters , fighter aircraft attack submarines. mr. arun jaitley ’ claim provided “adequately ” needs military surely turns generous interpretation operative word. , important , however , assurance government ’ “>make india ” policy would help achieve greater self-sufficiency defence equipment , including aircraft. entirely keeping prime minister ’ remarks ‘aero india ’ show bengaluru days earlier. speaking occasion , mr. narendra modi emphasised >defence industry “at heart ” “make india ” programme. increasing share domestic procurement military equipment 40 per cent 70 per cent five years , added , india could double output defence industry. significantly , noted indian private sector would play much larger role transformation defence industrial base. , case hal prime minister ’ call apt ironic. bengaluru , course , home hindustan aeronautics limited ( hal ) — largest defence public sector undertaking ( psu ) . recall , though , hal origins private enterprise. began second world war brainchild walchand hirachand , leading businessman nationalist sympathiser. walchand controlled scindia steam navigation company long dreamt reviving shipbuilding india — industry monopolised british firms. attempt build shipyard visakhapatnam proved abortive ;

services exam personal interview. the board tends to ask questions on international issues and trends as part of general studies, current affairs or as academic pursuit of the candidates. whenever the interviewees prefer indian foreign service as a career choice the interview panel is predisposed to ask questions elaborately on global issues and concerns., there are five broad areas of focus here: indian foreign policy, international institutions (wto, uno, imf and world bank), international problems, international regional organisations (saarc, asean, eu, nafta) and the foreign policy of major powers (united states of america, peoples republic of china, russia, etc)., the interview board seeks to identify the candidates’ understanding of the elements, components and objectives of indian foreign policy. the candidates must make a swot analysis of indian foreign policy in the landscape of international diplomacy in the contemporary world, especially if students have indicated indian foreign service as the first service option in the main application form. the interview panel is bound to engage more on the diverse issues, concerns, innovations, strategies and problems of indian foreign policy including look east policy, gujral doctrine of non-reciprocity, pancha sheel principles or five principles of peaceful coexistence, look east and link west policy, fdi (first develop india) and modifications in foreign policy under the new government., india stands at the threshold of a new era of economic growth, military might, science and technology achievements and a largely successful democratic model of governance. students must analyse the major advantages of india, especially the vital components of its expanding soft power resources. past panels have asked the candidates to display the array of arguments that can be advocated to demand a place for india in the permanent membership of the security council of the united nations organization. candidates can concentrate on preparing arguments such as the expanding economy, second largest population, seventh largest geography, function democracy, impressive military capabilities and equally admirable self-restrained military behaviour, constructive and peace-loving diplomacy and steadfast adherence to the basic charter and objectives of united nations organization, greater participation in the numerous peace-keeping operations of uno in many continents and countries so as to bolster india’s case for a permanent membership of the security council., candidates ought to study comprehensively the new concepts in international policies, economics and relations and such a detailed preparation will pay rich dividends in the written tests of the civil services exam, especially in the general studies papers 1 and 2 and general essay of the main test, too. for example, concepts like soft state, overdeveloped state, failed state, isis, orphan states are debated in the realm of international politics. last year, the interview panel asked a candidate probing questions on the over powering presence of the military in the democratic political life of pakistan and in the course of the discursive engagement it asked the candidate a specific factual question as to what is meant by the term “milbus.”, the candidate answered that the term “milbus” is a neologism from the combination of

2015-04-15,"the key is technology, not money","“the prolonged delay over finalising the rafale deal was reportedly over disputes about the role of hindustan aeronautics ltd.” picture shows rafale jet fighters in the dassault factory in merignac near bordeaux, france. | photo credit: regis duvignau , india’s notorious dependence on imported military hardware and the near moribund state of large parts of its public sector defence industry represent a full-blown crisis crying for a solution. india is the world’s largest arms importer and, with at least two decades of not replacing or upgrading obsolescent equipment through either purchases or indigenous manufacture, is on course now to spend around $30 billion in the next few years, and $200 billion in the medium term. for some years now, from the atal bihari vajpayee-led national democratic alliance government in 2001 onwards, the government has been veering towards increased foreign direct investment (fdi) in defence manufacturing as a solution to the defence crisis., the present bharatiya janata party government, despite its rallying ‘make in india’ cry, has further >increased the fdi limit in defence, with 49 per cent now permitted under the automatic route, 75 per cent where technology transfer is involved, and up to 100 per cent in cases involving significant new technology. while some indian companies are wary of the entry of foreign players, most favour opening up the sector with an eye to the potentially lucrative business opportunities they see opening up., for and against fdi the arguments in favour of fdi in defence are familiar. first, public sector companies in defence, research and development and allied industries have consistently failed to meet the requirements of the armed forces, especially given the global revolution in military technology. second, the superior management culture of the private sector will ensure better adherence to budgets and timelines. third, the country is compelled into repeated imports without any technology transfer (despite contractual obligations) because the military is always urgently in need of the technology. therefore, the argument goes, encouraging foreign companies to invest in indian defence and set up industries here will mean that money will be spent within the country, generating jobs and bringing in new know-how, with the possibility of exports., “ all the liberalised provisions since 2001 have led to a meagre inflow of only $4.8 billion, in an overall fdi inflow of around $334 billion.”, the fdi inflow itself tells a tale. all the liberalised provisions since 2001 have led to a meagre inflow of only $4.8 billion, in an overall fdi inflow of around $334 billion. it may be argued that it is too early to judge, but there are actually good reasons why defence companies do not and will not find fdi in another country attractive, and why there are few such examples across the world., fdi means a long-term presence in india, and good returns on investment are possible only if repeat orders or contracts for newer models are assured. but, unlike cars or white goods, that will not always happen in military equipment. there may be gaps of many years or even decades between orders. for instance, india bought the mirage 2000 in the 1980s and has clinched the rafale deal this year, both from dassault of france. in france itself, however, dassault is reasonably assured of continuous business from regular domestic and european orders, as well as from staggered exports. foreign subsidiaries or substantial fdi will, thus, always put pressure on india for repeat orders. would dependence on a lockheed martin (india) or a bharat boeing be really very different from dependence on the u.s. principals?, yes, more of india’s money will be spent in india rather than in other countries. but the defence procurement policy anyway mandates 30 per cent offsets (50 per cent in high-value contracts). in other words, the supplier must spend 30 per cent of the contracted value within india through local manufacture and services. on the other hand, even if manufacture were by an indian subsidiary, some specialised technology or components will always need to be imported. as is the case in car manufacture by korean or japanese subsidiaries in india, where numerous models that sell in smaller volumes are only assembled in india with imported components. fdi may, therefore, not be so different from offsets in terms of local manufacture, jobs, or money spent., where is the technology? it is often simplistically assumed, unfortunately by policymakers too, that fdi will bring in technology. nothing could be farther from the truth. all foreign defence majors have protested continually against offsets, and have pressured india into diluting offset requirements one way or another. while they might cite logistical or other issues, the real anxiety is about sharing and losing control over technology, especially if the offset partner in india is a public company whose bargaining power would be greater than that of a private sector junior partner. the delay over finalising the rafale deal was reportedly over disputes about the role of hindustan aeronautics ltd., “ it is often simplistically assumed, unfortunately by policymakers too, that fdi will bring in technology.”, the present offsets policy is similarly not being used purposefully to acquire technology. offsets are viewed in financial terms — money spent locally and jobs created. instead, offset projects should be studied strategically — indian scientists and companies acquiring the capability to independently develop and manufacture sophisticated military hardware. to rephrase, the goal should be ‘made by india’, not merely ‘make in india’. this is true for all technology, but crucial in defence. india has done it in space and nuclear technology. why not in defence?",0.03943903318903319,"key technology , money","“the prolonged delay finalising rafale deal reportedly disputes role hindustan aeronautics ltd. ” picture shows rafale jet fighters dassault factory merignac near bordeaux , france. &#124; photo credit : regis duvignau , india ’ notorious dependence imported military hardware near moribund state large parts public sector defence industry represent full-blown crisis crying solution. india world ’ largest arms importer , least two decades replacing upgrading obsolescent equipment either purchases indigenous manufacture , course spend around $ 30 billion next years , $ 200 billion medium term. years , atal bihari vajpayee-led national democratic alliance government 2001 onwards , government veering towards increased foreign direct investment ( fdi ) defence manufacturing solution defence crisis. , present bharatiya janata party government , despite rallying ‘make india ’ cry , >increased fdi limit defence , 49 per cent permitted automatic route , 75 per cent technology transfer involved , 100 per cent cases involving significant new technology. indian companies wary entry foreign players , favour opening sector eye potentially lucrative business opportunities see opening up. , fdi arguments favour fdi defence familiar. first , public sector companies defence , research development allied industries consistently failed meet requirements armed forces , especially given global revolution military technology. second , superior management culture private sector ensure better adherence budgets timelines. third , country compelled repeated imports without technology transfer ( despite contractual obligations ) military always urgently need technology. therefore , argument goes , encouraging foreign companies invest indian defence set industries mean money spent within country , generating jobs bringing new know-how , possibility exports. , “ liberalised provisions since 2001 led meagre inflow $ 4.8 billion , overall fdi inflow around $ 334 billion. ” , fdi inflow tells tale. liberalised provisions since 2001 led meagre inflow $ 4.8 billion , overall fdi inflow around $ 334 billion. may argued early judge , actually good reasons defence companies find fdi another country attractive , examples across world. , fdi means long-term presence india , good returns investment possible repeat orders contracts newer models assured. , unlike cars white goods , always happen military equipment. may gaps many years even decades orders. instance , india bought mirage 2000 1980s clinched rafale deal year , dassault france. france , however , dassault reasonably assured continuous business regular domestic european orders , well staggered exports. foreign subsidiaries substantial fdi , thus , always put pressure india repeat orders. would dependence lockheed martin ( india ) bharat boeing really different dependence u.s. principals?

2015-04-29,tracking two growth stories,"dr. arvind virmani | photo credit: v sridhar , the long anticipated deceleration in the rate of the growth of china’s economy is under way. even the normally conservative world bank and the international monetary fund (imf) are confirming that its growth is slowing down and is likely to fall below seven per cent. even those analysts who had forecast a deceleration in its growth were unsure about when exactly the slowdown would start., in the 2000s, i had estimated that china’s growth would decelerate below eight per cent, around the middle of the decade beginning 2010. the global financial crisis of 2008 sharply raised the probability that the slowdown would occur within the following decade despite risky efforts by china to prop up growth., in contrast, india was forecast to achieve its potential growth rate of about eight per cent, given its export-import neutral growth model. the surprise in india’s case was the sharp slowdown from 2011-12, largely attributed to complacency and domestic policy mistakes. however, despite these mistakes, india’s growth rate from 2002-03 to 2013-14 was among the 10 highest in the world (using the old data series). though the correction of these mistakes may no longer be enough to restore growth to earlier levels, india can and must restore growth to the average rates achieved earlier. again, this has been recognised by both the world bank and the imf. these two developments taken together, imply that india’s trend growth rate is poised to exceed that of china’s in the next few decades., closing the gdp gap, this will start the long, slow process of closing the gdp gap with china, which was 1.4 times india's real gdp (in absolutes) in 2013. there is a common tendency to confuse relative levels of gdp with growth rates, so it is important to understand that china’s real gdp measured at purchasing power parity in 2011 international dollars is now 2.4 times that of india., the two economies were almost equal at the end of the 1980s (china was 1.1 times that of india in 1990). during this period, its growth averaged 9.9 per cent per annum, 3.4 per cent points faster than india’s 6.5 per cent average. even if the growth gap was inverted (i.e. became -3.4 per cent), it would take double the time (i.e. 30 years) to close the gdp gap as it took to open it., growth slowdownthe basic theory and empirics of growth show that fast growing economies like japan, south korea, singapore and thailand, which grew fast when they were at low or middle income levels of per capita gdp, maintained growth at high levels for one to two decades and then slowed down as their per capita gdp approached that of the (lower end) high income economies. in the case of china, the surprise was that it maintained an average growth of 10 per cent for 30 years, despite reaching middle income levels of per capita gdp about a decade ago. many analysts who had been proved wrong in the 1990s, in their predictions of a china growth slowdown, became much more cautious. those of us who were willing to take a reputational risk have been proved right, as china’s economy slowed below eight per cent in 2012 and is now predicted to slow below seven per cent by the multilateral institutions., the global financial crisis ensured that the growth of world trade would slow sharply below the very high growth seen in the previous decade, aided by a correction of the bubble-like growth seen prior to the crisis. this meant that china’s (net) export-investment model was no longer sustainable and would produce slower growth in the 2010s. to delay this slowdown, china pumped large amounts of debt into the economy, with the official debt-gdp ratio rising from 55.2 per cent in 2008 to 88.1 per cent in 2013, an average increase of 6.6 per cent points of gdp per annum. analysts have estimated that the debt in the shadow banking system may have increased by an equivalent amount, rising to dangerously risky levels. based on a historical experience of such debt bubbles, some analysts predict that this bubble is likely to burst and reduce china’s growth rate to the three to four per cent levels. analysts, who have greater confidence in the ability of the chinese communist party to manage an economic crisis, nevertheless, predict a deceleration of the trend rate of growth to a range of five to seven per cent., comparing growth ratesbased on world bank “world development indicators” data till 2013 (till which year the gdp base for 2004-05 was fully available), we can compare the growth rates of china and india. a plot of these rates shows that the growth rate difference has been narrowing since 1990, due to a gradual deceleration of china and a stronger acceleration of india. underlying this narrowing growth difference are variables that are drivers of or correlated with gdp growth and productivity. these include foreign direct investment (fdi) and exports, which are indicators of competitiveness, and imports, which reflect openness. the difference between china and india’s fdi-gdp ratio has been on a declining trend, from about 3.5 per cent of gdp in 1990 to a little over two per cent of gdp in 2013, suggesting slow but steady progress in attracting technology and risk capital, with a milder decline in china’s attractiveness. the difference between china’s and india’s export-gdp ratio, which was eight per cent in 1990, averaged 18 per cent during 2005 to 2007 before narrowing rapidly to about one per cent in 2013, indicating that india’s exports have held up to the global decline in world trade much more effectively than china’s. the difference between china’s and india’s import-gdp, which fluctuated around an average of 7.1 per cent points between 1990 and 2007 declined dramatically to -5.2 per cent by 2011-13, indicating that the indian economy is now significantly more open than china’s.",0.018520421989934185,tracking two

2015-05-03,tn opposes two central govt. decisions regarding fishing,"file photo of tamil nadu chief minister o. panneerselvam , tamil nadu government on sunday opposed two decisions of the central government regarding fishing, saying these could in effect lead to “swamping” by foreign fishing vessels in india’s exclusive economic zone and also increase the regulatory burden on domestic fishing

had changed the definition of ‘deep sea fishing vessels’, reducing the over all length (oal) to 15 metres instead of the oal of 20 metres as per the original guidelines., further, the definition of ‘operator’ has been expanded to include ‘joint ventures’ with up to 49 per cent foreign equity, he told prime minister narendra modi in a letter., he said the procedure for engaging foreign crews has also been made easier with the removal of the requirement for prior clearance from the central government., further, as per a public notice issued on november 28, 2014, by the same department, issuing letters of permission (lop) has been expanded for deep sea fishing vessels to conduct fishing in the eez which will operate for all vessels with an oal of 15 metres and above., thus, even the existing indian coastal fishing vessels which are between an oal of 15 and 20 metres will now be required to obtain lop which was not required earlier, the chief minister said., obtaining lops from the government and voyage clearances from indian coast guard for each fishing voyage was ‘extremely impractical’, mr. panneerselvam said., he said that the new guidelines ‘are per se illegal’ because they were contrary to the existing laws since according to the territorial waters, continental shelf, exclusive economic zone and other maritime zones act 1976, a citizen of india need not get any licence or letter of authority from centre for fishing in the eez., “the rights granted to an indian citizen by an act of parliament cannot be abrogated by an executive order of the government,” panneerselvam said., according to the consolidated fdi policy published by the department of industrial policy and promotion, ministry of commerce and industry, no foreign investment was permitted in the fisheries sector and therefore, the notification dated november 12, 2014, which brings within the ambit of the operator, a joint venture company with at least 51 per cent indian equity “is not in conformity with the consolidated fdi policy circular, 2014,” mr. panneerselvam said., fishermen community across india including those in tamil nadu were strongly protesting against these, he said, adding tamil

2015-05-10,organised retail reorganising in india,"kumar rajagopalan, ceo, retailers association of india. , india’s fragmented retail sector is in a churn and two major developments last week point to the consolidation currently underway. the churn has been precipitated by the fragmented nature of the industry, the need to develop scalable models to stay ahead as also the challenges posed by the growing e-commerce industry., aditya birla group announced the consolidation of all its branded apparel businesses under one company aditya birla fashion and retail, which will be india’s largest pure play fashion and lifestyle company with a network of more than 1,800 stores spanning five million sq. ft. the company also plans to add another 200 stores this year., this was immediately followed by bharti retail announcing plans to merge with the retail operations of future retail. as per the arrangement, future retail will demerge its retail operations into bharti retail, which will demerge its retail infrastructure into future retail., kumar rajagopalan, ceo, retailers association of india (rai) “the brick and mortar (b&m) retailers have to do things to achieve scale and amid increasing consumption and competition, there is a scramble among serious players to increase scale through m&a.”, there is likely to be more m&a activity in the apparel segment but it has more to do with brand acquisition than with retail points,” arvind singhal, chairman, technopak advisors, a leading retail consultancy said., the highly competitive environment is pushing consolidation to create larger players. increasing consumption amid heavy competition demands m&a activity to create larger players to achieve financial size and scale., the extent of fragmentation in the industry can be gauged by the fact that the largest player reliance retail with a turnover in the region of rs.18,000 crore or $3 billion, accounts for a meagre share of the industry, which is estimated at $540 billion. this is likely to grow to $1 trillion by 2020, a report by boston consulting group said. there are a few majors such as reliance, future-bharti and aditya birla group. although the birlas have moved with alacrity to consolidate their apparel business, the performance of the pure-play retail chain stores under ‘more’ requires attention according to sector analysts., now newer players are emerging and regional players are getting stronger. it seems like there are fewer scale players and the attention is shifting to region-specific players for m&as., “there are not that many large players in the retail sector and those remaining are regional majors such as spencers,” said rachna nath, leader – retail, pwc india. “with fdi in multi-brand retail still not a reality, a consolidation amongst the indian players has long been on the anvil.”, fdi not an issue, the consolidation happening in the industry follows some acceptance of the fact that 100 per cent foreign direct investment (fdi) will not happen and it is left to the domestic players to grow the pie and expand their share., under the current rules, while 100 per cent foreign ownership is allowed in cash-and-carry trade, or wholesale trade, as well as single-brand retail, there is a cap of 51 per cent in multi-brand retail. also, it has been left for each state to decide whether it wants foreign ownership of multi-brand retail stores or not., in its keenness to protect interests of the smaller, unorganised trade, the government has been sending strong signals about its opposition to mega international retailers coming in. “the government has been too focused on the ownership issue and has displayed a misplaced understanding of the sector,” mr. singhal said., “pure play multinational retailers are avoiding india due to the government’s ambivalent attitude to fdi and it has been sending unwelcome signals. they are anyway already selling their products through e-commerce which is in fact an area that the government does not know how to handle,” mr. rajagopalan said., growing e-commerce challenge, the way the business is moving and the increasing thrust on e-commerce is re-proving the country’s consumption story. e-commerce or e-tailing is the recent paradigm that retailers have had to also confront and already 75 per cent of retailers have adopted e-commerce in some form and globally, retailing has already graduated to a multi-channel, omni-channel retail industry., “e-commerce has emerged out of nowhere and forced retailers to adapt. however, its growth has been predicated on excessive discounting which is not viable in the long term,” mr. singhal said., “for lifestyle brands in e-commerce, the need of the hour is to protect the brand and ensure that there is no indiscriminate discounting,” mr. rajagopalan said. “this is why leading luxury and high-end players globally as well as several leading retailers here do not offer discounts on their websites.”",0.042879939209726464,organised retail reorganising india,"kumar rajagopalan , ceo , retailers association india. , india ’ fragmented retail sector churn two major developments last week

2015-05-16,text of the keynote address by prime minister narendra modi at india-china business forum,"prime minister narendra modi addressing the indo-china business forum in shanghai on saturday. , friends!, i am really happy to be here with you. before coming to this forum, i had very detailed discussion with the ceos of major chinese companies. i am sure our interactions today will lead to benefits to the people and businesses of the two countries., alongwith me a number of officials and prominent indian ceos are also present here., as you know, china and india are two great and old civilisations of the world. they have provided many lights of knowledge on the entire human society. today, we together, represent more than one third of the global population., india and china have a common history of five thousand years and a common boundary of over three thousand and four hundred kilometers., two thousand years ago, at the invitation of the chinese emperor ming, two indian monks came to china. they brought many sanskrit scriptures on two white horses. they translated many buddhist classics and scriptures into chinese language., it is believed that they introduced buddhism in china. the king built a temple in honour of this event. the temple is popularly known as white horse temple. the temple then increased in importance as buddhism grew within china, and spread to korea, japan and vietnam., the serenity of buddhism in asian countries is the seed of their success. i strongly believe that this century belongs to asia. and buddhism will be a further unifying and catalysing force among the asian countries., your famous scholars like fa hien and hiuen tsang have taught many secrets of chinese wisdom to indians. in addition, they discovered many secrets within india itself. hiuen tsang had visited my own home town in gujarat. from his works, we know today that there was a buddhist monastery there. when hiuen tsang returned to china he brought with him sanskrit scriptures and books of wisdom. the traditional systems of medicine of the two countries based on natural elements also have a lot in common., in recent times too, this stream of knowledge is flowing across our borders. prof. ji xianlin of peking university was a great sanskrit scholar. he spent most part of his life in translating valmiki’s ramayan into chinese. indian government has honoured him by bestowing a prestigious award in 2008., more recently, prof. jin ding han has translated tulasi ramayan into chinese. translations of bhagwad gita and mahabharat are also popular with the chinese people. i thank these chinese scholars for introducing indian culture to the chinese people., friends! india has always been a knowledge society. whereas, you have been an innovating society. ancient china was highly advanced in science and technology. like indians, chinese too sailed to americas and distant corners of the world in their ships. they had the mariners’ compass and gun powder., but i must add that during this time, indian astronomy and mathematics were quite popular in china. indian astronomers were appointed on the official boards set up to prepare calendars., the indian concept of zero and that of nine planets have been helpful in discoveries in china. so, our ideas had a role to play in your innovations., thus, we have a lot in common and we can do a lot together. as we helped each other growing spiritually, we have to help each other growing economically. there are instances of such economic exchanges in the past. it is believed that china gave silk and paper to india. we both have potentials of growth and problems of poverty which we can tackle together. i am personally committed to take the co-operative process forward., that is why even as chief minister of gujarat, i visited china. as prime minister too i am convinced and committed for exchange and co-operation for socio-economic development of the two countries., i have lot of hope from the relationship which i and president xi are trying to build. during his visit to india in september 2014, chinese investments worth 20 billion us dollars (rs. 12 lakh-crore) were committed. we signed 12 agreements covering industrial parks, railways, credit and leasing, with cumulative amount of investments of 13 billion us dollars., we are very keen to develop the sectors where china is strong. we need your involvement. the scope and potential, the breadth and length of infrastructure and related developments is very huge in india. just to give you some examples:, • we have planned to build 50 million houses by 2022. in addition, we are going to develop smart cities and mega industrial corridors;, • for this purpose, we have refined our fdi policy in construction. we are also coming up with a regulatory framework for this sector;, • we have targeted 175 giga watts of renewable energy in next few years. in addition to generation, the issues of transmission and distribution of electricity are equally important for us;, • we are modernizing our railway systems including signals, engines and railway stations. we are planning metro rail in fifty cities and high speed trains in various corridors;, • similar is the case with highways which we want to build in faster way;, • we are putting up new ports and modernizing the old ones through an ambitious plan called sagarmala;, • similar focus is on upgrading the existing airports and putting up regional airports to enhance connectivity to places of economic and tourist importance;, • in financial services too, we are moving towards a more inclusive and faster delivery of financial products including bank loans and insurance;, • for this purpose we opened 140 million bank accounts; increased fdi in insurance upto 49% and have set up mudra bank to fund the micro-businesses;, • recently, i have launched innovative schemes for insurance and pension to enhance social security of our citizens., in march this year, i had a discussion with jack ma of alibaba in delhi about possible co-operation for strengthening this micro-credit sector of india., as you have successfully done, we also want to promote manufacturing in a big way particularly to create jobs for our youth who form 65% of our population., hence, we want to make things in india. for this purpose, we have launched a campaign called “make in india”. it is also the effort of my government to encourage innovation, r&d and entrepreneurship in the country. in this year’s budget, we have set up some innovative institutional mechanisms for that purpose., we have to learn from you about the development of labor-intensive industries, creating conditions for sustainable foreign direct investment, skill development, infrastructure creation and export-led development model., all this is a historic opportunity for the chinese companies. you would already be knowing the direction of my government and the steps we are taking. we have committed ourselves for creating and improving the business environment. i can assure you that once you decide to be in india, we are confident to make you more and more comfortable., many chinese companies have the possibility of investing in india to take advantage of india’s potentials. the potential lies in manufacturing, processing as well as in infrastructure., i am here to assure you that india’s economic environment has changed. our regulatory regime is much more transparent, responsive and stable. we are taking a long-term and futuristic view on the issues. lot of efforts have been made and are still underway to improve the ‘ease of doing business’. we do believe that fdi is important and it will not come in the country without a globally competitive business environment. therefore, we have rationalized a number of issues which were bothering the investors., in particular,, • we are making the taxation system transparent, stable and predictable., • we have removed lot of regressive taxation regimes. in our very first budget, we said we will not resort to retrospective taxation., • we are reducing the complicated procedures, making them available at one platform, preferably online;, • simplifying the forms and formats has been taken up on war footing., • definite mechanisms for hand holding have been set up in the form of hub and spoke model. invest india is the nodal agency for this purpose., • in this year’s budget, we allowed tax pass through for aifs, rationalization of capital gains of reits, modification in pe norms and deferring the implementation of gaar for two years., • we have fast tracked approvals in industry and infrastructure. this includes environmental clearances, extending the industrial licences, delicencing of defence items, and simplification of cross-border trade., • within a very short time, we introduced gst bill in parliament., similarly, for infrastructure development, we have taken some far reaching steps., • first of all we have made an all-time high allocation for roads and railways sectors., • in addition, we are setting up india infrastructure investment fund., • we have also allowed tax free bonds in the infrastructure sector including roads and railways., we know that a lot more has to be done. but we are committed to take this process forward. we are constantly working to improve the business environment further., however, our initial measures have helped in building up an enhanced investor confidence. the sentiments for private investment and inflow of foreign investment are positive. fdi inflows have gone up by 39% during april-2014 and february-2015 against the same period in previous year;, our growth rate is above 7%. most of the international financial institutions including the world bank, imf, oecd and others are predicting even faster growth and even better in the coming years. moody’s have recently upgraded the rating of india as positive on account of our concrete steps in various economic fields., friends! indo-chinese partnership should and will flourish. i expect very good outcome from this coming together. we have complemented each other in the past. we can complement in the present and future too. as two major economies in asia, the harmonious partnership between india and china is essential for economic development and political stability of the continent. you are the ‘factory of the world’. whereas, we are the ‘back office of the world’. you give thrust on production of hardware, while india focuses on software and services., similarly, indian component manufacturers have been masters in high-quality precision and the chinese players have mastered the art of mass production. the component design expertise of indian engineers and low cost mass production by china can cater to the global markets in a better way. this industrial partnership of china and india can bring about greater investment, employment and satisfaction of our people.",0.15881846110878362,text keynote address prime minister narendra modi india-china business forum,"prime minister narendra modi addressing indo-china business forum shanghai saturday. ,

2015-05-18,learning skills from seoul,"in his first year of office, prime minister narendra modi has chosen his foreign destinations with careful thought. after wrapping up his visits to> china and >mongolia, mr. modi will be in korea on may 18 and 19 in recognition of the country’s potential importance in pushing the agenda of >‘make in india’, skill development, employment generation and indigenisation of defence manufacturing., the stage for the visit has already been set by external affairs minister sushma swaraj, who had, in december 2014, visited seoul for the 8th joint commission meeting. defence minister manohar parrikar also went to seoul in april to identify projects for closer defence collaboration., south korea and india have both economic and cultural ties, apart from similar historical trajectories. their ancient bonds are based on the twin strands of buddhism and the princess of ayodhya. koreans widely believe that a princess from ayodhya travelled by sea to korea in 48ce and married king kim suro. a prominent branch of the kim clan called the gimhae kims proudly claim this indian lineage. the two countries also share bitter colonial experiences; they had to undergo post-independence horrors of partition. both continue to face hostile nuclear siblings: pakistan and north korea, respectively., economic engagementdespite this, india and south korea did not take much notice of each other till the end of the 1970s. a nonaligned india pursued a policy of equal treatment of the two koreas, which it finally abandoned in the 1980s.the emergence of south korea as an asian tiger compelled india to look at it as a source of investment and technology. the dawn of real democracy in south korea in the late 1980s brought it ideologically closer to india. the end of the cold war and former prime minister narasimha rao’s ‘look east policy’ opened the doors for a rapid economic engagement with south korea., korean chaebols such as samsung, lg and hyundai motors invested heavily in india in the late 1990s.their success in capturing the indian market is visible all around us. korean investment in india is now more than $3 billion. indian companies such as tata motors, the mahindra group and birla group have also invested more than a billion dollars in south korea., the first decade of the new millennium saw a rapid expansion of both economic and political relations. in 2010, india and south korea became ‘strategic partners’ and implemented the comprehensive economic partnership agreement (cepa). bilateral trade surged to $20 billion in 2011, surpassing india’s trade with japan. however, economic activities have been somewhat stagnant since then and require renewed energy and new ideas. for instance, the much-heralded $12 billion investment by the korean steelmaker posco in odisha has been stuck since 2005 in the quagmire of procedures for mining licences, land acquisition and environmental clearances. both countries focus on the economic prosperity of their citizens. on strategic regional issues, they strive for a stable and peaceful external environment. however, south korean president park geun-hye and mr. modi differ widely on the other two regional giants: china and japan. no consensus on this is expected at this summit., in this background, prime minister modi has clear objectives, but difficult issues to address. south korean corporates have rich experiences of working in rather difficult indian conditions but before investing more, they may wait for conditions to improve., prime minister modi will benefit from studying the korean experience of rapid skill development in the 1960s and 1970s. the impressive industrial miracle of south korea is based on its trained and dedicated manpower. the system of vocational training, technical education as well as research and development is driven by the requirements of industry. in these areas, india’s efforts are largely government-driven and practically divorced from industry requirements. mr. modi would also be surprised to learn that 3.4 per cent of korean gdp is spent on research and innovation and 70 per cent of this amount comes from industry!, lessons from shipbuildingin the shipbuilding sector, south korea has world class technology, but india has obsolescent equipment and management. creative policy changes would be required in india to motivate korean private shipbuilders to invest in india. koreans by nature do not like joint ventures, guard their technology carefully and demand full managerial control. just as the rao government had allowed 100 per cent fdi to korean companies in 1996 as a pioneering policy change, the modi government should offer to lease a shipyard to the koreans for the long-term on negotiated terms. such a move would attract the koreans to not only invest in shipbuilding in india but also bring in modern technology and equipment. also, it is hoped that prime minister modi’s visit will reopen the stalled negotiations for the acquisition of eight minesweepers from kangnam company, which would be partly built at the goa shipyard., during the visit, mr. modi is likely to face some pressure from president park for urgent revision of the cepa. however, he must be cautious as the present cepa has not generated any extra exports from india, and the bilateral trade gap is widening against india. despite assurances, the korean regulators continue to drag their feet in according approvals for import of indian generic drugs and agricultural products. indian it companies have also been struggling for business in south korea as koreans hesitate in sharing data with outsiders., koreans may also press for the allocation of a site for korean companies to build a nuclear power plant. they may offer state of the art technology and their overall costs for erecting a project would be about 20 per cent less than their competitors. in turn, india could offer to launch korean

2015-05-19,kick-starting an economic revival,"when narendra modi took oath as prime minister on may 26, 2014, there were great expectations from him making decisive moves to put the economy back in recovery mode and on to a high growth trajectory of a ‘10+’ per cent per year growth rate. it is ‘10+’ because the finance ministry had chosen to use paasche’s index instead of laspeyres index to calculate growth rate, which, under present inflationary conditions, will artificially raise growth rate figures (see paul samuelson and subramanian swamy, “invariant economic index numbers and canonical duality”, american economic review, 1974, and also economic journal, 1984 for the reasons.), hence, what i have been stating in the past, of a 10 per cent growth rate target as being desirable is now, by the finance ministry’s revaluation of index numbers, more than a 10 per cent target now, perhaps even 12 per cent., the blueprint for such a recovery, to a ‘10+’ growth rate, had already been prepared before the general election, and the steps to be taken were documented by a committee of the bharatiya janata party. nitin gadkari, now union minister for road transport, highways and shipping, had been entrusted with task. on his suggestion, i had collaborated with a number of committed intellectuals to produce a ‘vision document 2020’, a road map for mr. modi to implement as soon as he became the prime minister. these steps have still to be taken., regressive markers the regressive markers in the projected path of the economy today make it worrisome as these indicate that if not rectified soon, the indian economy can go into a tailspin. though these markers are a consequence of the disastrous tenure of the previous government, now nearly a year on, they cease to be a credible excuse., some of these markers are: the basel iii norms for banks (effective from 2018) which require rs.2,40,000 crore for capitalisation. moreover, to retain 51 per cent of the equity of public sector banks by the government, it will need, this financial year, rs.1,21,000 crore. the 2015-16 budget has provided for only rs.11,200 crore, which is not even a tenth of this. with rising non-performing assets of banks, there is a risk of a banking crash much like the 1997-98 east asian crash., this year, the rainfall deficit affecting 67 per cent of the single crop farmers, will cause inflationary pressures and a substantial shortfall in production, thus causing more misery to the farmer. while rainfall is in nobody’s control, the economy, even today, lacks the necessary financial cushion to absorb the liabilities arising from crop failure and farmer destitution., the rupee is on the edge of a fall as it happened in 2012-13. this is because there has been a large-scale sell-off or dumping of shares of indian companies purchased by foreign investors earlier last year. some foreign direct investment (fdi) companies have also pulled out. the fall in the rupee was a little moderated three months ago, but for the wrong reason: the increased inflow of funds from the subversive, corroding, money-laundering participatory notes (pn) derivative. but pns are hot money derivatives and so can be pulled out anytime to cause a further devaluation of the rupee., all these destabilising trends have had a profound impact on the stock market. one of these is in the form of market valuations now being well below the long-term average and even below the level in 2013. therefore, it is no surprise that the top 10 corporate entities have reached a stage where their annual profits do not cover even their yearly debt repayments., negative factors while india has demonstrated impressive prowess in it, biotechnology, automobile ancillaries and pharmaceuticals, and has also accelerated its growth rate to become the third largest nation in terms of gdp at ppp rates, nevertheless, it still has a backward, agricultural sector employing 62 per cent of the labour force and where farmers are ending their lives unable to repay their loans., the indian economy is also saddled with a national unemployment rate that is over 15 per cent of the adult labour force, and a prevalence of child labour arising out of nearly 50 per cent of children not making it to school beyond standard five, a deeply malfunctioning primary and secondary educational system, 300 million illiterates and 250 million people in a dire state of poverty., moreover, india’s educated youth is skill deficient, risk averse in attitude and largely unemployable in the cutting-edge manufacturing sector. according to macaulay’s minute on education, our universities still produce clerks for government administration and not innovators of the future., besides these, india’s infrastructure is in a pathetic state, with frequent power breakdowns even in metropolitan cities, a dangerously unhealthy water supply system in urban areas, and a very poor road network where there are gaping holes even on the national highways., india’s infrastructure requires about $150 billion to make it world class, while the education system needs six per cent of gdp instead of 2.8 per cent today., need for reform these problems can be addressed only by comprehensive, second generation, systemic reform that makes the economy an efficient, competitive market oriented one that leverages our potentialities (such as our civilizational heritage of innovative intellect), and which minimises the inefficiency, squandering and corruption in the deployment of our vast resources., india has much potential today to become a booming economy; it has a demographic dividend of a young population of average age of 28 years compared to china’s 35 years, the u.s.’s 38 years, europe’s 46 years and japan’s 49 years., internationally, indian agriculture has the lowest yield in land and livestock-based milk products whose yield can easily be raised judging by the performance in experimental agricultural plots of the indian agricultural research institute (iari) and the indian council of agricultural research (icar) and by also borrowing agricultural techniques from israel. indian agriculture and milk products are also internationally at a low cost of production. with proper infrastructure and packaging, india can certainly become a global player in agricultural exports., even though india is also gifted with a full 12 months a year of farm-friendly weather, it grows just one crop a year in over 75 per cent of arable land when it can grow three crops a year. it also has the advantage of a highly competitive, skilled labour force and low wage rates at the national level, the advantages of which have been already proved to the world by the outsourcing phenomenon. what is needed is a bold commitment of sufficient resources to harvest this potential., an open competitive market system can find these resources as has been demonstrated in the auction of the 2g spectrum licences if the quality of governance and accountability is improved., a transparent policy regime, auctioning of natural resources (if it is used for commercial private enterprise), and the unearthing of the vast $1.5 trillion in black money stashed abroad will enable the government to marshal sufficient resources for a massive investment in a second generation economic reform while reducing the tax burden on people.",0.03688492063492063,kick-starting economic revival,"narendra modi took oath prime minister may 26 , 2014 , great expectations making decisive moves put economy back

2015-05-25,the current account paradox,"recent trends in india’s current account and their impact on the balance of payments and the larger economy, present an interesting study. the current account deficit (cad) is the difference between the sum total of imports and all outward remittances on the one hand and the sum total of all exports and inward remittances on the other., an obvious observation from recent cad data is that it is so comprehensively dependent upon external factors over which indian policy makers have so very little control., for instance, global oil prices have a large say on india’s cad. the nda government was fortunate in one important sense — the unexpected fall in global oil prices caused a reduction in the import bill and consequently in the extent of the deficit., the reduction was particularly welcome. during the period 2011-13 the cad rose from below three per cent of the gdp to above five per cent. this made india particularly vulnerable to shocks. the exchange rate of the rupee fluctuated violently and posed challenges to the rbi. even before the american taper induced depreciation the indian currency fell by 20 per cent. in the wake of the taper — the u.s. authorities announced the end of their ultra soft monetary policy — it lost another 20 per cent., thanks to some deft moves by the rbi and the imposition of quantitative restrictions on gold imports by the government, the rupee rallied during the second half of 2013-14.the rupee derived a lot of strength from the vastly improved sentiment that has come about with the change in the government. during the first half of the financial year, the positive trends continued. petroleum prices continued to fall. the government seemed to embark on a series of reform measures. pacts were signed with a number of countries. these promised more trade and a larger fdi investment. the logjam over coal appeared to be getting resolved with not a little help from the supreme court., .a flurry of announcements seem to herald major banking sector reform. in short, the first year of the nda government appeared to be extremely favourable for overseas investors. no surprise really that the foreign institutional investors contributing the bulk of foreign investment continued to patronise the stock markets .they were helped considerably by the continuance of ultra soft monetary policies by the u.s. fed reserve., stock markets lend gloss, stock market behaviour needs to be analysed from many angles. a dispassionate analysis will throw up some factors that are negative and some positive. however, during most of the time the nda government has been in office, the rise of the stock markets has had nothing to do with economic fundamentals or corporate results. the market's optimism has been based on flimsy optimism., but for the balance of payments, the continued flow of fii investment has been good news. puffed up market seemed to indicate all was well with the economy. the crucial dependence of the current account on short-term, volatile flows — which might reverse anytime — has once again been blithely brushed aside., in short, the early months of the nda government might have bred complacency. the window of opportunity that the government had to carry out the more difficult reforms might have been missed. specifically for the external sector, the following developments are ominous:, slipping over oil, one: oil prices are up again. no expert is willing to hazard a guess as to how much higher they will go over the near term. the geopolitical situation remains fluid. the public sector character of the oil marketing companies might have prevented them from hedging their oil purchases., two: gold imports have surged partly due to low prices and partly due to pent up demand. the new gold monetisation, still at the draft stage, has certain welcome features. even small quantities of gold can be accepted as deposits. banks can pay the interest in gold. however, in common with the schemes it replaces, the new scheme has one major weakness. it is highly unlikely that individual households will surrender their ornaments for investing in a gold deposit. normally households do not stock gold bars. jewellery has a sentimental value that cannot be made good by a deposit scheme, however well designed. it is conceded, however, that the new scheme has to be given a fair trial for the sake of luring investors away from the lure of holding physical gold., three: despite the success of coal auctions, india will remain a net importer of

2015-05-29,the chinese fault line in foreign policy,"this is the season of results and of drawing up report cards. having completed a year of governance, the bharatiya janata party-led government’s performance is up for review, with its approach on the foreign policy front attracting a great deal of attention. not surprisingly, political pundits have accorded it an ‘a’. nevertheless, it still merits a more detailed look., prime minister narendra modi’s record of visiting 18 countries in 57 days has to be appreciated. yet, it should not be overlooked that even a less ebullient prime minister like dr. manmohan singh of the predecessor united progressive alliance government managed a hectic schedule during his first year in office. but two major differences, no doubt, exist. the first is that in marked contrast to visits by previous prime ministers to foreign countries, each of mr. modi’s visits has involved detailed planning to ensure the best teleological impact., the second is in terms of economic content — new business openings, substantial increases in foreign direct investment (fdi) flows, estimated to be around $28.8 billion, and talk of india as being the next big investment destination. if the raison d’être of high profile prime ministerial visits is business with a big ‘b’, then mr. modi has made a spectacular start., mixed resultsboth aspects are in keeping with the prime minister’s penchant for transformational initiatives, an aspect that was evident during his more than a year-long election campaign. foreign visits have the added advantage of linking the prime minister’s persona with outcomes, and where the prime minister’s image becomes the crucial selling point. mr. modi’s visit to the united states in 2014 demonstrated what impact a brilliantly calibrated campaign could produce., however, on many of the substantive issues, the balance sheet tends to be mixed. for instance, the prime minister kept his commitment to pursue an “activist neighbourhood policy”. yet, to claim that his visits have already produced concrete results would be premature. foreign policy outcomes need a long period of gestation and it would be naive to think that a single visit would alter another country’s policies. this is particularly true of countries like sri lanka and nepal who tend to hedge their bets when it comes to india versus china. nevertheless, the energy and drive on display has helped push the boundaries, enabling india to demonstrate its determination to be the pre-eminent power in the region., coming to strategic aspects, one discerns a certain lack of coherence and consistency. this is specially true of strategic relations with our two biggest neighbours, china and pakistan. vis-à-vis pakistan, the inconsistencies in our attitude have further compounded the dysfunctional nature of pakistan’s approach to india. nothing that has been said or done during the past year has reduced tensions between the two countries. if anything, the degree of suspicion has increased., dealing with beijingthe approach towards china has clearly needed to be more subtle and dexterous than has been the case. the bonhomie on display during chinese president xi jinping’s visit to india in september 2014 and mr. modi’s visit to china in may 2015 was exceptional. notwithstanding this, the hype and glamour have tended to obscure the reality that little progress on most aspects of the relationship has taken place. mr. modi’s recent visit did yield much in economic terms — agreements and business-related memoranda of understanding worth at least $22 billion. he also unveiled a vision of unlimited opportunities for chinese business and investment in infrastructure and energy-related projects. the joint statement issued after the visit is extremely positive on trade, development and investment issues, and also on taking the necessary measures “to remove impediments to bilateral trade and investment and facilitate greater market access”., however, dealing with china is like dealing with the unknown. rather than protocol-driven statements, one needs to look out for signals and nuances which are often better indicators of where the relationship is headed. hence, references in the joint statement issued after mr. modi’s discussions with chinese leaders, to the “historic imperative for india and china to enrich their bilateral relations” and that “india-china bilateral relations are poised to play a defining role in the 21st century in asia and globally”, count for little. in specific terms, the chinese have given no indication, whatsoever, that they would back india’s claim to a seat in the united nations security council; no assurance of helping india with nuclear export control regimes, and in overcoming the remaining obstacles to nuclear trade issues, and no signs of softening its stance on the vexed boundary question, merely committing itself to maintaining peace and tranquillity in the border areas, pending a final resolution. as a keen observer, the prime minister would certainly have noted the absence of any reaction from the chinese side during the visit, to both the contents of the joint strategic vision for the asia-pacific and the indian ocean region (unveiled by him and u.s. president barack obama during mr. obama’s visit to india in january 2015), and to the deepening of india’s relations with shinzo¯ abe’s japan. this is significant and disconcerting, compounded further by the absence of any serious discussion on the situation prevailing in pakistan and west asia, and the implications for the region of mr. xi’s signature initiative viz., the maritime silk road. apparently, the chinese believe that there is not much scope for a meeting of minds on crucial issues., the afghan vacuummeanwhile, china continues to engage in a series of moves that are highly detrimental to india’s interests. with pakistan as the fulcrum of china’s approach to south asia, china is now seeking to exploit the vacuum in afghanistan, at a time when india’s leverage there has been greatly reduced following afghanistan president ashraf ghani taking charge. china has also very recently hosted “secret talks” between afghan and taliban leaders in china, which were attended by both chinese officials and representatives of pakistan’s inter-services intelligence (isi). china also continues to stall india’s moves in the united nations to have hizbul mujahideen chief and head of the ‘united jihad council’, syed salahuddin declared as a “global terrorist”. the proposed china-pakistan economic corridor linking western china with the gwadar port in pakistan through pakistan occupied kashmir (pok), is an even more serious matter, directly impinging on india’s sovereignty and security. its implications are far graver than the border dispute between india and china.",0.10080700227607443,chinese fault line foreign policy,"season results drawing report cards.

2015-08-08,p-notes require more stringent monitoring,"way back in 2005, the then reserve bank of india (rbi) governor y. v. reddy spoke on the need for a view be taken on the ‘quantity and quality of fii flows’ and expressed the need for taxing or capping such flows. immediately, the then finance minister p. chidambaram denied any such moves, constraining mr. reddy to clarify his statement., the issue again came up for discussion recently as the special investigation team (sit) on black money in its third report pointed out to the supreme court that the overseas derivative instruments (odis), popularly known as participatory notes (p-notes), were used from destinations such as the cayman islands, a tax haven., india allowed fiis to invest in indian capital market since 1992. as the know-your-investor or know-your-client (kyc) norms were applicable for these foreign funds, the fiis started to issue p-notes, which helped the beneficiary (end-user) to remain anonymous. p-notes are, in essence, overseas derivatives instruments (odis), which have indian stocks and derivatives as their underlying securities., as per reports, p-notes comprise around 15 to 20 per cent of the total fii investments in the country since 2009. while it held around 25 to 40 per cent in 2008, it was as high as 50 per cent in 2007., concerned with tax evasion through the stock market route and in an effort to curb black money, the sit also suggested to the government to obtain details of beneficial ownership or the end-user, which should be known to the capital market regulator, securities and exchange board of india (sebi)., around the same time when mr. reddy had raised the issue of hot money, the then sebi chairman m. damodaran also presumably held the same view of mr. reddy on such foreign inflows. however, in those days, the government or the finance ministry was reluctant to take further action and forced the financial regulators to retract on their stand. the investments through p-notes were legitimised by sebi in 2002, when d. r. mehta was the chairman of the capital market regulator., mr. reddy had said that there was scope for enhancing quality of flows through a review of policies relating to eligibility for registration as fiis, and assessment of risks involved in flows through hedge funds, participatory notes, sub-accounts etc. “strict adherence to ‘know your investor’ principle, especially in regard to flows from tax-havens, including beneficial ownership would enhance quality,” he pointed out. his concern: the magnitudes of fdi/ fii flows are tending to be large and volatility has perhaps increased. the impact of such flows on the stock markets is discernible, but perhaps less evident at this juncture in corporate ownership and control., now under the new foreign portfolio investors (fpis) regime, which came into effect from 2014, the regulator had segregated the fiis into several categories., “the fundamental worry we are having is that whether hot money or inappropriate funds are coming into the country,” said harish h. v. partner, grant thornton india llp. according to him, there is always been a suspicion that this route has been used for laundering funds., “while some pns may be genuine some others could be illegal funds. but fpis should give conformity to the funds that brought in with all documentation,” he said., however, sandeep parekh, founder, finsec law advisors, said that these were highly regulated products and beneficiary was known on a monthly basis to sebi and daily basis to fpi. “but there is no daily monitoring of the beneficial ownership (end-user) by the regulator, which is a must.”, sebi officials also reportedly accepted the views of the sit, though not fully. the sit in its third report on july 25 had suggested to the regulator to put in place an effective mechanism to monitor any unusual rise in stock prices and inform other agencies such as cbdt and financial intelligence unit (fiu) for necessary action., the outstanding value of odis at the end of february 2015 stood at rs.2,715 lakh crore. the top five locations of end-beneficial owner of odis were cayman islands, the u.s., the u.k., mauritius and bermuda contributing to 31.3 per cent, 14.2 per cent, 13.5 per cent, 9.9 per cent and 9.1 per cent respectively of total odis outstanding.",0.07097535117943281,p-notes

2015-08-08,p-notes require more stringent monitoring,"way back in 2005, the then reserve bank of india (rbi) governor y. v. reddy spoke on the need for a view be taken on the ‘quantity and quality of fii flows’ and expressed the need for taxing or capping such flows. immediately, the then finance minister p. chidambaram denied any such moves, constraining mr. reddy to clarify his statement., the issue again came up for discussion recently as the special investigation team (sit) on black money in its third report pointed out to the supreme court that the overseas derivative instruments (odis), popularly known as participatory notes (p-notes), were used from destinations such as the cayman islands, a tax haven., india allowed fiis to invest in indian capital market since 1992. as the know-your-investor or know-your-client (kyc) norms were applicable for these foreign funds, the fiis started to issue p-notes, which helped the beneficiary (end-user) to remain anonymous. p-notes are, in essence, overseas derivatives instruments (odis), which have indian stocks and derivatives as their underlying securities., as per reports, p-notes comprise around 15 to 20 per cent of the total fii investments in the country since 2009. while it held around 25 to 40 per cent in 2008, it was as high as 50 per cent in 2007., concerned with tax evasion through the stock market route and in an effort to curb black money, the sit also suggested to the government to obtain details of beneficial ownership or the end-user, which should be known to the capital market regulator, securities and exchange board of india (sebi)., around the same time when mr. reddy had raised the issue of hot money, the then sebi chairman m. damodaran also presumably held the same view of mr. reddy on such foreign inflows. however, in those days, the government or the finance ministry was reluctant to take further action and forced the financial regulators to retract on their stand. the investments through p-notes were legitimised by sebi in 2002, when d. r. mehta was the chairman of the capital market regulator., mr. reddy had said that there was scope for enhancing quality of flows through a review of policies relating to eligibility for registration as fiis, and assessment of risks involved in flows through hedge funds, participatory notes, sub-accounts etc. “strict adherence to ‘know your investor’ principle, especially in regard to flows from tax-havens, including beneficial ownership would enhance quality,” he pointed out. his concern: the magnitudes of fdi/ fii flows are tending to be large and volatility has perhaps increased. the impact of such flows on the stock markets is discernible, but perhaps less evident at this juncture in corporate ownership and control., now under the new foreign portfolio investors (fpis) regime, which came into effect from 2014, the regulator had segregated the fiis into several categories., “the fundamental worry we are having is that whether hot money or inappropriate funds are coming into the country,” said harish h. v. partner, grant thornton india llp. according to him, there is always been a suspicion that this route has been used for laundering funds., “while some pns may be genuine some others could be illegal funds. but fpis should give conformity to the funds that brought in with all documentation,” he said., however, sandeep parekh, founder, finsec law advisors, said that these were highly regulated products and beneficiary was known on a monthly basis to sebi and daily basis to fpi. “but there is no daily monitoring of the beneficial ownership (end-user) by the regulator, which is a must.”, sebi officials also reportedly accepted the views of the sit, though not fully. the sit in its third report on july 25 had suggested to the regulator to put in place an effective mechanism to monitor any unusual rise in stock prices and inform other agencies such as cbdt and financial intelligence unit (fiu) for necessary action., the outstanding value of odis at the end of february 2015 stood at rs.2,715 lakh crore. the top five locations of end-beneficial owner of odis were cayman islands, the u.s., the u.k., mauritius and bermuda contributing to 31.3 per cent, 14.2 per cent, 13.5 per cent, 9.9 per cent and 9.1 per cent respectively of total odis outstanding.",0.07097535117943281,p-notes

2015-09-09,india will emerge as the investors’ choice,"since the beginning of 2015, the global economy has been fraught with tantrum episodes. these include events like the shift towards anticipated monetary policy normalisation by the >u.s. federal reserve in march; the greek debt drama in june; further slide in global commodity prices from july onwards; and last but not the least, signs of financial stress in emerging markets triggered by the unexpected currency devaluation by china in august., to put things into perspective, except for the idiosyncratic greek debt drama, the other global crosscurrents are a manifestation of tectonic shifts in the world order. the realisation that emerging markets are now slowing down after enjoying unbridled growth for more than a decade, along with the expectations of a move by u.s. central bank towards the first interest rate hike in nearly a decade, has spooked global investors. policymakers in countries witnessing subdued growth conditions have been forced to adopt a mix of conventional and unconventional measures to support growth. the surprise yuan devaluation by china has triggered a ‘mini currency war’ across the currency markets in emerging economies, something that got exacerbated by the ongoing weakness in commodity prices., india has not remained unscathed as investor sentiments here are generally susceptible to a kneejerk reaction. over the last one month, the benchmark nifty index has gone down by 8 per cent while the rupee has become weaker weaker by 3.1 per cent., however, i am firmly of the opinion that, once the dust surrounding negative global sentiments settles down, investors will start cherry-picking, with india emerging as a default choice for almost every global investor., the indian economy has made phenomenal macro strides in the last two years. economic growth has accelerated by 2.2 per cent even as inflation has declined by 4 per cent. the current account and fiscal deficits have corrected by 3.3 per cent and 0.5 per cent of gdp respectively. the economy is better protected than it was in 2013, with the reserve bank of india (rbi) augmenting its reserves by over $80 billion since mid-2013., the macroeconomic situation in india appears robust from various vantage points. for global investors, the india growth story happens to be one of the safest hedges against falling commodity prices. as a matter of fact, india is one of the few large emerging markets that is poised to see further acceleration in growth momentum in 2015 and beyond. the public sector balance sheet is gradually consolidating with quality of adjustment being the key positive switch factor., the favourable macro outlook is not by accident. policymakers over the last two years have shown the gumption to take tough decisions. curtailment in food inflation through structural and tactical steps like restrained adjustment to minimum support prices (msps), timely use of buffer stocks, and efficient alignment of food related export import (exim) policy has proved to be a resounding success. it is surprising that not many commentators highlight this important macro feat., with private sector still being risk averse, the government is deploying capital expenditure for jumpstarting investment and growth revival despite the fiscal objective of consolidation. ministries like renewable energy, roads, railways and micro, small and medium enterprises (msme) seem to be on a hyper-drive with strong capital expenditure disbursals., the direction of reform process has been laid out with every quarter adding towards incremental progress. the success in clearing the policy mess in india’s natural resources (mines, spectrum, etc.) has infused transparency and reliability in government processes. despite labour being a state subject, the government is laying the framework for composite labour reforms. while the good and services tax (gst) could not see the light of the day during the recently concluded monsoon session of the parliament, the framework seems to be in place and i am confident that the bill will get legislative approval sooner than later. these steps have restored confidence while giving an immense boost to policy credibility., from an investor’s perspective, it is not just about improving the growth-inflation dynamics. what is important is to be able to sustain the improvement process in the longer run. this government, ever since it assumed power, has been emphasising the ease of doing business in india. in recent speeches, both the prime minister and the finance minister have indicated that india will increasingly favour a more open economy. foreign direct investment (fdi) restrictions are getting relaxed, non-discretionary project approvals are getting digitised, the much needed bankruptcy code is getting finalised.",0.07443397760299167,india emerge investors ’ choice,"since beginning 2015 , global economy fraught tantrum episodes. include events like shift towards anticipated monetary policy normalisation >u.s. federal reserve march ;

2015-09-23,modi’s unrealistic american dreams,"there is at least one dimension in which the distance between narendra modi and jawaharlal nehru is not so great after all. i speak not of their fondness for the bandgala but of their >penchant for world travel. not a day passes without us being informed of some impending visit by our prime minister. right now, we are being bombarded with the details of the itinerary of his visit to the u.s. later this month. he will start, we’re told, with the annual meeting of the u.n. general assembly and from there proceed to the west coast., nehru had undertaken this journey too, in 1949. however, we were a different country then, having inherited a bloodily-partitioned nation with a declining per capita income. on the other hand, india is today one of the world’s fastest-growing economies, hoarding a young labour stock and a substantial talent pool, making the task of its leadership a little easier by comparison., while india must constantly engage with the rest of the world at all levels, the rest of the world does not hold the key to either the pace or inclusiveness of its economic growth. it is, therefore, altogether surprising that the leader of india should travel westward urging “come make in india.”, india’s unique place in world order india is made to appear as a supplicant when no one asks it to be one. nehru himself had travelled the world as the torchbearer both of an ancient civilisation and a cosmopolitan internationalism with roots in the west to which he considered himself a natural heir. till the 1990s, many an indian abroad would have been the beneficiary of praise from african students and american workers for india’s role in hastening the process of decolonisation. it is not without significance that india had been the first port of call for nelson mandela after the end of apartheid in south africa., before it comes to be imagined that nehru’s forays into the wider world had amounted only to showcasing indian attire, we may want to remember that extraordinary financial inflows had been elicited then. non-alignment brought with it an unexpected reward as the rival ideological blocks vied with one another to shower india with aid. over a quarter of the total financing for the second five-year plan was via official aid from the rest of the world. michal kalecki, the astute polish economist who was one among many intellectuals who had made a beeline for this quickening country, had remarked pithily that india’s policy of non-alignment was akin to “a clever calf sucking milk from two cows!”, it is also of interest that nehru had shown no particular anxiety over wanting india as a permanent member of the u.n. security council, even as he thanklessly championed communist china’s claims. it is not known what exactly he had thought of the prize itself, but it could not have escaped his attention that even when it was not a cabal of the rich and powerful it could hardly count as a democratic arrangement. contrast this with india’s desperate attempts today to gain membership of this discredited club. but of course the world has changed since the fifties. apartheid and colonialism have vanished, and china is firmly entrenched in the security council, and one might say with nary a thought for india’s inclusion., so, one should not expect >mr. modi to travel to the u.s. with an anachronistic agenda. yet, one may expect him to be clear of what it will yield in relation to india’s current priorities. an argument is usually made out in terms of attracting foreign direct investment (fdi) and, possibly, technology to drive the ‘digital india’ programme., it is incontestable that both foreign investment and the spread of information and communications technology are very important for india. in fact, every effort must be made to accelerate their adoption. however, on fdi, much of what can be achieved via enabling legislation has been achieved. further, the tariff barrier to trade has been rescinded along with quantitative controls., foreign trade accounts for more than 50 per cent of the indian economy by now. however, the promised gains in manufacturing are disappointing, suggesting that domestic supply and demand conditions may be at least as important for indian manufacturing as is an open trade regime. it is indeed correct that fdi has increased exponentially over the past one year, suggesting to some that this reflects a new international confidence in india’s economy. while the figure is impressive it is not unprecedented. in any case, fdi accounts for less than 10 per cent of total capital formation in the country. as for the it tsars mr. modi is to meet in silicon valley, the u.s.-based it industry, with its significant indian presence, has long ago sensed the profit opportunity in engaging with india and does not need handholding. so it is likely to bide its time., altogether, while the government is right to pursue foreign investment and technology, it does give the impression of not giving as much importance to other areas. without suggesting what these areas are, we might suggest that soon as the pm returns from abroad he goes on a virtual bharat darshan. he could even remain in the pmo while travelling backwards in a time-machine. what would be the things that he will get to see?, domestic issues, imported solutions he will find a farmer committing suicide in hyderabad because he couldn’t afford medical care for his son. he will find that in bihar, to which state he has promised an out-of-turn special assistance of rs. 1.25 lakh crore, the overwhelming majority of rural households do not have access to sanitation. in delhi, he will find a doctor of the all india institute of medical sciences (aiims) announce on television that dengue is “endemic” to its population, a grave diagnosis indeed. in rajasthan, a state run by his own party, he would find that a senior civil servant ran an extortion racket yielding four crores in ready rupees, thus taking the meaning of “ease of doing business” to an altogether new level. so, alighting from the time machine, he is likely to be struck by the thought that while ‘digital india’ is a worthwhile project per se, it can only be a partial answer to what needs to be done in this vast and yet underdeveloped country.",0.09593807977736553,modi ’ unrealistic american dreams,"least one dimension distance narendra modi jawaharlal nehru great all. speak fondness bandgala >penchant world travel. day passes

the consumption space such as e-commerce and not in manufacturing, says a new study., stating that the recent surge in fdi inflows may not give any boost to the government’s ambitious ‘make in india’ campaign, the latest research report of leading brokerage firm emkay global said, it is the ‘net fdi’ that has come down in case of china due to higher investments abroad., “the recent media hype over india surpassing china and us in fdi inflows, is supposedly considered an affirmation of the success of ‘make in india’. however, disaggregated data suggests that fdi flows have centred on exploiting domestic consumption, (and) rather than stimulating domestic manufacturing it is likely to have catalysed imports,” it said., the report further said that the gross fdi inflows to china far exceeded india by 3.6 times and china’s lower net fdi is due to higher investments abroad., “it will be premature to extrapolate the recent upsurge in fdi inflows as proof of revival in the investment cycle in india,” it added., in full year 2014, india ranked fifth after china, the us, the uk and mexico. the ‘make in india’ twitter handle also used this data to project evidence of success of this initiative., “it is indeed true that there has been an increase in fdi inflows (including green field and cross border m&a) into india in the hope of a turnaround in growth outlook, and this bodes well for the external sector to withstand potential bop (balance of payment) volatility arising from potential decline in global excess liquidity.” it said., “however, we believe it will be premature to extrapolate the recent upsurge in fdi as concrete proof of a revival in the investment cycle or aiding the objective of ‘make in india’ campaign. further, the disaggregated data on fdi inflow and outflow (greenfield and cross border m&a) indicates a much different picture compared to the general perception,” it said., emkay further said that in contrast to india’s over indulgence with fdi flows to resuscitate domestic investment cycle, global trends since 2007 show a consistent decline in the relevance of fdi and other external flows in funding investments., the share of fdi to world gross fixed capital formation (including fdi) has declined from its peak of 14 per cent in 2007 to 9 per cent., in india, it has declined from 11 per cent to 5 per cent., it further said that the global fdi activities (inflows and outflows) have slowed recently, particularly in developed economies, even as emerging markets, particularly china and hong kong, have remained resilient., as an investing country, us has seen a sizeable decline from usd three trillion in 2013 to just usd 100 billion in 2014., net fdi flows into china averaged about usd 1 billion for the 12 months ending august 2015, much lower than usd 2.9 billion for india., “while truncated data like these may have prompted some to conclude that india trumped china, if we consider only the inflows, china has consistently maintained gross inflows of about 3.6 times that of india.”, “importantly, china has been growing its investments abroad over the past several years, growing at 27-30 per cent since 2009, possibly diversifying fixed investments across other parts of the world,” the emkay study said., it further said that the rising fdi targets domestic demand rather than supporting ‘make in india’., “likewise, conventional manufacturing/investment oriented sectors such as metals, power, oil and gas have seen muted flows. fdi investment in the automobile sector is mostly aimed at targeting domestic demand,” it added.",0.05093112593112594,fdi spurt aligned spirit ‘make india ’ : study,"india remains far behind china terms ‘gross fdi inflows ’ despite recent spurt funds largely coming

2015-10-25,“insurance is still considered an expense rather than a necessity”,"sketch: l.balamurugan , as general insurance industry is in a nascent stage in india, many foreign players are looking for opportunities to expand their operations in the country. k.g. krishnamoorthy rao, managing director and chief executive officer, future generali india insurance company spoke to the hindu on various issues, including awareness campaigns of the general insurance industry for retail consumers and the launch of a cyber-insurance product. excerpts:, with the increase in the fdi cap to 49 per cent, are you expecting generali group to increase their stake in your company?, generali is quite bullish on asia and considers india as an important market. the shareholders are in discussion about the stake increase. however, we are still awaiting the final guidelines from the regulator irdai. they are to clarify the finer details of aspects like management control etc. and once that is done, we believe that the shareholders will take the discussion forward., insurance penetration has always been a concern and is expected to get a boost from social security schemes. how are you planning to deepen the penetration of products?, first and foremost, people need to be aware of the significance of insurance products. unfortunately in india, insurance is still considered as an expense rather than a necessity to secure financial stability. but an adequate insurance cover can protect you from a financial loss caused by a crisis situation. to aid in creating awareness, general insurance council had launched a series of tv commercials to educate people about the need for insurance products such as home insurance, health insurance etc. also the insurance companies are planning to introduce insurance awareness programmes in different segments., we conduct region specific insurance awareness activities as per the need of the consumers in that area. for instance, in earthquake/flood prone areas, we organise camps explaining people of the adverse effects of natural calamities and how an insurance cover can protect them from losses arising due to such calamities. we plan to associate with educational institutes across cities to generate interest and create awareness about insurance among students to make the future generation understand the need of such products., in rural market, we are trying to tie-up with ngos and micro finance institutions to educate consumers on products suitable for them like health insurance, rural insurance etc. the initiatives have to be continued for a long time in order to achieve the desired outcome for insurance penetration. the insurance schemes announced by government will certainly help in creating more awareness about insurance and will help insurance companies sell other insurance products especially in rural areas., even after the entry of private players, public sector general insurers are still dominating the sector. what are the plans to widen your market share?, general insurance sector is cluttered with 28 companies and being a second generation entrant poses a tough challenge to account for a larger market share. however, we are ramping up our distribution channels. we plan to add 2,000 new agents by the end of this fiscal to boost the existing agency network of 6,000 agents. we are also firming up our bancassurance channel. we are in talks with more private and public banks to push our products. especially the licensing of new payment banks and small banks gives us a huge opportunity to make the most of this channel. also we are looking forward to an open architecture model in bancassurance, which will help us in creating more partnerships with banks. we believe that by increasing the size of the market through deeper penetration, every player can garner more insurance premium., are there any products in the pipeline? do you expect to witness an upsurge in the awareness of hni specific insurance products?, there are few products in the filing and approval stage. we are planning to come out with a comprehensive health cover for consumers. also we are looking at a cyber-insurance product as data protection has become the need of the hour for corporate india these days. we believe that we need to have products catering to the needs of different customer segments. hni products may not account for higher volume but may have higher ticket size., how do you see the potential for online products?, online policy buying is gradually becoming popular in our country. today consumers are pressed for time and hence it becomes more convenient for them to buy a policy online. furthermore, the millennials will form the major base of our customers in future. they are a tech-savvy generation that prefers to do things at the click of the mouse. we definitely foresee a surge in online policy buying and in the next five years this may occupy significant percentage of total insurance sales pie., what are future generali india’s growth plans for this financial year and next five years?, we are looking at 25 per cent growth this year with a focus on retail channel. the growth is expected from diverse segments, especially motor insurance, retail health and personal accident portfolio. going forward, retail will account for nearly 70 per cent of our business from current 65 per cent. by 2020, we want to see ourselves as a top retail player in the general insurance sector., product wise, our focus will be to grow profitable segments of business in order to ensure the equilibrium of our bottom-line. these would include marine cargo, liability insurance, individual health and personal accident policy. another major thrust this year will be on the rural insurance portfolio. with the rapidly changing landscape of the rural economy along with heightened awareness about financial inclusion owing to the current government’s schemes, this is an area that we would like to tap. we plan to drive the sale of our policies ranging from micro-insurance products to standard personal line products., there are talks about india vision 2020. what changes do you expect to see in the industry by the year 2020?, we believe that by 2020, the penetration of general insurance should exceed one per cent of gdp. we hope that the market will become more stable with players resorting to pricing driven by underwriting considerations. this will lead to healthy development of the general insurance market., the usual perception is that claims are rejected on the ground of non-inclusion. however, the claims ratio numbers say a different story. what is your take on this and what is future generali india doing to resolve this issue?, that is a wrong impression of the industry. rather the actual rejection of claims is minuscule. if you take the example of health insurance, the problem in many cases is pre-existing diseases not being disclosed at the time of taking the policy. or the buyer has not understood some clauses like the ones on co-payment or sub-limits for expenses. in many other cases, the fine print hasn’t been read by the insured, which causes disappointment while making claims., globally, generali’s strategy has been to provide ‘simple and smart’ insurance solutions and we too are working towards making our policy wordings as simple as possible.",0.0826885740522104,“insurance still considered expense rather necessity ”,"sketch : l.balamurugan , general insurance industry nascent stage india , many foreign players looking opportunities expand operations country. k.g. krishnamoorthy rao , managing director chief executive officer , future generali india insurance company spoke hindu various issues , including awareness campaigns general insurance industry retail consumers launch cyber-insurance product. excerpts : , increase fdi cap 49 per cent , expecting generali group increase stake company?

2015-11-14,poll outcomes will not hit reforms: nirmala sitharaman,"17th,may-2015-siliguri-union minister for commerce and industry, smt nirmala sitharaman meet the press in siliguri on sunday.during visit tea garden problams.photo: sanjay sah | photo credit: sanjay sah , the nda government’s latest move to liberalise the foreign investment regime is part of an ongoing process and such economic reforms will continue irrespective of any adverse state-level poll outcomes for the alliance or the bjp in the future., stating this, commerce and industry minister nirmala sitharaman, in an interaction with the hindu’s arun s, said the fdi reforms were not a public relations exercise to counter the nda’s recent drubbing in bihar polls. she said it was also not an attempt to help prime minister narendra modi in reassuring investors in the west that his government will not go back on the promise to roll out reforms even if the bjp/nda suffers assembly-level electoral setbacks., in what it said was a ‘diwali gift’ for investors and the public, the nda government – just two days after bihar poll results -- announced its ‘biggest bang’ foreign investment policy reforms with an aim to boost investment and job creation in 15 sectors such as defence, banking, construction and single-brand retail. the decision incidentally came on the eve of modi’s departure to the uk and later to attend the g20 meeting in turkey., to win over critics such as labour unions and farmers’ unions, the government will hold talks with them before getting the fdi reforms’ decision formally cleared by the union cabinet as per due process within a month, sitharaman said. (edited excerpts)., q: was the surprise announcement (of the fdi policy reforms) meant for a positive narrative after the terrible defeat in bihar?, a: the poll results were out on november eight and the fdi decision was announced on the 10th. so even if you assume it was done because of bihar elections, it is practically impossible to work on so many decisions in such less time. the fact remains that not one or two elections, virtually nothing in the last one year has stopped us from doing what we had committed ourselves to. this government is committed to bringing in reforms and we are therefore going on with it., so such reforms will keep happening. it has been done, is done, and will be done, after taking inputs from all stakeholders. only a few months ago we came out with one similar set of decisions, including in defence, to liberalise the fdi regime., the recent decisions on 15 sectors will have a bearing on 30-odd activities, and will have a major impact on the economy. sectors like construction were desperate for funds for a long time. you and i were waiting for our flats because projects were not getting completed. so such sectors which have a potential for generating more employment will be benefited., also, last year’s fdi data showed that fdi into india grew by around 40% when in the world over, such inflows saw a drop of 16%. so fdi inflows are growing at a fairly healthy rate in india., following these kind of decisions to liberalise the fdi regime, there will be more discerning investment wanting to come into the country. also the recent decision to remove the distinction between fdi and portfolio investment and to have a composite cap allowing for complete fungibility is going to help attract more inflows., q: are there any more formalities to be completed to make the announcement effective?, a: the prime minister has already given his approval for the decision. such decisions are allowed as per the government’s transaction of business rules. but, according to those rules, within a month of such a decision, we have to go back to the union cabinet and get it approved. we are ready with the cabinet note., q: the seniors in bjp had criticised the party leadership for the bihar polls drubbing. is the party united on its stance on economic policies?, a: a lot of discussions and debates happen in our party. isn’t it good to have a democratically run party rather than a dynastic one? so obviously discussions do happen and they are for the good. it is just that some times they come out in the open, some times they don’t., q: a few months ago, when the government took the decision to introduce the composite cap policy on foreign investment, you had said the banking sector was kept out of it because the government did not want ‘fly by night’operators or quick money coming in and going out of the sector. but within a few months, the government has now reversed this stand in the latest fdi policy changes. what is the reason?, a: we have allowed time to pass. and in the meantime, we received inputs from the sector which gave us enough confidence that we can now open it up further. we had wide-ranging consultations including with the reserve bank of india and inputs were taken to look at the possibilities of risks and challenges., q: farmers’ unions and labour unions have criticised the move to liberalise the fdi regime. there is also a possibility of protests from labourers in the plantation sector, which has now been opened up further. do you have any plans to take their suggestions on board?, a: we are willing to speak and engage with any number of people on these decisions. in fact, this evening there is a meeting (with the bharatiya mazdoor sangh). these are decisions that are taken keeping the national interest in mind. we are not going to hurt any factor of production. we are not going to hurt land or labour., these decisions were taken to get some buoyancy in sectors such as construction that are cash-starved. you and i have paid advanced money for getting one flat for ourselves. but till today that has not happened. neither are you better off, nor are the developers. do you want the projects to be completed or not? so to benefit you, me and the sector, if there is a need to open up so that money comes in, after considering all other factors, we have now eased the norms. but this is not at all meant to ask foreign investors to come in and finish off all the indian companies., q: will there be a rollback of some of these decisions following the criticism?, a: no., q: in the defence sector, foreign investment proposals in excess of 49% and upto even 100% can now be considered by the foreign investment promotion board (fipb) instead of the extant policy of getting the approval of cabinet committee on security (ccs) for them. also, some consultants say it is not compulsory to bring in state-of-the-art technology in case of proposals over 49%. is this true?, a: first of all, defence and home ministries are represented in fipb. they take care of all the security and technology related issues. we have done away with the role of ccs for the sake of ease of doing business. we do not want companies to get these clearances twice, one from the fipb and then by the ccs., besides, we have also said that in cases of infusion of fresh foreign investment within the permitted automatic route level, resulting in change in ownership pattern or transfer of stake by the existing investor to a new foreign investor, government approval will be needed. this is applicable to companies which have already obtained licences., also, the condition -- that foreign investments above 49% will be considered on a case-to-case basis and only where investment is to result in access to state-of-art technology -- stands in the new policy too even in cases of such investments upto 100%., q: the policy reform includes several changes in the single brand retail trade (sbrt) space. will the government slowly start encouraging foreign investment in the multi brand sector too?, a: in the review of fdi policy conditionalities for single brand retailing, we are talking about indian manufacturers, who are by definition those who produce at least 70% of their products within india and who can source the upto 30% of their products from those who manufacture in india. in other words, everything that this indian manufacturer is dealing with is ‘made in india’. the finance minister had in his budget speech that such manufacturers will be allowed to sell his wares even through e-commerce. what we have done here is to allow this indian manufacturer to sell its own branded products in any manner, wholesale, retail and including through e-commerce platforms.",0.06635044642857144,poll outcomes hit reforms : nirmala sitharaman,"17th , may-2015-siliguri-union minister commerce industry , smt nirmala sitharaman meet press siliguri sunday.during visit tea garden problams.photo : sanjay sah &#124; photo credit : sanjay sah , nda government ’ latest move liberalise foreign investment regime part ongoing process economic reforms continue irrespective adverse state-level poll outcomes alliance bjp future. , stating , commerce industry minister nirmala sitharaman , interaction hindu ’ arun , said fdi reforms public relations exercise counter nda ’ recent drubbing bihar polls. said also attempt help prime minister narendra modi reassuring investors west government go back promise roll reforms even bjp/nda suffers assembly-level electoral setbacks. , said ‘diwali gift ’ investors public , nda government – two days bihar poll results -- announced ‘biggest bang ’ foreign investment policy reforms aim boost investment job creation 15 sectors defence , banking , construction single-brand retail. decision incidentally came eve modi ’ departure uk later attend g20 meeting turkey. , win critics labour unions farmers ’ unions , government hold talks getting fdi reforms ’ decision formally cleared union cabinet per due process within month , sitharaman said.

2015-11-17,let’s be realistic on fdi,"“a vast majority of investment in the construction sector is by private equity investors and indians bringing back black money in some form.” picture shows a construction site at manali, an industrial area in chennai. photo: s.r. raghunathan , in yet another significant move to attract foreign direct investment (fdi), the >government has opened the door wider in several major sectors of the indian economy, through what it calls “path-breaking” amendments in the extant fdi policy. these amendments can be clubbed into three categories: a “radical change” in the fdi regime in the construction sector; an increase in the threshold of foreign participation (the so-called sectoral caps) in several key sectors, including defence, broadcasting, private sector banks, non-scheduled air transport service, ground-handling services, and credit information companies; and simplification of the procedures for foreign participation in a number of sectors., fdi from developed countriesfirst, globally, fdi flows of all hues have not been growing, especially from the developed countries. the reality is that the developed countries are reaping the benefits of their past investments. real outflows from them are far less than what the aggregates suggest. reinvested earnings (profits generated and retained in host countries) are bolstering the reported fdi flows. according to the united nations conference on trade and development (unctad), the share of reinvested earnings is reported to have accounted for as much as four-fifths of total outflows in 2014 for select developed countries. a mere 10 per cent of total inflows were accounted for by direct equity flows, with loans making up for the rest. obviously, further opening up by india cannot help attract more fdi that would not have come otherwise. even if some additional inflows come in, they would soon be more than offset by outflows., another important factor is the costs associated with fdi, especially the servicing burden and crowding out of domestic investment. developing countries like india have reached out to fdi not merely because of the capital they need, but more importantly, for the technologies to make their entities more competitive. however, experience shows that while developing countries have not been able to acquire the technologies they need, they have had to make a variety of payments “for use of intellectual property”. in fact, for india, the servicing burden of fdi in terms of repatriations, dividend payments and payments for use of intellectual property is now showing up prominently. about half of the inflows into india during the past six years were balanced by outflows. what are reported as payments for technology could, in fact, be disguised dividends which deny the exchequer and the public shareholders their due. foreign companies which did not pay dividends for many years are happily sending remittances abroad on account of royalty payments, including those for the use proprietary brand names., why enhance sectoral caps?one of the reasons the government gives for enhancing sectoral caps is that of ‘fragmented ownership issues’. the reality is somewhat different. during the decade 2004-05 to 2013-14, foreign investors in the manufacturing sector have consolidated their position: a majority of the companies which received what may be termed as ‘real fdi’ (as distinct from the funds being brought by nris, private equity funds, and so on) are either wholly foreign-owned or have sole control. further, a majority of such investments is utilised in displacing domestic entrepreneurs/investors instead of adding to production capabilities. india has lost many home-grown industry leaders and potential winners through takeovers by foreign investors. the domination by foreign investors backed by huge financial resources at their disposal is proving to be inimical to the emergence and survival of domestic enterprises. fdi should add to the national productive capacities instead of becoming a threat to existing/emerging alternatives due to their superior financial strength., there was a special mention in the new policy announcement about the construction sector and the need to build 50 million houses for poor. this once again reveals that not much thought has been given to the nature of foreign investment that the sector has attracted so far. a vast majority of investment in this sector is by private equity investors and indians bringing back (black) money in one form or the other. the forms of investment that the construction sector has attracted raised several pertinent questions. will private equity investors, who seek multiple returns, and returning indians invest in housing for the poor, or in townships for the rich and the upper middle class and commercial complexes? when the private equity investors encash their investments, what would be the net outflow? in this context, it should be pointed out that disinvestments/repatriations were more than a fourth of the total equity inflows during 2009-10 to 2014-15.",0.08047170028553005,let ’ realistic fdi,"“a vast majority investment construction sector private equity investors indians bringing back black money form. ” picture shows construction site manali , industrial area chennai. photo : s.r. raghunathan , yet another significant move attract foreign direct investment ( fdi ) , >government opened door wider several major sectors indian economy , calls “path-breaking ” amendments extant fdi policy. amendments clubbed three categories : “radical change ” fdi regime construction sector ; increase threshold foreign participation ( so-called sectoral caps ) several key sectors , including defence , broadcasting , private sector banks , non-scheduled air transport service , ground-handling services , credit information companies ; simplification procedures foreign participation number sectors. , fdi developed countriesfirst , globally , fdi flows hues growing , especially developed countries. reality developed countries reaping benefits past investments. real outflows far less aggregates suggest. reinvested earnings ( profits generated retained host countries ) bolstering reported fdi flows. according united nations conference trade development ( unctad ) , share reinvested earnings reported accounted much four-fifths total outflows 2014 select developed countries. mere 10 per cent total inflows accounted direct equity flows , loans making rest. obviously , opening india cannot help attract fdi would come otherwise. even additional inflows come , would soon offset outflows. , another important factor costs associated fdi , especially servicing burden crowding domestic investment. developing countries like india reached fdi merely capital need , importantly , technologies make entities competitive. however , experience shows developing countries able acquire technologies need , make variety payments “for use intellectual property ” . fact , india , servicing burden fdi terms repatriations , dividend payments payments use intellectual property showing prominently. half inflows india past six years balanced outflows. reported payments technology could , fact , disguised dividends deny exchequer public shareholders due. foreign companies pay dividends many years happily sending remittances abroad account royalty payments , including use proprietary brand names. , enhance sectoral caps?one reasons government gives enhancing sectoral caps ‘fragmented ownership issues ’ . reality somewhat different. decade 2004-05 2013-14 , foreign investors manufacturing sector consolidated position : majority companies received may termed ‘real fdi ’ ( distinct funds brought nris , private equity funds , ) either wholly foreign-owned sole control. , majority investments utilised displacing domestic entrepreneurs/investors instead adding production capabilities. india lost many home-grown industry leaders potential winners takeovers foreign investors. domination foreign investors backed huge financial resources disposal proving inimical emergence survival domestic enterprises. fdi add national productive capacities instead becoming threat existing/emerging alternatives due superior financial strength. , special mention new policy announcement construction sector need build 50 million houses poor. reveals much thought given nature foreign investment sector attracted far. vast majority investment sector private equity investors indians bringing back ( black ) money one form other. forms investment construction sector attracted raised several pertinent questions. private equity investors , seek multiple returns , returning indians invest housing poor , townships rich upper middle class commercial complexes ?

2015-11-22,investors fret over inordinate delay in listing stock exchanges,"investors have been asking to expedite the listing of exchanges to adhere to global best practices. photo: paul noronha , the inordinate delay in listing of stock exchanges is worrying investors who say the securities and exchange board of india (sebi), the capital market regulator, should not delay the process any further as it is creating uncertainty and excuses for some exchanges not to list., the oldest stock exchange, bse, has already applied and is waiting for the regulator to approve its application. but the national stock exchange’s management is yet to decide on it. mcx, a commodity exchange, is the only listed exchange in the country., as the mcx is a listed entity, “not providing the same benefits to bse and nse would be unfair, especially given the fact that bse filed its application for listing more than two years ago,” said pratibha jain, partner, nishit desai associates, a leading law firm. however, sebi clearly allows the listing of stock exchanges on other exchanges under the securities contracts (regulation) (stock exchanges and clearing corporations) regulations, 2012., the main reason for listing is that there is need for better governance, transparency and accountability from the management of the two exchanges. secondly, kania committee, in its report in 2003 on corporatisation and demutualisation, suggested listing of stock exchanges as the next big step post demutualisation (among other things). compulsory corporatisation and demutualisation of stock exchanges was mandated by sebi, and currently all the stock exchanges have a demutualised set up in india., foreign investors had also invested to support this corporatisation and demutualisation of stock exchanges with the implicit understanding that the two exchanges would be listed in the near future and their investment will receive a fair valuation., hence, on the one hand while the government is opening up fdi and creating new investment opportunities, investors are on the other hand unable to exit from 5-8 year old investments they made into the exchanges., last month, 17 foreign investors in the nse and the bse wrote to the finance minister, conveying their dismay over the whole affair. together, they have 31.12 per cent and 25.30 per cent of the shareholding in nse and bse respectively, which translates into approximately rs. 10,400 crore and $300 million respectively. all this money is stuck and cannot be further invested into other sectors., they wrote: “in the evolutionary process of any stock exchange, ‘listing’ is the next logical step after demutualisation. majority of the stock exchanges around the world got listed within a year from their demutualisation. many exchanges in the emerging markets have listed (e.g., moscow exchange, warsaw stock exchange, bovespa) with the rationale of (a) improving transparency and governance of the listing platform, (b) completing a major milestone for the development of the country’s capital markets amidst the privatisation drive by the governments, and (c) providing liquidity to existing shareholders.”, “all investors, be it private equity or public sector undertakings, have been asking the exchanges to expedite the listing of exchanges to adhere to global best practices and increase transparency. bse has passed a resolution at its annual general meeting (agm), to proceed with the listing and has already approached sebi for approval. the ball is now in sebi’s court,” said anil khatod, senior managing director, argonaut private equity., the demand for listing of nse and bse precedes the merger of the erstwhile commodity market regulator, forward markets commission (fmc), with sebi and hence that is not the reason. according to mr. khatod, chairman of sebi, u.k. sinha had said in april 2015, that the regulator would decide whether to list bourses in six months, after completion of the merger of the commodities market regulator with capital market regulator that will enable exchanges to offer securities and commodities trading on a single platform. fmc was merged with sebi in end-september 2015., however, investors believe that there has been no forward movement since the merger. the regulator has to step in and accept the bse application to list so that the exchanges, especially nse, can no longer use regulation and regulator as an excuse.",0.06029378607503608,investors fret inordinate delay listing stock exchanges,"investors asking expedite listing

2015-11-23,some thoughts on the statement issued by 46 signatories against so-called leftist historians,"i take issue here with a few of the 7-point statement issued by “46 academics” against “leftist historians”, the full text of which was published by the hindu (“>full text of statement issued by 46 academics against ""leftist"" historians”, updated: november 18, 2015 03:16 ist ) i quote verbatim (in italics, including the numerical sequence) of the points made in that statement and and follow them with my response to each., “2. a near-complete erasure of india’s knowledge systems in every field —philosophical, linguistic, literary, scientific, medical, technological or artistic — and a general underemphasis of india’s important contributions to other cultures and civilizations . in this, the leftist school has been a faithful inheritor of colonial historiography, except that it no longer has the excuse of ignorance. yet it claims to provide an accurate and “scientific” portrayal of india!”, in fact, it is the other way round. most of the historians whom the signatories obviously make reference to without naming them, have constantly (in most of their writings) critiqued the colonial legacy of branding indian histories within neatly defined categories of “hindu”, “muslim” and “british” periods. calling them “inheritors” of the colonial historiography should be seen best as a joke. a wide range of scholarship over last many years on archaeology, numismatics, iconography, architecture, music and dance and literature have certainly not underplayed any of these aspects of histories of india: in fact there have been both celebratory and critical studies, so there is no generalised, singular history on any of these aspects, and should not be. these did not come from the stable of ‘right-ist’ historians. as far as india’s contribution to other civilisations and cultures goes, every nation in this world can lay claims to having given something to others. historically speaking, ideas have travelled with people and we cannot say exactly who gave what to whom, but larger political influences and historical linkages between what are today nation-states but were earlier empires, republics and chieftainships, played a role in these exchanges. who can stake a claim to sufi ideas today, for instance? and if we speak of mathematics and science, can we ignore the contributions of the persian or arab world or the world of the native americans of the past to these?, “3. a denial of the continuity and originality of india’s hindu-buddhist-jain-sikh culture, ignoring the work of generations of indian and western indologists. hindu identity, especially, has been a pet aversion of this school, which has variously portrayed it as being disconnected from vedic antecedents, irrational, superstitious, regressive, barbaric — ultimately “imagined” and, by implication, illegitimate.”, there was no ‘continuity’ between hindu, buddhist, jaina, sikh culture, as if it was a seamless flow of history without contestation, revolt, ruptures, and contradictions of time, ideas and influences. the buddha and mahavira, in fact, founded an idea against the very idea of god or god-hood and caste, and stressed on human action. the charavakas went a step further in propounding a materialist school of thought. the jaina and buddhist religions were counters (expressly so) to the vedic ritualistic religious ethic and the idea of non-violence was a counter to the violence and extreme consumption (of what would today be called ‘natural resources’) inherent in the offering of sacrifices. the buddhist and jaina texts are pretty specific about their points of difference with the vedic-sanskritic theistic religions. guru nanak included various streams of thought (including sufi) and ideas within his idea of god. at the other end, certainly indian history is larger than a narrowly defined sanskritic-vedic- hindu history. a wide range of scholarship (in india and abroad) has emerged on understanding communities marginalised through time and history in india. if the jainas and buddhists were to be questioned or engaged with in true seriousness of scholarly engagement, they will tell you stories of their marginalisation and ‘erasure’ by the dominant ‘hindu’ tradition. in fact, you have evidence of legal battles from the colonial times by communities such as the jainas who did not wish to be categorised as hindu (and this information comes from members of the tamil jaina community as it does from records of court cases even in the colonial period)., on the other hand, there is no universal monolithic ‘hindu’ identity, and these are things you would only understand if you travel within the country and engage with diversities that face you. one of the discourses that lends substantiation to this is the one on many ramayanas, which in fact, acknowledged the sheer diversity within the so-called hindu tradition, which gave so many interpretations to an epic, each different from the other, and each celebrated. if the jaina ramayana were recited today, it would surely cause a violent uproar. as for the dalit discourse, there are several dalit movements across the country who will swear against the imposition of a singular hindu tradition and culture complex on them, their food culture and their gods and goddesses. we all know as to who ultimately became the largest in numbers, and perhaps we should also wonder as to whether the population also reveals something as to why some are minoritised and some become the majority; is the dominant a mere coincidence of history or is it constructed consciously, politically and economically? many tribal communities in india actually oppose the destruction of their homes and livelihoods by so-called ‘development’ projects. the gonds in fact have filed legal petitions to include their gondi religion as a separate religion, distinct from the ‘hindu’. whose majority history and economics is imposed on whom is a hard fact which a plain reading of government statistics can prove. the destruction of tribal homes and massacre of dalit homes is a fact, as well. tomorrow, writing this history will also be considered a crime. india’s histories (for there are several histories as there are communities who have indeed not been represented by mainstream histories) have also been violent, exclusivist, and many things else than simply glorious, golden and all-embracing. in fact, the golden, all embracing, glorious periods in human histories (not india’s alone) may be fewer than the violent, hegemonising ones. it depends on what our questions to our histories are and whose histories are we to write – ones of the victors or the vanquished or the oppressed and silenced and oblivious to the mainstream., “4. a refusal to acknowledge the well-documented darker chapters of indian history, in particular the brutality of many muslim rulers and their numerous buddhist, jain, hindu and occasionally christian and muslim victims (ironically, some of these tyrants are glorified today); the brutal intolerance of the church in goa, kerala and puducherry; and the state-engineered economic and cultural impoverishment of india under the british rule. while history worldwide has wisely called for millions of nameless victims to be remembered, indian victims have had to suffer a second death, that of oblivion, and often even derision.”, the british colonial period has in fact been critiqued by most historians targetted in this statement. british colonial regime’s hegemonising language, destroying forests, rivers, communities (most importantly tribal communities) has been written about far more by historians in the recent past than any other history. we also know for a fact that the indian state’s idea of ‘development’ in fact continued many of the oppressive policies from the british (we even continue to have sedition laws, for instance) and not even bjp has had any problems with these laws. colonial perceptions of rivers and forests have continued to be followed verbatim almost by the congress as much as by the bjp-nda regimes. yes, indeed, the victims who are usually not remembered (not because of the historians being targetted here as being ‘leftists”) are the manipuris who continue to battle with a draconian law called afspa; the dalits who often get killed in states like tamilnadu, haryana, maharashtra and elsewhere, muslims who are targeted and killed. tribal communities have been targetted time and again in the economic battle for resources across the country. what to speak of jaina and buddhist histories erased continuously even today, and their places of worship being converted and their religious leaders (especially digambara jaina naked monks) being ridiculed and disrespected? who has kept up the idea of india as a diverse nation and who forces a universal monolithic model to india as being only “hindu’ and nothing else is for all to see. the tamil jainas still remember their persecution by the saivite ‘bhakti’ tradition and destruction or conversion of their sacred sites into saivite ones are visible even through a cursory glance at these sites in today’s tamilnadu. the ‘muslim” ruler as a “tyrant” is a false notion propagated by the rss-vhp-bjp combine, endorsed by the signatories of this statement. there is no universal “muslim” as there was no singular kind of muslim ruler. here there is a definite erasure of histories of communities such as the arab traders (not kings or emperors) who came into kerala, stayed behind, intermarried and lived peacefully with the local communities. not all muslims came to conquer india. even among rulers there have been muslim rulers who contributed to the larger tradition of indian music, architecture and literature. the signatories do not seem to be aware of the regional cultural diversity among muslims. speaking of the “intolerant” church, in fact, there were several attacks on churches and pastors carried out by extreme elements of the larger ‘hindutva’ bandwagon. this writer had recorded (in 2014) a statement from some arrested in telangana who openly claimed that they had done so to teach a lesson to the christian priests (see http://www.vikalp.ind.in/2014/02/silent-attacks-hate-campaign-against.html). staines and his children were burnt alive in odisha many years ago and christian nuns were raped in up many years ago. who raped them and who murdered them? what about these pages of our histories? state-engineered impoverishment of people through displacement is happening also under the present bjp rule (of course being a consolidation and expansion of what began with the congress-led upa) with schemes to increase fdi in coal mining, retail, easing of land acquisition rules and speaking of manufacturing hubs. imperialism of one kind may have ended but economic imperialism / bullying as a concept is yet to go., “5. a neglect of tribal histories: for all its claims to give a voice to “marginalized” or “oppressed” sections of indian society, the leftist school has hardly allowed a space to india’s tribal communities and the rich contributions of their tribal belief systems and heritage. when it has condescended to take notice, it has generally been to project hindu culture and faith traditions as inimical to tribal cultures and beliefs, whereas in reality the latter have much more in common with the former than with the religions imposed on them through militant conversions.”, suddenly the tribal communities and their histories are invoked! tribal histories in fact were brought to the mainstream not by rss-bjp but to a large extent by the subaltern school of historians followed by several others (not part of the right). while there is no universal ‘tribal’ history nor should there be any attempt to build one, considering the diversity in social, economic and political situations of tribal communities in india (the communities in chhattisgarh or telangana or andhra pradesh cannot be equated with those in manipur, meghalaya, or mizoram), yet, by and large their cultures are unique and not part of the hindu mainstream dominant culture. remarriage, elopement, consuming beef, pork, etc, freedom to choose their partners, egalitarian ethos are some of the cultural aspects found in some tribal communities (as documented and recorded) even today, which would never be accepted by the right at any time. in fact, the attack on their cultures and thereby histories are coming from the present discourse on food, ban on eating beef, and may be tomorrow there will be ban on several other things that are considered sacrilege to the mainstream dominant ‘hindu’ culture. incidentally, the earliest political effort to understand and mobilise the strength of tribal communities happened – whether correctly or insufficiently – from the left in india (from the time of the freedom movement), for which records are available. alluri sitaramaraju, for instance, was neither a right-wing historian nor politician. the rampa revolt was hardly a right wing enterprise. shaheed bhagat singh was influenced / inspired not by hindutva but by the marxist tradition and that is a part of history that cannot be negated unless the records are burnt. “long live revolution” and “down with imperialism” were some of the words in the statement of bhagat singh before the bench at the lahore high court.",0.0647987542902797,thoughts statement issued 46 signatories so-called leftist historians,"take issue 7-point statement issued “46 academics ” “leftist historians ” , full text published hindu ( “>full text statement issued 46 academics "" leftist "" historians ” , updated : november 18 , 2015 03 : 16 ist ) quote verbatim ( italics , including numerical sequence ) points made statement follow response each. , “2. near-complete erasure india ’ knowledge systems every field — philosophical , linguistic , literary , scientific , medical , technological artistic — general underemphasis india ’ important contributions cultures civilizations . , leftist school faithful inheritor colonial historiography , except longer excuse ignorance. yet claims provide accurate “scientific ” portrayal india ! ” , fact , way round. historians signatories obviously make reference without naming , constantly ( writings ) critiqued colonial legacy branding indian histories within neatly defined categories “hindu ” , “muslim ” “british ” periods. calling “inheritors ” colonial historiography seen best joke. wide range scholarship last many years archaeology , numismatics , iconography , architecture , music dance literature certainly underplayed aspects histories india : fact celebratory critical studies , generalised , singular history aspects , be. come stable ‘right-ist ’ historians. far india ’ contribution civilisations cultures goes , every nation world lay claims given something others. historically speaking , ideas travelled people cannot say exactly gave , larger political influences historical linkages today nation-states earlier empires , republics chieftainships , played role exchanges. stake claim sufi ideas today , instance ?

2015-12-11,delivering on the digital promise,"""much of growth in trade will be spurred by digital india and the robust technology industry.” picture shows a digital india banner in new delhi. photo: sandeep saxena , we are all guilty of judging the narendra modi government’s success on whether it can get major legislative reforms passed through parliament. the international community, media, and think tanks have obsessed over the goods and services tax (gst) bill, land acquisition bill, and labour law reforms. the focus on big-ticket items fuelled the coverage of the bihar elections. it was considered a bellwether state for the bjp and the prime minister’s future. after all, the thinking went, “if you can’t win bihar, you can’t secure a majority in the rajya sabha, and then you can’t pass any major economic reforms over the objections of the opposition”., the problem with the continued focus on gst and these other bills is that it ignores the prime minister’s flagship programme — digital india — which can be implemented in large part without parliamentary assent., the prime minister has rightfully spent significant political capital on his digital india initiative. he has put out press releases, done roll-out events, and become the first indian prime minister in over three decades to tour silicon valley. while visiting the headquarters of google, tesla, and facebook, he made the case that technology, innovation, and his digital india programme should serve as the centrepiece of u.s.-india relations. we couldn’t agree more., in the last decade, the u.s. and india have worked hand in hand to nearly triple annual bilateral trade, which currently stands at $102 billion. this is promising, but we are a long way from achieving the jointly stated goal of $500 billion. much of tomorrow’s growth in trade will be spurred by digital india and the robust technology industry., a potential game changerat its heart, digital india is an ambitious vision that has the potential to be an equaliser for indians by driving inclusive growth for the economy. digital india connects villages with broadband. it brings better, more accessible, governance to the people. it encompasses the entire gamut of prime minister modi’s other initiatives — india’s national financial inclusion plan that aims to connect every indian to a bank account, building 100 smart cities, and the make in india programme designed to spur local manufacturing and job creation., if the above programmes are implemented properly, india will enjoy the benefits of historic economic growth. indeed, mckinsey and co. estimated that the adoption of key technologies and policies across sectors spurred by the digital india initiative could help boost india’s gross domestic product (gdp) by $550 billion, propelling its gdp to $1 trillion by 2025., big numbers are tantalising, but they must be paired with sound policy — the foundation on which innovation, economic growth, and social progress is built., the crown jewel in the digital india programme lies in the private sector’s ability to innovate new technologies that enhance and modernise the way business and civic life are carried out. for india to achieve its full potential, prime minister modi must implement digital india in collaboration with the private sector., there are three policy reforms that american enterprise desires in order to enable india to achieve these social and economic goals. again, these reforms do not require parliamentary action., first, india should vigorously pursue the expansion of broadband and it infrastructure throughout the country. eighty-five per cent of indians still don’t have access to the internet, and a majority of them live in rural india. this is far short of the near-universal access and connectivity envisaged by the digital india mission. the government is currently investing resources to improve the efficiency of india’s national optical fibre network in an effort to provide broadband across the country and erase connectivity gaps. however, there remain significant gaps in last-mile connectivity, and this is a particularly ripe area for private sector collaboration. for example, making it easier to obtain clearances to install cell phone towers is one way to deal with the connectivity problem. lifting the ban on foreign satellite operators that can provide spectrum is another. both approaches should be pursued in tandem., second, in the spirit of promoting digital india and innovation, e-commerce models should enable small- and medium-sized businesses across india to reach national and global consumers. the recent bihar loss was quickly followed by the government’s announcement to open up foreign direct investment (fdi) in a number of sectors. while these reforms were largely welcome, they did not touch business-to-consumer e-commerce. fdi in that sector remains restricted, meaning smaller indian e-commerce companies cannot seek the capital they need to grow their business and hire more employees. equally troubling, small- and medium-sized indian manufacturers, who are vital to the make in india programme, are held back by their lack of access to broader domestic and international consumer markets. accordingly, the department of industrial policy and promotion should allow at least 51 per cent fdi in e-commerce — and ultimately 100 per cent.",0.07904329004329004,delivering digital promise,""" much growth trade spurred digital india robust technology industry. ” picture shows digital india banner new delhi. photo :

2015-12-12,latest fdi reforms could hit make in india,"“the intent of this policy seems to be to encourage firms to make in india and sell it in any mode they prefer, in the context of single brand retail firms that were already allowed 100 per cent fdi, but couldn’t sell online so far , the latest changes to the country’s foreign direct investment or fdi policy could end up hurting the government’s ambition to make india a global manufacturing hub, as they have introduced an element of uncertainty over manufacturing investments where none existed before., the new fdi policy announced by the government ahead of prime minister narendra modi’s visit to the united kingdom and the g20 summit in turkey last month, entailed liberalising norms for 15 sectors, including defence, construction, civil aviation, fm radio, single brand retail, private banks and manufacturing., but the notification to effect these changes issued by the department of industrial policy and promotion on november 24, introduces the definition of what constitutes ‘manufacture’ within the purview of the fdi policy — which industry experts and representatives say could be a ‘double whammy’ for investments., defining manufacturing in the fdi policy could end up restricting foreign investments in some sectors, including the likes of electronics and hardware manufacturing. at the same time, indian firms are worried that this could open the door for competitors to make minor changes to imported goods and still call it ‘manufacture’., “indian manufacturing companies are now up in arms against this definition because they believe that under this definition, foreign companies will effect minor modifications to goods and re-label them as “made in india”, which will make similar indian goods less competitive,” akil hirani, managing partner at majmudar and partners, an international law firm told the hindu., “the government, although well-intentioned, could have done without this definition because definitions are prone to interpretations which can vary and, thereby, cause ambiguity,” mr. hirani said., the fdi policy has defined manufacture, with its grammatical variations, as a change in a non-living physical object, resulting in transformation of the object into a new and distinct article having a different name, character and use, or bringing into existence of a new and distinct thing with a different chemical composition or integral structure., the ceo of an information, communications, technology and electronics (icte) hardware company said that the definition of manufacture would lead to a lot of unnecessary litigation by the excise, service tax departments and other government agencies., manufacturing is defined differently in the excise, service tax and income tax laws. however, the definition in the fdi policy is based on the income tax law., “why have multiple definitions in the first place? and if the fdi policy must lay out what is manufacturing, it could have simply referred to the definition under the excise law where the supreme court has laid down a lot of norms on what constitutes manufacture,” said dhiraj mathur, partner (regulatory affairs) at consulting firm pwc. mr. mathur said that though this discrepancy may not impact traditional manufacturing sectors, it would be a source of confusion in some sectors, including electronics and it., “if a company assembles various computer hardware and embeds it with software, i would define it as manufacturing, but it may not be so clear as per the definition in the fdi policy,” he pointed out., in the case of a conflict between the fdi policy and excise law definitions of manufacturing, mr. mathur said that the central excise act of 1944 would prevail as it is a law passed by parliament, while the fdi policy is based on an executive decision., as per section 2 (f) of the excise law, ‘manufacture’ includes any process, incidental and ancillary to the completion of a manufactured product., the law separately specifies the goods that come under its ambit, with a separate schedule that lists goods, whose packing, labelling or alterations made to make it marketable to consumers also constitute manufacture., “with the goods and services tax regime coming in soon, why do we want to get into this hair-splitting over a new interpretation of manufacturing now?” asked the hardware company’s ceo, who did not wish to be identified owing to the sensitivity of the matter., under the new fdi policy, slitting complex films for electronic capacitors, testing, etching a surface etc. may be declared as not manufacturing, for instance, he said, stressing that the issue is being discussed among industry bodies., these fdi reforms are ‘one more proof of minimum government and maximum governance… opening up the manufacturing sector for wholesale, retail and e-commerce so that the industries are motivated to make in india and sell it to the customers here instead of importing from other countries,’ the commerce and industry ministry had said in a statement on november 10., rajat mukherjee, partner at law firm khaitan & co, said that fdi in manufacturing was always allowed at 100 per cent, barring the few sectors that were reserved in the past for small-scale industries., “the intent of this policy seems to be to encourage firms to make in india and sell it in any mode they prefer, in the context of single brand retail firms that were already allowed 100 per cent fdi, but couldn’t sell online so far,” he said., “but the definition of manufacture leaves room for problems, when taken together with the conditions imposed on indian manufacturers with branded goods,” he added., indian manufacturers can now sell their own ‘branded

2015-12-13,a cannon yet to fire - not a single big ticket proposal,"foreign firms are unwilling to transfer high-end technology unless the cap is increased to a level above 50 per cent (and perhaps significantly more), because it simply doesn't make business sense. , where does india stand on defence manufacturing and how have the government’s recent moves on easing fdi norms and ease of doing business helped the sector?, the reality on the ground, according to several senior analysts is that little has come in by way of tangible large investments and for now india is still reliant on importing military equipment to fulfil its short term needs., why is this still the case?, following on the heels of its heavy defeat in the bihar elections, the nda government moved quickly to ease fdi regulations for several key sectors including defence. the government allowed foreign investment up to 49 per cent under the automatic route, from the earlier government approval route. it also stipulated that investments exceeding 49 per cent would now be cleared by the foreign investment promotion board rather than going through the more circuitous route of the cabinet committee on security., yet, more than a year after the nda government first announced that it would increase the fdi cap in the defence sector to 49 per cent, from 26 per cent, there is still a reluctance on the part of most global majors to come in with a significant project. part of this problem is linked to an ongoing debate about whether 49 per cent is actually enough given that the limit is designed to ensure that control of the venture remains with the indian companies., from an industry perspective it's long been the opinion of several analysts that unless the fdi cap is increased to at least 74 percent things are unlikely to move on the ground., most other developed countries have recognised the fact that defence production necessarily involves a series of international collaborations. however, as india gradually opens up the sector there remains a lingering sense of mistrust among indian companies who don't want to lose control of the venture. conversely, foreign firms are unwilling to transfer high-end technology unless the cap is increased to a level above 50 per cent (and perhaps significantly more), because it simply doesn't make business sense., but is the debate about investment caps merely a superficial one that covers up some deeper issues with policy planning in defence?, amit cowshish, a former financial advisor to the ministry of defence, explained that in reality there has always been a provision to raise the cap over 49 per cent if it involved a significant transfer of high-tech technology. in september this year, a u.s. official noted that when there was 'industry anxiety over control of technology' then the fdi limit would be increased on a case-to-case basis., yet despite this clause there has not been a single big ticket proposal for investment. figures tabled in parliament in march showed that the government has got just six fdi proposals worth a paltry rs 96 crore ($15.3 million) in the defence production sector, with only two of them being for 49 percent. this was for a period of seven months and the situation hasn't really improved since. in the meantime, india's defence expenditure is expected to accelerate heavily over the next three decades, with the country expected to spend another $120 billion on arms acquisition over the next 10 years., given such a large domestic need, why have indian companies continued to be such poor suppliers and why are foreign companies still unwilling to invest given the potentially huge market., “design and development projects usually entail a long gestation period and there is an inherent risk of failure,” mr. cowshish observed. “therefore no one would run the risk of making heavy investments in such projects unless there is a guarantee of orders coming in and clarity on the exact nature of the domestic market,” he said., there is therefore a catch 22 situation where local manufacturers like bharat forge, l&t and tata require high-end technology to scale up manufacturing but there is no clarity from the mod on what exactly its requirements are. “on the mod website there is a document called the technology prospectus and capability roadmap but the targets mentioned here are vague with no idea even of what the requirements are over the next five or even fifteen years,” mr. cowshish pointed out. “and it is difficult to make out a business case from this document.” another senior industry analysts points out that india has a history of dragging its feet on defence deals. added to this is the fact now that the make in india campaign sends out mixed signals with regards to foreign investment. “there is a hesitation on the part of foreign companies because they don't know where they are going to fit in. it's clear that the mod will now prioritise indian manufacturing,” he explained. the central government is now cognizant of the fact that the majority of technology, at least for the short term, has to come in the form of off-the-shelf purchases like the rafale deal. in the long term, the plan may be to have indian companies scale up to the level of a lockheed or a boeing., but can this be done without properly addressing the issue of creating an

2016-01-11,playing games with the taxman,"according to the latest report on illicit financial flows (iffs), released last month by global financial integrity (gfi), a washington-based research and advocacy firm, $510 billion of black money flowed out of india from 2004 to 2013. that means an average annual outflow of $51 billion, or rs. 3.3 lakh crore., this is a conservative estimate. the gfi study of 2015, “illicit financial flows from developing countries: 2004-2013”, did not include or cover misinvoicing of trade in services, cash transactions, and hawala transactions. if we took into account all those, the total outflow would be much higher., unfortunately, the mainstream discourse on tax evasion (which is illegal) and tax avoidance (which is legal but could be equally abusive) in india has consistently misrepresented the problem. the emotive, and largely symbolic, promise of retrieving black money stashed abroad by the corrupt has served to distract attention away from the entities that actually account for the lion’s share of illicit capital flight: multinational enterprises (mnes). the key discursive move of separating the economic misdeed of tax-dodging from the social one of corruption has been largely bypassed, with the former conveniently lost in the sound and fury generated by the latter., to be sure, from time to time, the odd court battle over tax evasion featuring a vodafone or a nokia does make it to the headlines. but even when it does, the discourse is mostly framed in terms of marauding taxmen persecuting blameless corporates., the reality, if we go by the numbers, is often the opposite. according to the gfi report, trade misinvoicing (of goods) accounted for 83.4 per cent of the $510 billion of iffs from india. the organisation for economic cooperation and development (oecd) estimates that more than 60 per cent of global trade occurs within mnes — that is, between the subsidiaries of an mne. taken together, what these numbers indicate is a massive shifting of profits from jurisdictions with higher tax rates to those with zero or very low tax rates., as the accounting expert, prem sikka, notes in a column, an mne today is an integrated entity that coordinates the businesses of hundreds of subsidiaries spread across jurisdictions. but for tax purposes, these businesses are assumed to be separate economic activities. “so a single group of companies with 500 subsidiaries is assumed to consist of 500 independent taxable entities in diverse locations,” notes mr. sikka. “this leaves plenty of scope for profit shifting and tax games” (“oecd’s new tax proposals won’t stop companies shifting profits to tax havens”, oct. 6, 2015, the conversation)., thanks to this evasion-friendly tax regime, mnes with profits in billions of dollars enjoy an effective tax rate in the low single-digits., the most popular mechanism for shifting profits is transfer pricing. for it giants such as google or microsoft which are engaged in services, transfer pricing takes the form of a licensing fee or a royalty payment or interest paid by a subsidiary to a parent company located offshore. these payments are then treated as a cost in the jurisdiction where revenues are being generated, thereby slashing profits., transfer pricing channels a subsidiary’s profits through a cascade of companies incorporated in different jurisdictions, to eventual safety in a tax haven. google has used bermuda. amazon uses luxembourg. microsoft uses bermuda. pepsi uses mauritius. pfizer uses cayman islands. the list could be expanded to include nearly every fortune 500 company. but here’s the thing: it’s all legal., this lethal combination of transfer pricing and tax havens makes it impossible to curb illicit capital flows, even as more and more economies confront rising public debt. while the european union is estimated to be losing €1.1 trillion of income to tax-dodging every year, the bigger losers are the developing countries in africa, asia and latin america., according to the tax justice network (tjn), a research and advocacy group, as of 2010, $21-32 trillion were held in 80 ‘secrecy’ jurisdictions. its study of financial flows from 139 low- and middle-income countries from 1970 to 2010 found that “offshore earnings swamp foreign investment”. as of 2010, the elites of these 139 countries had accumulated unrecorded offshore wealth of $7.3-$9.3 trillion. this dwarfed the collective external debt of these nations, which stood at $4.08 trillion. in other words, if they could find a way to retrieve their assets stashed illegally abroad, they would be net creditors, not debtors., india is a typical case. as per the finance ministry’s data, india received $392.2 billion in fdi in the 15 years from 2000 to 2015. but we lost much more in illicit outflows: $512 billion in just the 10 years from 2004 to 2013. as the tjn report sums up, “the problem is that the assets of these countries are held by a small number of wealthy individuals while the debts are shouldered by the ordinary people of these countries through their governments.”, and the best way to make ordinary people shoulder the state’s debt burden is to tax consumption more heavily than wealth. hence, the growing importance of the goods and services tax — a hard-to-evade indirect tax that would squeeze the salaried classes and local small and medium enterprises — to make up for the billions of dollars of direct tax revenue that the state is either unable or unwilling to collect from treaty-shopping mnes., the warped tax regime within nation states is paralleled in the international arena where the dice is loaded in favour of capital-exporting nations. with global trade being dominated by mnes, it was found necessary to put in place a tax regime that ensured revenue for every country while avoiding double taxation. two model tax treaties were developed, one by the united nations, and another by the oecd., the un model favoured taxing income at the ‘source country’ — that is, wherever the income-generating economic activity took place, regardless of the residence of the enterprise’s owners. this was good for developing countries which, for years, had allowed their natural resources to be extracted by foreign capital, only to see the profits flow to offshore entities without doing much to enrich the local population., in the oecd model, residents of a country would be taxed on their worldwide income, while non-residents would be taxed only on their domestic income., not surprisingly, it is residence taxation that has become predominant in tax treaties, for it suits the mnes very well. the mnes end up paying little tax in their own residence jurisdiction, since the bulk of their revenue is generated overseas. as for the countries where they actually make their money, there too they avoid paying income tax as they are non-residents and so are not eligible to be taxed anyway. it is this discrepancy of double tax avoidance that’s been at the heart of most disputes between indian taxmen and foreign mnes., india, in its double taxation avoidance agreements, has opted for a predominantly oecd model, which means that the fdi we are manically seeking will pay very little or no tax in india on the income it generates from india. not that this isn’t already the case, but presumably, it is important reassure investors that nasty surprises like the ones thrown at nokia or vodafone won’t happen again. hence, the finance bill 2015’s much talked about place of effective management, which is essentially a residence taxation concept.",0.061796789658939186,playing games taxman,"according latest report illicit financial flows ( iffs ) , released last month

2016-01-14,what free basics did not intend to do,"illustration: satwik gade , in its aggressive campaign for free basics, couched in simplistic developmental language, facebook underestimated the political sophistication of the indian public. it must be regretting it now. the >social networking service’s reportedly rs. 100-crore campaign, through double full-page newspaper advertisements, billboards and television, appears simply to have congealed public opinion against free basics. everyone seems to be eager to discuss and write about what is wrong with free basics. when >the regulator had last called for net neutrality-related inputs, in may 2015, the opinions were relatively more divided. if they are so much more polarised today against free basics and net neutrality violations, the manner in which facebook pushed this campaign does bear some responsibility for it., facebook’s campaign may actually have ended up doing a lot of good to india, which, after all, was its professed goal. we must thank facebook for that. these benefits have been on two explicit fronts, and one more which will become apparent in some time., the internet as a right, this should make the regulator and the government think seriously about some such data entitlement for every citizen. it could also have an impact on how connectivity through the government’s national optical fibre network will be provided to the people. this network, connecting almost the whole of rural india, is expected to be in place within the next two-four years. such emerging public opinion in favour of free basic connectivity, if concretised into public policy, will be the first true expression of the internet as a right, a concept which has begun to be discussed globally., the second unintended consequence of the free basics campaign has been a groundswell of public consciousness that now sees the internet not just in pure market terms, but as a unique social phenomenon which requires special public interest regulation. the last round of net neutrality consultation was the first heave in this direction, but it was still a bit tentative and immature. it is also much easier for people to see the logic for an internet that treats all content equally, than develop a case against a free service. (remember, free service is already the dominant internet service model in application and content layers, a point which we will come to later.) that the indian public could form a considered opinion on this rather complex social and policy issue is heartening to note. it is likely to usher a new era of internet rights activism, with people claiming digital technologies as a right and not just something that the market provides on its own terms., at the many public interest discussions on this subject, people came up with ingenious analogies. one person said, “i am ready to pay the auto driver according to the distance travelled, not based on the destination that i go to.” another said, “free basics is like someone giving you cooking gas for free, but being able to decide what you will cook with it.” there is an emergence of a very sophisticated orientation as to how people see the internet in terms of its very crucial and strong role in society today, and its hidden manipulative possibilities., the cooking analogy is not a far-fetched one if one projects ahead into the emerging world of internet of things. the internet can be seen as a new neutral system of society, one that organises our lives, which can become very dangerous if its manipulative potential is not closely watched and kept in check. there will always be corporatist tendencies to place ‘control points’ on this neutral network, with various kinds of free services as the incentive, but which would lead to far greater economic and other forms of exploitation., neutrality in all layersthis brings us to the third unintended consequence of the facebook campaign. this is only being informally talked about as of now, but will break into prominence soon when other similar ‘platform abuses’ come to the fore. this is about how facebook used its monopoly social networking platform for a huge political campaign in its own favour, making and sharing lakhs (11 million, according to facebook) of template responses to the regulator’s consultation. the same platform functionality was not available to other users, who could be holding other views on the subject., the implications of such ‘platform abuse’ are not difficult to see. imagine a close election contest in the future when facebook, say, has 70 per cent of adult indians as its users. there are two main parties and, say, fdi or higher corporate taxes has become the key election issue. what if facebook does a similar campaign two weeks before the elections, taking a strong position favouring one side, reaching and ‘engaging’ its users in a manner that others cannot do using the same platform?, the question then is, if a telco cannot be allowed to provide different functionalities on its platform to different content and application-providers, how can a monopoly social networking platform be allowed to discriminate among its users in such a blatant way and with such far-reaching social consequences? it is much easier to switch between telcos today than to even find a good alternative to the facebook platform., net neutrality and ‘zero-rating’ are therefore just the first key internet regulation issues that we are facing. as the internet quickly transforms our social systems and becomes an essential element, there will soon be other kinds of ‘platform neutrality’ issues.",0.11163047335178483,free basics intend,"illustration : satwik gade , aggressive campaign free basics , couched simplistic developmental language , facebook underestimated political sophistication indian public. must regretting now. >social networking service ’ reportedly rs. 100-crore campaign , double full-page newspaper advertisements , billboards television , appears simply congealed public opinion free basics. everyone seems eager discuss write wrong free basics. >the regulator last called net neutrality-related inputs , may 2015 , opinions relatively divided. much polarised today free basics net neutrality violations , manner facebook pushed campaign bear responsibility it. , facebook ’ campaign may actually ended lot good india , , , professed goal. must thank facebook that. benefits two explicit fronts , one become apparent time. , internet right , make regulator government think seriously data entitlement every citizen. could also impact connectivity government ’ national optical fibre network provided people. network , connecting almost whole rural india , expected place within next two-four years. emerging public opinion favour free basic connectivity , concretised public policy , first true expression internet right , concept begun discussed globally. , second unintended consequence free basics campaign groundswell public consciousness sees internet pure market terms , unique social phenomenon requires special public interest regulation. last round net neutrality consultation first heave direction , still bit tentative immature. also much easier people see logic internet treats content equally , develop case free service.

2016-01-21,the hidden wealth of nations,"tax havens such as mauritius thrive parasitically, feeding on substantive economies like india. , this could be a bumper year for the ever-lucrative tax avoidance industry. the 2015 final reports of the organisation for economic co-operation and development (oecd)-led project on base erosion and profit shifting (beps) — which refer to the erosion of a nation’s tax base due to the accounting tricks of multinational enterprises (mnes) and the legal but abusive shifting out of profits to low-tax jurisdictions respectively — lays out 15 action points to curb abusive tax avoidance by mnes. as a participant of this project, india is expected to implement at least some of these measures. but can it? more pertinently, does it have the political will?, the beps project is no doubt a positive development for tax justice. if india’s recent economic history tells us anything, it is that economic growth without public investment in social infrastructure such as health care and education can do very little to better the life conditions of the majority. which is why curbing tax evasion to boost public finance is part of the united nations’ sustainable development goals (sdgs)., however, notwithstanding the beps project, mnes and their dedicated army of highly paid accountants are not about to roll over and comply. again, if past history is any indication, the cat-and-mouse game between accountants and taxmen will continue, with new loopholes being unearthed in new tax rules., empowering tax dodgersthe primary cause of concern here is the quality of india’s political leadership, which has consistently betrayed its own taxmen. all it takes — regardless of the party in power — is for the stock market to sneeze, and the indian state swoons. we’ve seen it happen time and again: the postponement of the enforcement of >general anti-avoidance rules (gaar) to 2017, and more spectacularly, on the issue of participatory notes, or p-notes., last year, the special investigation team (sit) on >black money had recommended mandatory disclosure to the regulator, as per know your customer (kyc) norms, of the identity of the final owner of p-notes. it was a sane suggestion because the bulk of p-note investments in the indian stock market were from tax havens such as cayman islands. but the markets threw a fit, with the sensex crashing by 500 points in a day. the national democratic alliance (nda) government, which had come to power promising to fight black money, promptly issued a statement assuring investors that it was in no hurry to implement the sit recommendations. given such a patchy record, what are the realistic chances of india actually clamping down on tax dodging?, let’s take, for instance, action no. 6 of the oecd’s beps report: it urges nations to curb treaty abuse by amending their double taxation avoidance agreements (dtaa) suitably. the obvious litmus test of india’s seriousness on beps is its dtaa with mauritius. by way of background, mauritius accounted for 34 per cent of india’s >fdi equity inflows from 2000 to 2015. it’s been india’s single-largest source of fdi for nearly 15 years. now, is it possible that there are so many rich businessmen in this tiny island nation with a population of just 1.2 million, all with a touching faith in india as an investment destination? if not, how do we explain an island economy with a gdp less than one-hundredth of india’s gdp supplying more than one-third of india’s fdi?, we all know the answer: mauritius is a tax haven. while not in the same league as cayman islands or bermuda, mauritius is a rising star, thanks in no small measure to india’s patriotic but tragically tax-allergic business elite. in treasure islands: tax havens and the men who stole the world, financial journalist nicholas shaxson notes how mauritius is a popular hub for what is known as “round-tripping”. he writes, “a wealthy indian, say, will send his money to mauritius, where it is dressed up in a secrecy structure, then disguised as foreign investment, before being returned to india. the sender of the money can avoid indian tax on local earnings.”, in other words, it appears that india’s biggest source of fdi is india itself. indian money departs on a short holiday to mauritius, before returning home as fdi. perhaps not all the fdi streaming in from mauritius is round-tripped capital — maybe a part of it is ‘genuine’ fdi originating in europe or the u.s. but it still denotes a massive loss of tax revenue, part of the $1.2 trillion stolen from developing countries every year., what makes this theft of tax revenue not just possible but also legal is india’s >dtaa with mauritius. it’s a textbook example of ‘treaty shopping’ — a government-sponsored loophole for mnes to avoid tax by channelling investments and profits through an offshore jurisdiction., for instance, as per this dtaa, capital gains are taxable only in mauritius, not in india. but here’s the thing: mauritius does not tax capital gains. india, like any sensible country, does. what would any sensible businessman do? set up a company in mauritius, and route all indian investments through it., india signed this dtaa with mauritius in 1983, but apparently ‘woke up’ only in 2000. india has spent much of 2015 ‘trying’ to renegotiate this treaty. but with our indian-made foreign investors lobbying furiously, the talks have so far yielded nothing. meanwhile, china, which too had the same problem with mauritius, has already renegotiated its dtaa, and it can force investors to pay 10 per cent capital gains tax in china., changing profile of tax havenstax havens such as mauritius thrive parasitically, feeding on substantive economies like india. back in 2000, the oecd had identified 41 jurisdictions as tax havens. today, as it humbly seeks their cooperation to combat tax avoidance, it calls them by a different name, so as not to offend them., the same list is now called — and this is not a joke — ‘jurisdictions committed to improving transparency and establishing effective exchange of information in tax matters’. distinguished members of this club include cayman islands, bermuda, bahamas, cyprus, and of course, mauritius., today the function of tax havens in the >global economy has evolved way beyond that of offering a low-tax jurisdiction. mr. shaxson describes three major elements that make tax havens tick. first, tax havens are not necessarily about geography; they are simply someplace else — a place where a country’s normal tax rules don’t apply. so, for instance, country a can serve as a tax haven for residents of country b, and vice versa. the u.s. is a classic example. it has stringent tax laws, and is energetic in prosecuting tax evasion by its citizens around the world. but it is equally keen to attract tax-evading capital from other countries, and does so through generous sops and helpful pieces of legislation which have effectively turned the u.s. into a tax haven for non-residents., second, more than the nominally low taxes, the bigger attraction of >tax havens is secrecy. secrecy is important for two reasons: to be able to avoid tax, you need to hide your real income; and to hide your real income, you need to hide your identity, so that the booty stashed away in a tax haven cannot be traced back to you by the taxmen at home. so, even a country whose taxes are not too low can function as a tax haven by offering a combination of exemptions and iron-clad secrecy — which is the formula adopted by the likes of luxembourg and the netherlands., third, the extreme combination of low taxes and high secrecy brought about a new mutation of tax havens in the 1960s: they turned themselves into offshore financial centres (ofcs). the economist ronen palan defines ofcs as “markets in which financial operators are permitted to raise funds from non-residents and invest or lend the money to other non-residents free from most regulations and taxes”. it is estimated that ofcs are recipients of 30 per cent of the world’s fdi, and are, in turn, the source of a similar quantum of fdi., such being the case, all india needs to do to attract fdi is to become an ofc, or create an ofc on its territory — bring offshore onshore, so to speak. that’s precisely what the u.s. did — it set up international banking facilities (ibfs), “to offer deposit and loan services to foreign residents and institutions free of… reserve requirements”. japan set up the japanese offshore market (jom). singapore has the asian currency market (acu), thailand has the bangkok international banking facility (bibf), malaysia has an ofc in labuan island, and other countries have similar facilities. ofcs, as ronen palan puts it, are less tax havens than regulatory havens, which means that financial capital can do here what it cannot do ‘onshore’. so every major hedge fund operates out of an ofc. given the volume of unregulated financial transactions that ofcs host, it is no surprise that they were at the heart of the 2008 financial crisis.",0.09374708095127944,hidden wealth nations,"tax havens mauritius thrive parasitically , feeding substantive economies like india. , could bumper year ever-lucrative tax avoidance industry. 2015 final reports organisation economic co-operation development ( oecd ) -led project base erosion profit shifting ( beps ) — refer erosion nation ’ tax base due accounting tricks multinational enterprises ( mnes ) legal abusive shifting profits low-tax jurisdictions respectively — lays 15 action points curb abusive tax avoidance mnes. participant project , india expected implement least measures. ?

2016-02-06,‘there is a kind of deep state in india’,"“some of the change since the period of liberalisation was due to pressure from the emerging middle class for a more open relationship with the world economy.” picture shows jewellery advertisements in bengaluru. photo: g. sampath kumar , steve coll, one of the foremost foreign correspondents and investigative reporters from the u.s., has won the pulitzer prize twice. he is a staff writer at the new yorker magazine and the dean of the columbia journalism school. he is the author of ghost wars: the secret history of the cia, afghanistan, and bin laden, from the soviet invasion to september 10, 2001 (2004), the bin ladens: an arabian family in the american century (2008) and private empire: exxonmobil and american power (2012). before all that he wrote on the grand trunk road: a journey into south asia (1994), a mixture of top-notch reporting and analysis based on his time as the washington post bureau chief for south asia based in new delhi. on a recent visit to india, mr. coll revisited the book and talked about india’s past, present and future., excerpts from the interview:, q) you reported from india as the washington post bureau chief in the early 1990s—the time when nehruvian state was staggering with bankruptcy. from that particular time to now, how much change has taken place?, it’s been dramatic and you are right, i was there at the beginning and some of it was the end of the cold war, the collapse of the soviet union, some of it was internal pressure from emerging middle class for more normal and open relationship with the world economy, and some of it was business class pushing for liberalisation and then you had leadership by manmohan singh who at that time was finance minister and started to articulate the way to describe reform without being trapped in the rhetoric of the past. it started from there and changes have been profound in a lot of ways, mostly involving economic world and the change in peoples incomes and mobility and then also in the infrastructure, not as much as the physical infrastructure as the technological infrastructure. and then the other thing on the dark side of development is traffic and the air is much worse., i was at an event on this trip and someone pulled out that book on the grand trunk road from 1994 and read a paragraph at the end of the book that was sort of about this question of reform and the future. it was a description of what i thought the middle class of india was looking for by way of leaving the nehruvian state behind. and afterwards we were all reflecting on how that statement of what needs to change is still unfulfilled in important ways even though the country has changed profoundly. it’s almost half empty, half full., q) you write in the grand trunk road that indian middle class aspire for a forward looking political party that could lead them to economic progress, eradicate corruption and make things smooth. two decades later, we saw arvind kejriwal led aam aadmi party emerging from an anti-corruption movement…what kind of future does the aap-style of politics has in india?, well, it’s interesting because you have seen these movements, sort of middle class led, urban based, outside of reform movements spring up in number of countries. i think their record is pretty mixed. on the one hand they definitely have influence, they force the incumbent parties to shift and they can take office as kejriwal has in delhi. but there aren’t too many examples of those parties going all the way to national power building and entirely new organization because i think the incumbent parties can figure out how to co-opt their message and sort of take their agenda but hold on to power to some extent. one of the reasons why that’s the pattern is because the political parties and organizing require to compete in national elections even if they win state elections. it’s not something you can build overnight, it’s a real infrastructure, and it’s not always pretty, but it’s there, it’s permanent, and at voting time you can mobilize it, use it in ways that it’s hard for a new comer to replicate. in pakistan for example, imran khan had a moment of sweeping the power from just the same kind of aspiration of urban middle class, especially in lahore. i watched his party secretariat trying to come to terms with their own moment of opportunity and all of the administration associated with that moment of excitement choosing candidates all the way down to the provincial legislative district, figuring out how to choose candidates who would be aligned with their values and not be seen as the same old order switching parties. it is a kind of self limiting process. i suppose if you stick with it for long enough and you are good at it bjp is an example of you-can-come-out-of-the-wilderness with a fairly small and marginalized political organization, you can systematically build your way back, but it takes 10-20 years at least and you have to have a sustainable vision., q) in the 1970s, we have seen how public resentment against corruption morphed into what’s famously known as jp movement, which produced a new generation of politicians. unfortunately, after serving various ministerial positions, most of them faced serious charges of corruption. you think the sustenance of political vision is subservient to how much money one can spend? does that mean if business tycoons like ambanis are on your side, you have a better chance to succeed?, having ambanis on your side is not necessary. it sort of depends on what aspect of the aspiration of urban middle class is you are talking about as the most important one. so let’s list a few: one is corruption, another is equal opportunity in education and economy. corruption is a subject that politicians are not likely to solve because it is not in their interest to solve it. otherwise, holding office would just be the same kind of a job as being a teacher; it might be stable, it might be a decent salary but it’s not that exciting, other than the opportunity to hold power and influence others. the people who have an interest in solving the corruption problem by and large are consumers and citizens and to some extent businesses, depending on which kind, small businesses, new businesses. the big ones can figure out how to work the system, they are part of the system. the way corruption usually falls in these kinds of settings, it never goes away, but if you look at the global indexes for perceived corruption around the world and you relate the clean countries to income; you could ask the question which countries are the least corrupt per income. i think you usually need some kind of pressure from outside that involves national laws and rules that force people into compliance and provide a reason why companies can resist demands for bribery and so forth. the more your economy becomes integrated in the international system, more dependent on international legitimacy it is, more corruption goes down., on the subject of equal opportunity with efficient services there i think the citizens can have more impact faster because you see this in china as well the demands are for clean exams, fair exams standards, clean admission standards, therefore, health, therefore, clean air, clean water. and when you have an open society with a freedom of information laws like india you are empowering this agenda in a way that makes it harder to resist. there the incumbent parties are willing to change, that helps them stay in power if they deliver. i think corruption debate and struggle will probably go on longer than people would like but the politics of middle class can be advanced around government’s performance., q)to have that kind of ecosystem i think it’s important to increase peoples participation in governance, empower grassroots administrative systems so that development plans are made bottom up, rather than top down, and that needs a smooth devolution of power. do you see that happening in india?, that’s a very sophisticated question. i think the particular structure of administrative districts and empowerment of district administrators and so on, that inheritance is a colonial inheritance adopted by the nehruvian state. it is clearly not an efficient design either from the perspective of corruption or the delivery of services. that aspiration to work around that system through direct delivery of services accountability from the government to citizens through mobile payments, through verification, through other kinds of technological solutions that make it harder for the nehruvian break off to incur without being nearly breaking on some electronic board. in principle that seems central because there is no constitutional design that’s easy to implement, that is going to get you very fast down that road, whereas transparency and direct contact between consumers and government around service delivery and that has the potential to make it necessary for government to respond to things that they otherwise would not. and india is in a position because it has advanced information technology and very powerful mobile phone network in a relatively dense population, coherent geography compared to certain places. all of these experiments around direct governance, they have potential. everyone learns how to game systems and so forth. there is no perfect system. putting citizens in a position to government directly through kind of a contract that connects them through technology to services they require. it is not just subsidies, like distribution of rations, but also things like air pollution….. you have in all over the world lots of models springing up that make it very difficult for governments to ignore. or annoyances like holes in the roads that should have been fixed momentarily and haven’t been. so then if you put the citizens in a position to kind of have transparent oversight over at least some of the functions of government. then the structure of the government, constitutional design matters a lot because whoever is in the government will be forced to respond to those demands otherwise they are going to have trouble at election time., q)you are suggesting a technology based solution. india is already debating net neutrality because internet freedom will be important for upward mobility as service delivery here is fast becoming it-driven, which demands easing of foreign direct investment (fdi), and which still faces a lot of political opposition. the fear is if we rely on technology that is corporate controlled, there is no guarantee poor people will get access to it…how do you look at that dynamic?, it’s always been the case in india’s independence movement, there has been this between the very deep rooted values of freedom and openness and democratic competition and very powerful static forces, incumbent political parties, other kinds of embedded groups. that’s the distinctive feature of indian history because of the imperial inheritance but it is also india’s bottom up, sort of checks and balances and its aspirational grassroots attitudes that struggle with the state and the ability to do that without being mowed down by machine guns. that’s part of the history too., france is another example. they built this system out of the chaos of the 18th century and the inheritance of the feudal system, quasi feudal system. unlike in britain and america, they still have that state; it’s still there… those kinds of structures that come down from centuries they don’t go away that easily. but there has also been an evolution and a kind of a struggle with that state, to try to find an equilibrium that’s good for france, that’s french in character, that’s modern and connected with international economy. you can’t hide from international norms, over time you are going to have to adapt, you are going to have to adapt as far as american advice would wish you to go, and you are going to have to keep responding to these norms and rules., here is the thing i would say about the last 25 years. the balance of power in that struggle has clearly shifted away from the state and on the foreign side the ideas of reform are much more fully established, much more broadly based. in 1991, when manmohan first started making speeches about liberalization which at the time was a very modest opening compared to the ideas that are on the table today. he had to stop in his speech after a few paragraphs and say ‘no we are not surrendering into the neo-colonialism.” this is a different discourse even though the incumbents are still strong and they still fight with some of that language., q) i wonder where that power has shifted now?, if i were here, i would have a richer sense of that. but i think the problem is that it has shifted to nifty fifty and their networks more than it has shifted to empower citizens. if you count the largest economic actors in the state as one complex then what’s really shifted is a lot of power has moved out of the bureaucracy and over to the international private sector and of course their agenda is different than the nehruvian civil service bureaucracy. but it’s still not answering adequately to the demands of urban middle classes. the agenda of that sort of conglomerates is what the law the shareholders apply, which is they want to make money, they want to grow, they want to perform to international standards. and all of that creates good knock on effects but who is going to demand that government action deliver in shortest possible time transitions in the energy economy,, q) before coming into power, bjp’s election campaign was based on the idea that development is an idiom of nationalism, which i wonder whether it is a borrowing from china. but unlike china, the model of rapid development has often triggered social tensions, slowing down the progress…how do you see that parallel?, the cliché about india and china is true. china had a commanding heights-led political economy that force marched transformation of physical structure even though they displaced tens of thousands of villagers and grabbed land, there was corruption, there was over building but they were able to, in the same way that stalin forced soviet industrialization, they were able to create a first class physical infrastructure—roads, airports, air traffic control, ports in a remarkably short period of time. we know from economics that investments in physical infrastructure of that type, no matter who makes them, no matter what their motivation is, they bring economical returns, they stimulate growth, so that is their advantage. on india’s side, because it’s an open competitive political system, you can’t just grab things, and land is the most difficult thing to work thing. so a rapid priority of physical infrastructure development was always difficult here and yet the country did find a way to be into virtual infrastructure, through telecom and software and knowledge and at that kind of a global level. that provided solvent for the economy that is comparable to that china experience. but it has left india in a strange place where they have this clear confident strategy for knowledge economy for the 21ist century whereas they don’t have anything for the late 20th century physical infrastructure. that problem was much more glaring in the early 2000s. when you went to china in early 2000s you’d say ‘my god they have separated from india.’, q) with india’s changing political economy, do you see any foreign policy shifts? has that middle path of nehruvian state moved to any side?, nehru’s foreign policy was born of the need to balance the superpowers of cold war and so it’s the post-cold war foreign policy which still is work in progress….on the region, i see more continuity the way india manages its strength vis-à-vis small neighbours, which is that it does seek to integrate those small neighbours into its political and economical spheres but it is also not aggressive, it’s not going to invade, it uses soft-power to try to create coherent sphere of influence with the big naughty problem of pakistan stuck in the middle of that. now, you have pakistan as a proxy for the 50 year question of china. i think the most important problem in indian foreign policy is the same one that is the most important problem in american foreign policy, which is how do you assess china’s rise, how do you manage it, how do you prepare for multiple scenarios without somehow making things worse by provoking, giving a sense that you are headed for conflict, or into passive, setting yourself up vulnerable. i think india and us share this dilemma. i think both elites are driven by a belief, a tentative qualified belief that engagement and integration through economic integration can succeed, that the history of rising great powers provoking wars can be avoided. i think a majority of both countries’ elites prefer the optimistic engagement strategy, but i think both countries recognize especially partly based on china’s nationalism they can’t take that for granted so they are going to have to prepare a long-term defensive containment strategy to make sure that if china does become expansionist or radicalized in some way, it can be restrained., q) you think the nature of india’s foreign policy changes with the changing governments? when nda-i was in power the country started off a healthy looking dialogue with pakistan but when upa-i replaced the engagement fell apart. now bjp is in power again, and prime minister narendara modi recently surprised us with his impromptu visit to lahore. you think bjp can make significant changes via-a-vis its policy toward its neighbours; or, there is some secret state within india that controls everything from behind and the political actors at the front keep changing?, well, there is a kind of deep state in india but it is really more than indian foreign service than it is the intelligence agencies or the military. i think there is such complexity in indian foreign policymaking system. there is no, in that way similar to the us, you have a lot of constituencies around the decisions. my own thinking is that pakistani nationalism will always require hedging about india, it will always require relationship with china as a counter to the threat of indian invasion, or destruction of pakistani state. in a strategic sense, having a relationship with china is always going to make sense to pakistan. but it needs to change in order for india and pakistan to realise their potential even in that framework is for civilian leadership to emerge in pakistan and to finally as happened in indonesia, as happened in argentina, as happened in brazil, in turkey; you have countries with long periods of military rule but where eventually because of internal forces and external forces it flips and you get genuine or at least a substantial civilian control over the military. it doesn’t usually lead to sharp departures in foreign policy but it leads to significant ones and in the case of india-pakistan, if you had civilian leadership in pakistan that truly had control of the activities of the military and intelligence services you could imagine a much more normal balancing policy and politics that didn’t involve proxy groups and violence and your relationship between pakistan and china could evolve, and the relationship between pakistan and india could evolve, you could resolve some of the territorial conflicts, you could start to cooperate on economic and infrastructure issues, you could start to cooperate on energy and water and a lot of shared interests there they have but it would require a different government., q) what we are seeing that the civilian government in india is run by a rightwing political party, which has promised to people in the past that if they come to power they will retaliate against pakistan. do you see bjp led india heading toward provoking war in future?",0.09457778039349042,‘there kind deep state india ’,"“some change since period liberalisation due pressure emerging middle class open relationship world economy. ” picture shows jewellery

2016-02-20,labour in the twenty-first century,"on february 24, the rss-affiliated central trade union bharatiya mazdoor sangh (bms) will hold a nationwide protest against the nda government’s labour law reforms. on march 10, all the 11 central trade union organisations (ctuos), including the bms, will observe a national protest day. and in end-march, they are planning a mass convention on labour policies to mobilise workers. all this comes in the wake of a 15-point pre-budget memorandum of demands that the ctuos had submitted to the union finance minister in january., ask any top executive from india inc. and he would tell you that india has a labour problem. and the international labour organisation (ilo) would agree. so here’s a quick but unconventional overview of india’s ‘labour problem’., there are eight core ilo conventions against forced labour (also known, in less euphemistic times, as slavery). india refuses to ratify four of those: c87 (freedom of association and protection of the right to organise convention); c98 (the right to organise and collective bargaining convention); c138 (minimum age convention), and c182 (worst forms of child labour convention). india also refuses to ratify another major convention, c131, or the minimum wage fixing convention. these refusals in themselves present a succinct picture of the status of, as well as the state’s attitude to, labour welfare in india., the annual global rights index, published by the international trade union confederation (ituc), rates 141 countries on 97 indicators derived from ilo standards. the rating is on a scale of 1 to 5-plus, based on the degree of respect accorded to workers’ rights. in 2015, india had a rating of 5, the second-worst category. it denotes “no guarantee of rights”. despite being a constitutional democracy, on the matter of worker rights, india is in the same club as saudi arabia, uae and qatar, all dictatorships., so yes, india certainly has a labour problem. and a reform of the present labour regime is a must. but what form should this reform take?, in 2014, the industry body ficci (federation of indian chambers of commerce and industry) and aioe (all india organisation of employers) put out a paper titled “suggested labour policy reforms”. it pointed out that “india’s obsession with an archaic labour policy… is keeping investors away, hindering employment growth and making indian enterprises uncompetitive”. the paper goes on argue that it is the multiplicity (44 central and 100-odd at the state-level) of labour laws that is pushing workers to the informal sector, as companies seek “to circumvent the rigorous labour policies”., according to the ilo, “labour market flexibility is as high as 93 per cent in india”. this means that 93 per cent of india’s workforce anyway do not enjoy the protection of india’s 144 labour laws. but industry’s solution to the labour problem is a dilution of these laws so that the mass of informal workers can be employed formally, but without legal protections., contrary to the ilo-mandated norm of tripartite consultations between employers, the state, and the unions in formulation of labour legislations, the nda government has been faithfully following the ficci-aioe script, brushing aside ctuo demands. unless this policy direction is reversed, labour rights and trade unions will become history so far as india is concerned. so the big question is: do india’s trade unions have it in them to lead the fight in the face of this legislative blitz?, the ctuos offered a preliminary answer when they came together to pull off a massive general strike on september 2, 2015, which is estimated to have cost the national economy some rs. 25,000 crore. only the rss-affiliated bms pulled out at the last minute, so as not to embarrass the ruling nda., many commentators, however, have dismissed this show of strength as mere tokenism. they point to the increasing irrelevance of trade unions in general, and the ctuos in particular., firstly, the argument goes, in a globalised indian economy, the centre of gravity has shifted from manufacturing to services. secondly, even in manufacturing, the advent of global supply chains has meant a mass informalisation of employment as multinational enterprises break up the production process and sub-contract to suppliers in different parts of the world. this new norm of fragmented production signals a major victory for capital over labour., to cite just one example, as reported by the ngo, the india committee of the netherlands, 80 per cent of the garment workers in bengaluru toil in sweatshop conditions. they make-in-india for reputed global brands such as gap, h&m, tommy hilfiger and zara — without ever being employees of gap, h&m, tommy hilfiger or zara. this kind of employment will become the legal norm for india’s workers when the proposed amendments become law., such hyper-exploitative industrial zones have been around for a while — from sriperumbudur in chennai to bengaluru to manesar in the national capital region. but india’s ctuos have so far proved incapable of impeding this onslaught., given their failure to mobilise effectively around these adverse changes, the latest salvo of imminent labour reforms has turned the spotlight back on the ctuos’ traditional weaknesses, which could prove to be fatal flaws in the confrontation between labour and capital in the current economic scenario., the first problem is their political party affiliation. of the big five unions, with a combined claimed membership of over 79 million, the bms (17.1 million members) owes allegiance to the ruling nda; intuc (indian national trade union congress), with a membership of 33.3 million, is affiliated to the congress; citu (centre of indian trade unions, 5.7 million) is an extension of the cpi(m); aituc (all india trade union congress, 14.2 million) is a wing of the cpi; and hms (hind mazdoor sabha, 9.1 million) used to be affiliated to the socialist parties but projects itself as an independent union today., party affiliations entail three things: one, a restriction of the ctuo’s ability to expand, as it will put off those who do not like its parent party; two, party interests often trump union/labour interests; and three, disunity between the differently-affiliated unions., for instance, the congress-affiliated intuc could not get the upa to curb the rampant violation of labour laws during its 10 long years in power. similarly, it is evident that the bms has had no say in the drafting of the nda’s labour law amendments. while their political masters — the bjp and the congress — are on the same page so far as labour reforms are concerned, the ctuos have struggled to forge a united front., their second big weakness, according to chennai-based activist v. baskar, is the leadership, which he believes is marked by the “bureaucratic mentality” of a labour aristocracy. “is it really workers who are heading the ctuos?” he asks. “they may have been workers once but today they function more like bureaucrats. they prefer policy analysis to on-ground organising. they have failed to extend their reach to the growing mass of informal workers.”, the third weakness is less to do with the unions themselves than with the changing labour landscape. with the majority of the workforce outside the purview of unions, their power to intervene or disrupt has also shrunk proportionately., but the central trade union leaders counter these criticisms. “it is true that we are more focussed on policy issues,” says tapan sen, general secretary of citu. “but that is because it’s an important battle right now. at the same time, we are also involved in struggles on the ground.”, one sector where the ctuos do admit to some difficulty is the burgeoning it services sector, which is marked by little union presence despite demanding work conditions. says aituc general secretary and cpi politician gurudas dasgupta, “yes, we haven’t made much headway in the it sector. here our biggest challenge has been the instant termination of workers involved in unionising activity. this has created tremendous fear in the minds of the workers.”, confirming that this ‘fear factor’ created by managements is a major hurdle to expansion of union activity, intuc president g. sanjeeva reddy says, “right now industry is aiming for two things: to legalise and expand contract labour; and to develop in-house unions which will dance to the tunes of the management and stay away from ctuos.”, says mr. sen: “till about a decade ago, our main challenge was in mobilising the workers in secret and somehow getting the documents to the labour department for registering the union. once that was done, the trade union became a fait accompli. but today, the state has become such a shameless collaborator that the moment the union papers reach the labour department, a call goes to the employer. they obtain the names of the workers who had applied, and terminate all of them.”, mr. sen and mr. dasgupta both point out that another hurdle in organising it workers is their mindset. “they get paid a little more, and just because they wear a tie, good shoes, and have a nice office, they don’t think of themselves as workers. when their exploitation becomes unbearable, their mindset will change. we will be ready for them when the crisis strikes, as it inevitably will,” says mr. sen., harbhajan singh sidhu, general secretary of hms, points to a larger pattern: “on the one hand, workers anywhere who try to organise a union are immediately terminated — with the state looking the other way. and on the other, there is this constant chorus of voices singing the declining relevance of unions. can you see what is happening?”, mr. sidhu also rejects the charge of disunity among the ctuos. “all the unions are unanimous on two points: regularisation of contract workers engaged in perennial work; and equal pay for contract workers performing the same job as permanent workers.”, even the bms, known for striking out on its own, has been collaborating with ctuos of ideologically opposite persuasions. says b.n. rai, president, bms: “we are with the other unions in our opposition to three things: fdi, disinvestment and labour reforms. as for labour reforms, the government can reform all it wants provided three entitlements are not compromised: sufficient wages, job security, and worker security. because the labour law amendments are a frontal attack on these, we will oppose them.”, striking an ironic note, mr. dasgupta points out that much of the credit for uniting the ctuos should go to the nda administration: “the current government’s virulent attempt to crush the trade unions has actually helped build unprecedented unity among the different unions.”, of course, the series of actions planned in march will be a test not only of the ctuo’s unity but also their strength. mr. dasgupta rubbishes claims that india’s ctuos are a spent force rendered even more irrelevant by the absence of a base outside the organised sectors. “we may have limitations.” he says. “but the central trade unions are still very strong in the strategic sectors — oil, coal, banking, defence, insurance. and we will keep fighting the anti-worker programme of this government.”",0.08175074237057704,labour twenty-first century,"february 24 , rss-affiliated central trade union bharatiya mazdoor sangh ( bms ) hold nationwide protest nda government ’ labour law reforms. march 10 , 11 central trade union organisations ( ctuos ) , including bms , observe national protest day. end-march , planning mass convention labour policies mobilise workers. comes wake 15-point pre-budget memorandum demands ctuos submitted union finance minister january. , ask top executive india inc. would tell india labour problem. international labour organisation ( ilo ) would agree. ’ quick unconventional overview india ’ ‘labour problem ’ . , eight core ilo conventions forced labour ( also known , less euphemistic times , slavery ) . india refuses ratify four : c87 ( freedom association protection right organise convention ) ;

2016-02-26,meeting great expectations,"budget-making remains an enigma. expectations always outstrip reality. in a sense, it is perceived to be a panacea for our economic ailments. finance ministers are hard put to prejudge and predict its outcome. will it click? will the chemistry work? this is in spite of the 25 years of economic liberalisation, covering trade, expenditure, tax policies, infrastructure to mention a few., i have argued several times earlier that the budgetary process must be demystified. the practice of locking up staff and officers for it, notwithstanding the high-quality halwa being served to them, is anachronistic and reveals the need for real change in practices and processes. that will lend greater transparency, ensure predictability and continuity by adopting what the rest of the world does. the ‘oecd best practices for budget transparency’ report argues that “a pre-budget report serves to encourage debate on the budget aggregates and how they interact with the economy. as such, it also serves to create appropriate expectations for the budget itself.” policymaking is a continuing process and the budget is only one, although important, act in the annual policy cycle., global and domestic scenarios the international backdrop is full of uncertainties. on the external front, oil and commodity prices are likely to remain soft. while hurting many commodity-exporting economies, this has given us greater fiscal room and less painful rationalisation of subsidies for petroleum and fertilisers, high current account balance due to lower value of imports, and lower inflation. the u.s. upturn looks halting. europe, a mixed basket, is struggling to cope with the geopolitics of unplanned and unwanted migration. the chinese slowdown looks prolonged — uncertainties surround exchange rate behaviour, recovery pattern and the probability of a ‘soft landing’., fortunately, our macro fundamentals and growth trends remain robust. inflation is subdued — the wholesale price index (wpi) is negative for the 15th month in succession, while the consumer price index (cpi), at 5.69 per cent, is more obstinate, largely due to weightage and high inflation in some food products, particularly lentils, and more recently vegetable, eggs, meat, and fish. current account deficit is down to 0.7 per cent, fdi flows registered a 48 per cent increase during october 2014-april 2015, reserves are at a healthy $349.97 billion (as of september 25, 2015) and the central statistics office (cso) has projected a gdp growth of 7.6 per cent. while the methodology of gdp computations is unbiased, there are persistent doubts that the real economy does not feel a growth of 7.6 per cent in overall gdp and a higher growth in services and manufacturing. rural demand remains weak, and stalled projects in the private sector remain high. non-oil and non-gold imports, which are a commonly used indicator of domestic demand, are also soft. part of the problem is, no doubt, the curious divergence between nominal and real gdp growth with negative wpi., also read: >budget to bet on spurring growth, some important policy options are the following. first is the issue of fiscal consolidation versus growth. the finance minister had presented a new fiscal road map entailing a fiscal deficit of 3.9 per cent this year and declining to 3.5 per cent in the coming year. given that private investment is subdued and hesitant, should the fiscal road map for next year be recalibrated to, say, 3.7 per cent or 3.8 per cent? the resultant extra resources (to the tune of rs.28,000-rs.42,000 crore) can be used to support public outlays in infrastructure. private investment could then piggyback on enhanced public outlays and create a multiplier effect., changing fiscal goalposts while these are positives, there are other concerns. it is unclear if we have the implementation capability to gainfully spend the additional resources. are resources, then, the principal constraint in enhancing reach and quality of infrastructure? further, a recalibration of the fiscal road map raises issues of credibility and compromising the hard-earned macro stability, given international fragility. relaxing the fiscal target may also raise concerns about the sustainability of public debt going forward. moreover, can the market absorb more public debt, particularly when uday (ujwal discom assurance yojana), the new programme designed to improve the financial health of power utilities, requires state governments to issue additional bonds? in a more holistic sense, of course, we can discuss an ideal fiscal road map. how are these calculated? should they be cyclically adjusted? however, the sanctity of any accepted road map is relevant. having accepted a fiscal map only last year, changing it now, when soft oil and commodity prices have enhanced fiscal space and notwithstanding expenditure pressures, particularly from the seventh pay commission and the orop (one rank one pension) payouts, can raise concerns of both investors and rating agencies. investors also believe that a more accommodative monetary policy, by way of lower interest rate, would have greater multiplier effect. a somewhat looser fiscal policy would weaken the case for lower interest rates and rekindle inflationary expectations., in the end of course, the hiatus between growth and fiscal policy is a false one. we need both fiscal consolidation and sustaining of the growth momentum. enhancing non-tax revenues through a more robust disinvestment programme can reconcile this hiatus. given stock-market volatilities, the timing of selling the family silver is important but if proceeds from disinvestment are earmarked for infrastructure, the asset-swapping could overcome this moral hazard. of course, earmarking outgoes from the consolidated fund is an optical fiction. deployment of resources is always fungible., also read: >govt. may penalise higher pf savings, fixing the banking rot second, there is renewed public focus on our financial system. current estimates on non-performing assets (npas) of banks vary widely and while rs.3.36 lakh crore (by september 2015) is the proximate figure, the more likely number is rs.5 lakh crore. the impending npas could make this higher. clearly, impaired assets are the outcome of poor judgment, politically directed loans to favour corporates or individuals and bank managements acting in cohort. the supreme court has sought the names of defaulters. there is need for public accountability, both on the causes and responsibilities for the present malaise. one approach is to create a bad bank or asset reconstruction fund, where all the impaired assets are transferred and balance sheets of banks cleaned up followed by significant recapitalisation. this recapitalisation programme would be an inescapable part of the budget and may not add to fiscal deficit based on international practices. over the medium term, apart from the indradhanush programme to improve bank management, professionalise and de-politicise banking, we need to revisit the issue of governance. governance and ownership are two faces of the same coin. revisiting the issue of public ownership, initiated by an earlier national democratic alliance government, needs wider public debate among various stakeholders., also read: >focus budget: lower the corporate tax rate, gst, corporate tax and ppps third, on tax reforms, hopefully the gst (goods and services tax) legislation can be enacted sooner than later. its compelling economic rationale needs no reiteration. the shadows of retrospective taxation continue to hound us. containing its damage by other means like accepting arbitration awards, not appealing against court decisions, seeking alternative dispute redressal mechanisms have failed to dispel investor uncertainties. even at the risk of triggering some controversies over the immediate beneficiaries, it would strengthen credibility and allay subsisting investor concerns if the retrospective tax provision was repealed. regrettably, there are no other shortcuts.",0.07356478003172222,meeting great expectations,"budget-making remains enigma. expectations always outstrip reality. sense , perceived panacea economic ailments. finance ministers hard put prejudge predict outcome. click ?

2016-03-31,road map for a robust defence industry,"after the modi government came to power, one of the early reforms ushered in was the raising of the foreign direct investment limit in defence from 26 per cent to 49 per cent under the automatic route., the reform could have hardly been deferred. india, the world’s largest arms importer, relies on imports to meet more than 70 per cent of its defence requirements. this figure could rise embarrassingly if the value of foreign components in defence ware, touted as indigenous products, is not excluded from the category of defence imports., the new policy evidenced the rejection of misplaced notions of patriotism and protectionism that had previously, in all but name, frustrated the entry of both the domestic industry and foreign companies into the defence sector. the reform was further leavened by the prime minister’s statement that a robust indigenous defence industry is imperative to make india “self-reliant in the area of security”., major corporate houses are now scrambling to forge tie-ups with foreign defence companies. while this is a very encouraging development, many attendant reforms need to be embraced to achieve the policy goal outlined by the prime minister. this is because the defence industry is like no other. it is evolutionary, highly technology-intensive, and demands continuously high levels of research and development (r&d) investment., therefore, the focus of any policy should be to draw foreign defence manufacturers to india and, in the process, gain technology transfer. to accomplish this, an enabling architecture that would guarantee the protection of their intellectual property rights (ipr) and commercial interests is key. this would require two strategic changes: the fdi ceiling in defence should be revised upwards and the defence procurement procedure (dpp) has to be fine-tuned to integrate its various components with the liberalised investment regime., the following strategies related to these two aspects could be implemented to yield rich dividends. first, with regard to fdi, we are almost there. given the peculiarities of the sector, it would be pragmatic to permit even 100 per cent under the automatic route, subject to certain conditions. the case for this is compelling. even after raising the ceiling to 49 per cent, the inflow in 2015 under the head “defence industries” was only $0.08 million. a major reason is that there is no real difference between 26 per cent and 49 per cent for investors, save their entitlement to larger profits., profit is not the main issue; it is the absence of the desired level of control that investing entities will have over their technologies with 49 per cent ownership that acts as the dampener. as economics professor jurgen brauer has cautioned, no transferring country will idly stand by while their products are “shipped abroad and effective competition is created”., given the overwhelming concern for safeguarding ipr, the removal of the fdi ceiling would yield rich dividends. the transformation of the indian automobile industry after 100 per cent fdi was permitted may be an educative example. it helped india become an important export base for some of the best brands. arguments that lifting the ceiling on fdi in defence would “decimate” the local industry do not deserve any serious consideration as they are starkly similar to the fears expressed when limits were lifted in the automobile sector., second, use the mandatory offset (compensations that buyers obtain from sellers) to bolster the ‘make in india’ programme. when using this strategy, it would be wise to remember that offsets do not come free. they are indeed paid for by the buyer. a study conducted in belgium concluded that an additional cost of 20-30 per cent was loaded on contracts as expenses for discharging offset obligations. such loading emanates from the fact that offsets are trade distorting., as offsets come at a substantial cost, they would need to be steered. for fulfilling offset obligations, identify equipment from a shelf of projects carefully created to fill identified gaps in indian defence technology. make it compulsory for companies to locally produce such equipment with predetermined levels of indigenisation to be achieved over the years. for such projects, permit up to 76 per cent fdi under the automatic route, thereby giving foreign investors sufficient control over the established entity., third, complement the above strategy by employing multipliers (assigning higher value) where foreign companies manufacture defence wares identified to be of critical need for the services. in such cases, allow 100 per cent fdi, mandating only a reporting requirement to the ministry of defence., fourth, establish a separate department of overseas acquisitions in the ministry of defence for establishing special purpose vehicles with identified private sector entities to take over foreign companies. the department should in effect function as a defence sovereign wealth fund., fifth, finance and support r&d/production in the private sector as the u.s. does (the development and production of u-2, the highly successful reconnaissance aircraft, in the 1950s is a good model)., sixth, create a body in the ministry of deference consisting of civilian officers, defence personnel and industry leaders to evaluate fdi flows, steer these flows and offsets, identify foreign companies for acquisition, etc. the mandate of this body should be to achieve convergence of various strategies being implemented by multiple bodies.",0.07848167388167389,road map robust defence industry,"modi government came power , one early reforms ushered raising foreign direct investment limit defence 26 per cent 49 per cent automatic route. , reform could hardly deferred. india , world ’ largest arms importer , relies imports meet 70 per cent defence requirements. figure could rise embarrassingly value foreign components defence ware , touted indigenous products , excluded category defence imports. , new policy evidenced rejection misplaced notions patriotism protectionism previously , name , frustrated entry domestic industry foreign companies defence sector. reform leavened prime minister ’ statement robust indigenous defence industry imperative make india “self-reliant area security ” . , major corporate houses scrambling forge tie-ups foreign defence companies. encouraging development , many attendant reforms need embraced achieve policy goal outlined prime minister. defence industry like other. evolutionary , highly technology-intensive , demands continuously high levels research development ( r&d ) investment. , therefore , focus policy draw foreign defence manufacturers india , process , gain technology transfer. accomplish , enabling architecture would guarantee protection intellectual property rights ( ipr ) commercial interests key. would require two strategic changes : fdi ceiling defence revised upwards defence procurement procedure ( dpp ) fine-tuned integrate various components liberalised investment regime. , following strategies related two aspects could implemented yield rich dividends. first , regard fdi , almost there. given peculiarities sector , would pragmatic permit even 100 per cent automatic route , subject certain conditions. case compelling. even raising ceiling 49 per cent , inflow 2015 head “defence industries ” $ 0.08 million. major reason real difference 26 per cent 49 per cent investors , save entitlement larger profits. , profit main issue ;

2016-05-12,taxing times for the nation,"great divide: “in the india of the present, the burden of sacrifices is exclusively placed on the marginalised and the oppressed, while the powerful and the wealthy, leave alone sacrificing for the nation, do not even pay what is simply due from them.” picture shows income tax-assessees in bengaluru. file photo: k. gopinathan | photo credit: k_gopinathan , when the government released detailed income tax data a few days ago, it gave us an opportunity to study one of the vital areas of our economic life, hitherto hidden from public scrutiny. it expectedly generated commentary on the implications of the data for the economy and so on. but what it has not generated is moral and political reflection on the data., if we consider the data from the latter point of view, two things emerge. one: the data cannot be termed as anything but shocking. and two: more, importantly, the data gives the lie, in a searing fashion, to the recent discourse of nationalism, sponsored by the ruling party and the government, and amplified by the elite classes., numbers do not add up how is it that in the year 2012-13, there were, believe it or not, three individuals who paid a tax of rs.100 crore or more? in the same year, there were 46 dollar billionaires in india who were collectively worth $176 billion, or rs.11.61 lakh crore; that is ten times more than the rs.1.14 lakh crore collected from all the individual income taxpayers in the country! how is it that there were only 18,358 individuals who had an income over rs.1 crore, and only a million people with incomes over rs.10 lakh? this is when, as a report put it, in 2011-12, four luxury carmakers alone sold 25,645 vehicles with an average price of rs.40 lakh., in total, there were 2.87 crore individual income tax returns in 2012-13 (out of a population of 125 crore), out of which 1.6 crore assessees did not actually pay any tax. so, effectively, income tax payers amounted to 1 per cent! to give a comparative sense, canada (of course, a g8 country), had the same — 2.88 crore returns, out of a population of 3.5 crore!, amazingly, the tax-gdp ratio has remained almost constant even after two and a half decades of spectacular growth and wealth creation in which the gdp increased 4.5 times (the recent social media buzz was that india is now the fastest-growing economy in the world, overtaking even china). in the mid-1990s, there were only two dollar billionaires with a combined worth of $3.2 billion. but in 2016, there were 111 billionaires with a net worth of $308 billion, or rs.20.48 lakh crore., the statistics are evidence of shocking levels of tax evasion, fraud and also legally sanctioned tax breaks on income and wealth favouring the richest classes. what does this mean for the discourse of nation and nationalism? what kind of a nation are we talking about when vast numbers of its middle and upper classes, the so-called wealth creators, are the very sections that eviscerate the economic vitals of the nation by not contributing to the national cause?, the new ‘nationalism’ the “drain of wealth” theory was one of the greatest economic and moral weapons of the indian nationalists against colonial rule. ironically, the nation is subject to the same drain of wealth now. around $450 billion has gone out of india, illegally, from 2002. in the same period, the fdi inflows into india were around $150 billion. as frantz fanon, the philosopher and anti-colonial revolutionary, noted many decades ago, in the wake of independence from colonial rule, the colonial exploiter is replaced by the native exploiter. nationalism thus becomes an “empty shell, a crude and fragile travesty of what it might have been”., the current nationalist/anti-nationalist binary is the most potent example of this travesty. an anti-national is one who refuses to chant “bharat mata ki jai”, not the one who refuses to pay tax. one can indulge in the grossest forms of economic corruption and participate in shoring up an exploitative economic order, but that does not make one anti-nationalist. as economists have shown, india is an extreme case when it comes to relying overwhelmingly on indirect taxes, with its catastrophic consequences for the poor, unlike the developed countries, which rely overwhelmingly on direct taxes on income and wealth., why any of this does not cause any moral outrage is because nationalism has been reduced to a symbolic/cultural entity unyoked from its material underpinnings. that is why we see the exaggerated and virulent battles around the emotive idea of the nation, rather than its material organisation. while the prime minister of iceland resigns over his name figuring in the panama papers, there is hardly a ripple in india regarding the indian names in them. while the “nationalist” government is proactive in jailing “seditious” students, it is hardly serious about investigating the 1,200 powerful indians in the swiss leaks. as fanon would have put it, it “provides nationalism alone as food for the masses”., benedict anderson had shown that the nation is conceived as a community; that is, despite the huge disparities between people within the nation, it is imagined as a comradeship. as he put it, “ultimately it is this fraternity that makes it possible, over the past two centuries, for so many millions of people, not so much to kill, as willingly to die for such limited imaginings.” in the india of the present, the burden of such sacrifices is exclusively placed on the marginalised and the oppressed castes and classes, while the powerful and the wealthy, leave alone sacrificing for the nation, do not even pay what is simply due from them., this is the conceit of nationalism that no one who profits from it wants to address. by joining the circus supposedly exposing corruption perpetrated by politicians, the privileged conveniently ignore their own participation in the economic fraud perpetrated on the nation. their rapturous singing of the national anthem, wittingly or unwittingly, becomes a mask. evading taxes is not an aberration; it is a mundane activity. if “no taxation without representation” was the rallying crying of the american revolution, in india there is representation without taxation.",0.08219101731601733,taxing times nation,"great divide : “in india present , burden sacrifices exclusively placed marginalised oppressed , powerful wealthy , leave alone sacrificing nation , even pay simply due them. ” picture shows income tax-assessees bengaluru. file photo : k. gopinathan &#124; photo credit : k_gopinathan , government released detailed income tax data days ago , gave us opportunity study one vital areas economic life , hitherto hidden public scrutiny. expectedly generated commentary implications data economy on. generated moral political reflection data. , consider data latter point view , two things emerge. one : data cannot termed anything shocking. two : , importantly , data gives lie , searing fashion , recent discourse nationalism , sponsored ruling party government , amplified elite classes. , numbers add year 2012-13 , , believe , three individuals paid tax rs.100 crore ?

2016-05-28,the new game changer in pakistan,"illustration: keshav , is china about to transform pakistan? the unanimous consensus in pakistan is that it is, and quite comprehensively too. since april 2015, the term which has probably received far greater traction in the print and electronic media, more than any other, is “game changer”., this term does not refer to the change in policy and tactics of the pakistan military, which initiated armed action against different categories of militants and islamist radicals, first in the pakistani region, the federally administered tribal areas (fata), and now more comprehensively in the rest of pakistan under its “zarb-e-azb” campaign, and has by most accounts changed the game regarding support for pakistan’s islamist radicals, and as a result, allowed the military to re-emerge as pakistan’s dominant institution. the “game changer”, which government officials, military generals, diplomats, journalists and a host of other observers refer to, is the $46 billion >china-pakistan economic corridor (cpec) project, a highway which is to run from kashgar in china to gwadar in balochistan, on the edge of the persian gulf, in pakistan., fate changer this economic corridor has been called a “game changer” and even a “fate changer” by an overly enthusiastic pakistani press and government, with some analysts even saying that this $46 billion “unprecedented” chinese investment over the next decade-and-a-half will make pakistan the next asian tiger. there has been an effusive “thank you” by government officials and by analysts and journalists made to china for agreeing to build the corridor, with important pakistani commentators going so far as saying that this measure “speaks volumes about the commitment of the chinese leadership towards pakistan and its 180 million people”, especially when contrasted to the (only) $5 billion investment made by the u.s. in the period 2009-15., moreover, the fact that the chinese president, when he visited pakistan in 2015, >agreed to the $46 billion investment also gave rise to a sense of gloating in the press, since he promised only $20 billion in investment to india when he visited the country in 2014. the pakistani finance minister stated that the corridor would change the destiny not just of pakistan, but of three billion people in the region! such has been the hype over the projected road. clearly, all provincial governments (with their own particular ethnic and regional alliances), political parties and interests realise the huge externalities which are expected to accrue to the infrastructure and road building along the corridor, and hence their interest in acquiring political and economic returns from it., there is an expectation, well-founded no doubt, that such projects will give rise to jobs (particularly unskilled ones), will allow local businesses to benefit, and might open the way to development. fortunately, some sceptical commentators, the very few who dare to voice caution amidst the euphoric din still ringing through pakistan and having to contend with allegations that they are unpatriotic and anti-national, have questioned whether the chinese investment represents chinese strategic and economic interests solely focussed on what will benefit china, much more than it does economic investment which might be of some benefit to pakistan in the end., the chinese president’s visit gave rise to the signing of 51 memoranda of understanding and projects worth $46 billion in sectors which include energy, infrastructure, security, and broader economic development. for energy, $34 billion investment was envisaged and $12 billion in infrastructure projects. it was estimated that $15.5 billion would be spent on coal, wind, solar, and hydroelectric projects. the ambitious plan includes energy projects with a capacity close to 10,000 mw to be completed by 2018, with more to follow. most of the money is expected to be spent on the construction of the corridor itself. one of the key externalities to the chinese investment is the fact that a >“special security division” of the pakistan army, consisting of perhaps 10,000 pakistani troops and headed by a major general, would be set up to guard the chinese workers and their investment, particularly in balochistan, given the militancy and insurgency in the province., scale of the project even a year after the initiation of the cpec project, there continues to be much ambiguity about what the $46 billion project entails. there is little public information and disclosure as to what will be built, how it will be financed (that is, whether some of the money will be a grant or a loan, and on what terms and from whom), and who will implement the various parts of the corridor, which includes roads, railway lines, pipelines and other infrastructure. in fact, other than the more obvious road which will link kashgar to gwadar, some other projects — such as a metro bus route in the city of lahore — are reportedly to be part of the corridor. such is the absence of public information about this huge “fate changer”, causing much controversy and consternation, with allegations that the punjab and its incumbent government, which is also in power in islamabad, will benefit disproportionately. already, the provincial governments of khyber pakhtunkhwa and balochistan have claimed that they have been short-changed., nevertheless, one cannot deny the fact that sections of what might constitute the corridor have been constructed in the last year and work is underway in many regions. an important indicator of the work in progress is the huge chinese foreign direct investment (fdi) which has come into pakistan over the last year. pakistan has been an fdi-starved country for a host of reasons, but the first 10 months of the current fiscal year (pakistan’s fiscal year runs from july to end june) saw fdi increase by 5 per cent on a year-on-year basis, to $1 billion, of which 55 per cent came from china alone. in fact, china’s contribution to pakistan’s fdi increased 152 per cent over this period. the largest chunk of the fdi, 52 per cent, has gone to the power sector, suggesting that work on cpec-related infrastructure is underway. much of the hype about the cpec has also led to a “feel good” factor about prospects for pakistani development, and many business and investment interests are waiting in the wings to cash in once the corridor and its ancillary investments take off.",0.11155877976190476,new game changer

2016-06-05,"modi in america: ‘strategic autonomy,’ ‘non-alignment’ in his diplomatic lexicon","senator bob corker, powerful republican chairman of the u.s senate foreign relations committee, and a prospective vice-presidential candidate, has called for a “brutal and honest assessment” of india-u.s. relations, charging that “trade and investment remain principally transactional for the indians rather than serving as indispensable tools to establishing a genuinely free-market economy.” india could plead guilty as charged. to be fair, his submission was that let there be less hype and “more sober and pragmatic approach” to bilateral ties. that sober approach is already taking place in considerable measure in the u.s. , “prime minister modi has made repeated statements about undertaking economic reforms…. however, the rhetoric has far outpaced the reforms,” senator bob corker, powerful republican chairman of the u.s senate foreign relations committee, and a prospective vice-presidential candidate, said recently., what rhetoric is the senator referring to? mr. modi has created some rhetoric on reforms and economic growth; and then, there are others who interpreted mr. modi, creating another layer of rhetoric. purveyors of mr. modi’s politics have oversold him as an over-the-counter delivery point for all that the u.s businesses ever wished from successive indian governments. many of them now accuse him of not delivering on reforms; some have also suddenly discovered his alleged communal agenda., what they thought and what he said , before making the distinction between what many commentators thought mr. modi said about reforms and what he actually did say about reforms, we must look at what is the current state of play in india-u.s. ties. mr. modi reaches washington on monday on a three-day visit, the fourth since he became pm in may 2014, to review the progress in ties with president barack obama, and to address a joint a session of the u.s congress. , strategic issues, commercial ties, many commentators in the u.s lament that there is convergence between india and the u.s on strategic issues, but the same it not true when it comes to commercial relations. in india, most people who are desirous of better relations between the countries lament that the strategic convergence on the east, with regard to china is going perfect, but on the west, u.s’s continuing indulgence towards pakistan, even in the face of protests from india makes for a contradiction. india constantly whines about u.s’s pakistan-afghanistan policy, while the u.s keeps crying foul about india’s trade/commerce policies., what are the long-standing american complaints and demands with regard to trade and commerce? india’s intellectual property protection regime is not good enough, its emphasis on localisation of manufacturing is bad; bureaucracy is troublesome, dispute resolution is protracted, fdi caps are restrictive, public sector units must be dismantled, labour laws should be flexible, land acquisition must be instantaneous., mr. modi’s critics on the left said he would do all this to please the americans; ironically, his overenthusiastic supporters also said the same thing, in order to woo investors. the images of mr. modi that his opponents and supporters created converged on the question of what he would do to get investment to india., >also read, modi on modi, but how exactly does mr. modi think of himself on this account? at least on two occasions in the last three years, mr. modi has defined himself., “people want to know who is the real modi — hindu nationalist leader or pro-business chief minister?” he was asked in an interview in 2013. “i’m nationalist. i’m patriotic. nothing is wrong. i’m a born hindu. nothing is wrong. so, i’m a hindu nationalist so yes, you can say i’m a hindu nationalist because i’m a born hindu. i’m patriotic so nothing is wrong in it. as far as progressive, development-oriented, workaholic, whatever they say, this is what they are saying. so there’s no contradiction between the two. it's one and the same image.”, mr. modi defined himself again when he travelled to japan, three months after he took over as pm in 2014. “we took many such decisions one after another. …it is my impression that we are taking decisions fast since being a gujarati, trade and commerce is in my veins. hence i understand these things well. i don’t think businessmen need more concessions.”, therefore, mr. modi -- according to him -– is a nationalist, a hindu nationalist, a patriot, development oriented, trader who understands where his interests lie., he said nothing on these issues, mr. modi did promise an environment that is conducive for businesses. he never promised or indicated that he would dismantle the existing ipr regime in india, or abolish compulsory licensing, dilute localization of manufacturing, dismantle psus, or allow hire and fire of workers. these were what others said he would. he never corrected them, because it suited him to a great extent. , making it smooth for investors, in the last two years, the modi’s government’s focus has been on smoothening the interface between the investors and the state., several administrative measures have been taken in that direction, to make investors feel welcome in india. there is difference between that and letting the investors dictate terms., in all this, the pm’s focus has been -- as it was for his predecessor manmohan singh -- to create jobs in india., it is all for creating jobs, mr. modi would happily have apple set shop in india, but won’t allow it to import used and refurbished phones into india. because he has to give people jobs, not cell phones. mr. modi and his ministers who traveled to the u.s. in the last two years have repeatedly sought to convince american investors that a rule-driven and predictable ecosystem for business is being put in place. at least that has been the attempt., new polarisation in south asia , now, on the question of strategic convergence between the u.s. and india. on the first anniversary of the modi government, south asia scholar bruce riedel observed the emergence of a new polarisation in south asia, echoing a sentiment commonplace among a lot of well-meaning friends of india.“….the bipolar alliance system in south asia has hardened. while the alliance system remains completely informal, the u.s. and india have come closer to each other, and china and pakistan have come much closer together., the current alliance structure has its origins in events dating back to 1962, but it has accelerated dramatically in the last year.”, against obama’s pro-pakistan tilt, but in its second year, the modi government spent considerable time protesting the obama administration’s generous policies towards pakistan and dealing with constant american “encouragement” to restart talks with islamabad., partly owing to his political upbringing and self-image, and partly as result of the experience of two years in office, mr. modi perhaps thinks it is time to reiterate some elementary facts about his strategic policy. first came an explanation from indian ambassador to the u.s. arun k. singh a few weeks ago, talking to an elite audience in washington., ‘strategic autonomy with india’, “since we india and the u.s. are getting closer and do a lot of things together…people are asking us, what kind of a relationship is this?……there is tremendous assertion in india that in any partnership that we build, we maintain the strategic autonomy in our decision making.”, more shock was in store for those who thought mr. modi had banished the concept of strategic autonomy. specifically addressing an american audience through an interview to the wall street journal last week, the pm said, for him, ‘reforms’ is what benefits people, he considered psus strategically significant, ‘hire and fire’ labour policy was unsuitable for india, and lo and behold, “there is no reason to change india’s non-alignment policy that is a legacy and has been in place.” all this, while affirming his commitment to enhancing india’s relations with the u.s., ‘brutal assessment of india-u.s. ties’, senator corker has called for a “brutal and honest assessment” of india-u.s. relations, charging that “trade and investment remain principally transactional for the indians rather than serving as indispensable tools to establishing a genuinely free-market economy.” india could plead guilty as charged. to be fair, his

2016-06-08,celluloid conversations with an ex-taxi driver,"siya chandrie is a busy 17-year-old. her first documentary film the silenced siren (2015) is going places., it has already been screened at three festivals: the 19th international children's film festival of india (icffi), hyderabad in november 2015, kala ghoda arts festival (kgaf) in february 2016 and the 12th international association of women in radio & television asian women’s film festival, delhi in march 2016., chandrie’s film won the golden elephant award for best film in the youth category at the icffi, and received a special jury mention at the kgaf. this month, the 12-minute documentary will be travelling to the international youth film festival in langesund, norway., chandrie made the film last year, as part of the y-impact project (yip), a summer programme on filmmaking she had signed up for. this one-and-a-half month course is one of mumbai-based arts education company the pomegranate workshop’s (tpw) many summer initiatives. currently celebrating its tenth year, tpw was founded by chandrie’s mother priya srinivasan., in an interview with the hindu, chandrie says, “i have always enjoyed watching films but this was my first solo film project. the silenced siren happened quite by chance. i was initially signing up for a theatre course, but ended up in the one on filmmaking, as the former was cancelled.”, the film which was shot in three weeks focuses on the city’s erstwhile textile mills, through a dialogue between the filmmaker and the film’s protagonist. shot on a basic dslr, the docu-film’s central character is chandrie’s chauffeur, the 76-year-old amarnath pandey more affectionately known as pandeyji. talking about pandeyji’s association with her family, chandrie says, “he’s been with us for 10 years and is a part of our family. not only does he drive me around, he also takes a parent-like interest in my academics. while he is happy about my film’s success, he always cautions me to not neglect my studies while attending festivals.”, before being employed with chandrie’s household, pandeyji had been driving taxis in mumbai for almost half a century. originally from a small town near allahabad, pandeyji’s long association with the city makes him a repository of local history and culture. for chandrie, who is currently studying in the 11th grade, pandeyji is quite the raconteur. this quality of his made him the obvious choice for the docu-film. she says, “pandeyji can really engage an audience with his compelling style of narration and vibrant tales. my friends have also been an audience to his stories while travelling with me.”, initially, chandrie wanted to make a film on the myriad changes in mumbai’s landscape in the last few decades. however, while looking at the raw footage from the initial shoots, chandrie, with the help of her mentor-filmmaker batul mukhtiar realised that much of pandeyji’s focus had been on the textile mills. and that is how she finally identified the focus of her film., chandrie admits, “i wasn’t aware of the history behind the textile mills of the city which have now been replaced with malls and industrial complexes. it is through pandeyji’s stories about the city that i learnt about them, and the topic intrigued me. this made me to research on the subject, which eventually helped me make this film.” the documentary looks back to the great bombay textile strike of the 80s, which had caused the city’s mills to shut down, leaving thousands of workers unemployed. pandeyji, who was a witness to this movement, recalls the plight of his friends and relatives during that time, in the film. chandrie also incorporated footage from the films division of india (fdi), which show the erstwhile textile mills in their heyday., it was while filling up forms at the fdi that chandrie came up with the title of her documentary. “i hadn’t named my film at the time, and procuring footage from the fdi required me to give it a name. the film’s current title is the one that came to me on the spur of the moment.” she says, “the mills used to have a siren which would go off four times a day, informing the mill workers of their work shifts. but with the closing down of the mills, this siren has been silenced forever.”",0.10136288608510828,celluloid conversations ex-taxi driver,"siya chandrie busy 17-year-old. first documentary film silenced siren ( 2015 ) going places. , already screened three festivals : 19th international children ' film festival india ( icffi ) , hyderabad november 2015 , kala ghoda arts festival ( kgaf ) february 2016 12th international association women radio &amp;

in comparison. however, the mismatch between the apparently rosy picture and stagnant employment statistics appears to have rattled the government. jobless growth is a nightmare that no government would like to face., in the end, the government needs to avoid the pitfalls of ad hoc tinkering with fdi norms, especially on taxation. nothing repels foreign investors more than unstable and fickle

2016-07-01,is fdi really a gift horse?,"in less than a year, the government of india has announced yet another set of “>radical changes” in foreign direct investment (fdi) policies. the earlier announcement in november 2015 introduced changes in 15 major sectors, and the latest announcement covers nine sectors., however, the thrust of the two sets of policy changes remains the same, namely to ease entry of foreign investors in india. last year’s announcement stated that the policy changes were intended to “ease, rationalise and simplify the process of foreign investments in the country and to put more and more fdi proposals on automatic route instead of government route where time and energy of the investors is wasted”, while the recent amendments “seek to further simplify the regulations governing fdi in the country and make india an attractive destination for foreign investors”., a more cogent explanation is, however, provided in the consolidated fdi policy that was unveiled just a fortnight earlier and which states: “it is the intent and objective of the government of india to attract and promote foreign direct investment in order to supplement domestic capital, technology and skills, for accelerated economic growth. foreign direct investment, as distinguished from portfolio investment, has the connotation of establishing a ‘lasting interest’ in an enterprise that is resident in an economy other than that of the investor.”, fdi in theory and practicenow that india has become “the most open economy in the world for fdi”, can the country expect to benefit from this form of investment?, we would begin by trying to understand whether fdi has retained its character of being long-term inflows of investible capital in an age when global capital markets are being ruled by investors having short-term targets. economists have always treated fdi as that component of foreign investment in an enterprise that confers “control” to the foreign investor over the enterprise. all other foreign investment was defined as portfolio investment, and this component was considered “footloose”. as regards the threshold for identifying whether an enterprise was foreign-controlled or otherwise, most countries adopted their own definitions. for instance, in the past, the reserve bank of india (rbi) followed the practice of identifying “foreign-controlled rupee companies”, which were companies having foreign shareholding of 25 per cent or more of total equity or where 40 per cent share is held by investors from a single country., in recent decades, the organisation for economic cooperation and development (oecd) and international monetary fund (imf) have pushed for a globally acceptable definition of fdi, according to which 10 per cent or more of foreign equity constitutes the “controlling share” in an enterprise. but not all countries have adopted the oecd-imf definition., for instance, in india all investments other than those through the stock market are reported as fdi. india, therefore, does not make any distinction between the “controlling share” and the others as far as fdi is concerned. this implies that data on fdi for india do not allow us to make the distinction between long-term investments and portfolio investments., foreign investors consider “controlling share” to be vital for bringing in state-of-the-art technologies. however, given the fact that developing countries have been struggling to get access to proprietary technologies despite steep increases in fdi inflows over time, there seems to be the proverbial slip between access to technology and fdi inflows., the oecd-imf duo introduced some other components in the definition of fdi, the most significant of these being the inclusion of reinvested earnings. while it may be justified for balance of payments purposes, the fact is that retained earnings increase the host country’s liabilities without actually transferring resources from abroad. retained earnings are a part of the profits earned by foreign companies in their host countries, which are in domestic currencies. once capitalised and absorbed in the equity stock, retained earnings become conduits for larger dividend remittances in future. further, if such earnings are used to take over domestic companies or to buy back shares from the public, then they would not add to the existing capacities. data provided by the un conference on trade and development (unctad) show that the share of reinvested earnings has increased progressively during the recent past and by 2013 they constituted two-thirds of the fdi outflows from the developed countries. in fact, more money was flowing into the developed countries as dividend income than that was flowing out as direct investment. thus actual cross-border equity flows that meet the conventional definition of fdi are only a fraction of the reported global fdi flows.",0.07183828076685217,fdi really gift horse ?,"less year ,

2016-07-12,“india’s changed faster since 1991”,"if manmohan singh, given a full mandate by p.v. narasimha rao, became the prime architect of wide-ranging economic reforms, forced by a balance-of-payments crisis, that firmly put india on a new growth trajectory twenty-five years ago, he had men such as montek singh ahluwalia to assist him in the momentous exercise. as dr. singh subsequently went on to helm the united progressive alliance government, mr. ahluwalia took reins of the erstwhile planning commission, of which he was deputy chairman through the upa’s two terms in power. mr. ahluwalia walks down memory lane in an interview with puja mehra — looking back, and looking forward as india stares at the tailwinds of a sluggish world economy., the rescue team of 1991, of which you were a key member, made a giant leap of faith. there hasn’t been a crisis of the same order, but would you say you have seen as much boldness and courage in economic policy formulation in the 25 years since then?, as you say, the crisis of 1991 was exceptionally severe and it did require a quick and bold response. we are fortunate that dr. manmohan singh, backed by prime minister p.v. narasimha rao, acted quickly and boldly. he didn’t just act to control the crisis: he used the crisis as an opportunity to make far-reaching structural changes to transform a system that was designed in the mid fifties and sixties and had become quite unsuitable for the times. the problems with the system had been discussed earlier and there was general agreement in the technocracy about the need to reform industrial and trade policy, and the need for a greater role for the private sector and market forces. there was less agreement in the political class and especially not in the left., i agree we have not seen comparable boldness since then, but of course we have not had a comparable crisis. the good news is that the reforms have not been reversed by successive governments. on the contrary, they have been pushed forward. each government gives its own names to the programmes but a discerning person can see that it is essentially the same broad direction. there is nothing wrong with that. however, it does mean that there hasn’t been comparable boldness in charting out new structural changes that are now needed., how do you feel when you look around and see how much india today is different from the pre-1991 era?, of course, india has changed, radically, but you would expect that over twenty-five years. the question to ask is has it changed faster than in the twenty-five years before the reforms, and seen more progress than other countries?, there is no question it has changed much faster than it did in the preceding 25 years. the rate of growth of gdp between 1955 and 1990 was only around 4 per cent. per capita gdp grew at only 2 per cent per year. in the 25 years since the reforms gdp growth has averaged about 7 per cent and population growth has slowed down, which means per capita gdp growth has been close to 5.5 per cent. that’s a huge difference. a lot of the changes you see in the structure of the economy are a consequence of the fact that incomes are rising much faster and of course the economy is more open., poverty has declined much faster than in earlier years, though of course there are still too many people below the poverty line. more importantly, expectations have changed. the poor don’t just want to be pushed above the poverty line. they want better quality jobs, better access to essential services such as education and health and clean drinking water and sanitation. our performance in these dimensions needs to be greatly improved., comparing india’s performance with that of other countries shows that india’s growth was lower than that of other developing countries in the pre-reform period but it exceeded that of all developing countries except china taken together. china’s performance is clearly outstanding and in a different league., what is your most striking memory from the days of designing and implementing the 1991 reforms?, i am writing a book about my experiences which will have many memories. for now i would only say, as a poet put it, “bliss it was in that dawn to be alive, but to be young was very heaven.”, at that time, did it seem like you were rewriting the future of the country?, in government it is very easy to persuade yourself that you are rewriting the future. however, after much reflection i would certainly say that what was done in trade policy exchange rate management, industrial policy, tax reforms and capital market reforms were game changers. tax reforms are still ongoing, but that is normal., back then, dr. singh had said that his views on the pace of change had changed: “i used to be in favour of gradualism but look around and realise that time is not on our side. if there is to be structural reform it has to be done quickly.” and yet, he is said to have presided over, as prime minister, a state of “policy paralysis”. tell us about that phase., what you call policy paralysis refers i think to the problem of infrastructure projects being held up because of a piling up of environmental clearances, unresolved disputes in ppp public-private partnership cases, and financial constraints facing infrastructure investors because they did not anticipate the economic downturn and could not cope with cost escalations. this was definitely a problem and in the twelfth plan, which was approved towards the end of 2012, we had warned that the 8 per cent growth target depended on strong supportive policies and a “policy logjam” scenario would reduce growth to between 5 and 5.5 per cent. one of the reasons for the logjam was that ministries acted as silos with very little willingness to cooperate to find a solution. efforts were made to set up mechanisms to get effective cooperation across ministries, but things were soon overtaken by the elections. some of the problems relating to stalled infrastructure projects are still being addressed. i hope this will be done quickly., let me point out, however, that there are examples of effective policy handling also. we faced pressure on the rupee in 2013, after the current account deficit had widened to more than 4 per cent of gdp in the previous year (much higher than in 1990), and the “temper tantrum” led to a capital outflow, all of which put pressure on the rupee. we were able to handle that crisis without having to go to the imf international monetary fund thanks to the flexible exchange rate, which allowed a substantial exchange rate adjustment to occur automatically, a clear policy decision by the finance minister that the fiscal deficit would be brought under control, and very high reserves which implied that we could buy time for the policy measures to take effect. i would call this very deft policy handling. had we fumbled, the consequences would have been painful., former finance minister p. chidambaram has said that the fiscal stimulus rolled out by the upa government in the aftermath of the 2007-08 global financial meltdown ended up contributing to the economic pain. you were one of its architects…, i am sure mr. chidambaram did not describe me as the architect of the fiscal stimulus, since fiscal issues are handled by the finance ministry. however, let me say i was in favour of an initial stimulus to counter the impact of the crisis. that was the right thing to do then, and indeed it is what the g20 were recommending generally. however, having protected gdp growth in 2009-10, the stimulus should have been withdrawn by 2010. i was certainly not in favour of open-ended stimulus. had we started withdrawing in 2010-11, we would have been in much better shape from a macroeconomic perspective in the next three years., the planning commission, prime minister manmohan singh had said at its final meeting, was in need of reinventing itself. in what ways was the need for the commission to contemporise itself felt?, all institutions should periodically rethink their purpose. dr. manmohan singh wanted us to ponder on what an institution like the planning commission should do to support government policy in the new economic environment. i had submitted a detailed note to the prime minister in the last months of upa-ii but i said action could be left to the next government., one of the suggestions i made was that the commission should do more to provide an internal but independent critique of the sector policies and individual programmes implemented by the ministries. traditionally the planning process had focussed too much on funding plan and not enough on general sector policy, or even on scientific evaluation of the effectiveness of plan programmes. however, to do a good job the commission has to be able to draw on professionals with domain knowledge and not just on generalist civil servants drawn from the same pool as the ministries. in the pre-reform era, about 80 per cent of the knowledge on most things was within the government and only 20 per cent outside. today, it is the reverse. this is especially so as the private sector now has an active presence in all critical areas. we had no way of tapping outside expertise in a systematic manner. we did set up committees and consultative groups, but that is not the same thing as having experts on the staff. i did move a proposal to allow each member a budget of rs.2 crore, to hire outside consultants in any of their areas. they welcomed the initiative, but later complained that the administrative procedures for selecting the consultants were so complex that they could not cope! one of the newspapers even reported that the amount was too large., it’s been over a year since the niti aayog replaced the planning commission. it’s early days still for the aayog but is it, in your view, addressing those gaps and the need of the day?, as you say, it is early days, and i do not know what exactly they are doing. all i would like to say is that i wish niti aayog well. we are entering a very critical period, with considerable global uncertainty. solid analysis and critical advice on policy can make a big difference. and that i understand is the terms of reference of the niti aayog., concerns have been expressed about the central statistical organisation’s gdp and gross value added estimates, including by mr. chidambaram. there are doubts if an industrial turnaround has indeed taken place. commentators are saying that india’s growth doesn’t feel as good on the ground as the data suggest. where do you stand in this debate? what disconnect could there be between the statistical estimates and the reality on the ground?, it is not just mr. chidambaram who has expressed doubts. the economic survey itself has expressed puzzlement, so clearly there are unresolved issues. these are mainly on the growth of manufacturing where the new data give a higher growth rate than the earlier indicators would suggest. i thought a committee under pronab sen had been appointed to go into these issues. they should release the report as soon as possible. the cso should also come out as quickly as possible with a time series going back several years using the new method and comparing the result with the older series., now that china has slowed down, our growth rate is higher than china. observers are already saying that even china’s reduced growth rate exaggerates the actual growth. if china’s growth data are being questioned, there will be similar scrutiny of our data, and we would be well advised to share whatever information we have as quickly as possible., the indian economy is said to be an island of relative calm in a gloomy global scenario. mainly domestic engines propel it and it has remained relatively insulated from global shocks. can it remain so? is india a largely domestic story?, it is true that we are not dependent on an export-led growth process where expanding exports and a growing export surplus provide the demand that will support growth. but that does not mean we are somehow insulated from global shocks. we are much more open than we were and therefore what happens elsewhere matters to us. in fact, right now we are benefiting from a positive global shock in terms of low oil prices, though this shock has now bottomed out., i do agree that india’s growth will depend upon domestic factors, notably a big push in infrastructure and a revival in private investment. however this will involve an increase in import and we will need better export performance to manage the balance of payments. fdi is also important for modernising technology in indian industry and possibly also linking indian production to global supply chains. that in turn has implications for trade negotiations. all this means there are many things we have to do to manage our interactions with the global economy well. we would ignore the global economy only at our peril., bharatiya janata party mp subramanian swamy ran a campaign against dr. raghuram rajan, which, it is widely believed, is one of the reasons that led him to announce he will not be seeking a second term at the reserve bank of india. many people say he was “hounded out” by the bjp. would you like to say something about dr. rajan’s stint in india and the manner of his departure?, i do not know what led dr. rajan to announce that he would be rejoining academia at the end of his term. however, i have no doubt that this is a great loss for india’s economic management team. dr. rajan has been an outstanding governor, and has commanded a great deal of respect internationally. this is actually an asset for the country since a central bank governor who commands respect gives credibility to policy pronouncements. he managed the crisis of 2013 extremely well and also started many things in the area of financial and monetary reform which need to be completed as quickly as possible., is the worst yet to come from china?, there is a lot of nervousness internationally about china’s economic prospects in the near future. they were expected to slow down from the very high rates of growth they recorded in the past thirty years and initially, the slowdown to 6.5 per cent was regarded as commendable. the trouble is, people are now wondering whether china’s growth is lower than that, some say even as low as 4.5 per cent. if it is that low it will generate internal tensions in terms of insufficient growth of employment opportunities. china was able to maintain high growth after the crisis because of a credit-led boom feeding investment in real estate which has led to a number of what are now called ghost towns. this is clearly not sustainable and the traditional chinese growth engine, which used to be exports, is unlikely to recover soon given the poor prospects in the advanced countries. one can never be sure, but it is reasonable to say there is no upside and quite a lot of downside. poor performance in china will obviously have ripple effects on others., what does brexit tell us — will the european experiment succeed or fail? what are the economic implications?, brexit was a surprise, although the polls were all pointing in that direction. many of the underlying tensions that caused brexit, especially a frustration with the soothing noises being made by the elite for several years which did not lead to visible improvements for the common man, are being felt in other european countries also. and immigration touches a raw nerve everywhere. i do not know whether the u.k.’s exit is now inevitable. the new prime minister will have to take a call and it is possible that they may push the decision to a general election. it is too early to judge whether the european experiment will be irreversibly damaged but in the short run, there will be more uncertainty. i don’t see any positive economic implications and one can imagine seriously negative ones.",0.10818706627541214,“india ’ changed faster since 1991 ”,"manmohan singh , given full mandate p.v. narasimha rao , became prime architect

2016-07-15,‘india is not an outlier on ftas’,"doing business: “what i have a problem with is, when we india take care of our national interest by protecting our industry and service sector, the u.s. says we are obstructive….” — photo: kamal narang | photo credit: kamal narang , commerce and industry minister nirmala sitharaman retained her portfolio in the recent cabinet reshuffle despite criticism on falling exports, and the slow progress in negotiations on free trade agreements (ftas). in an interview to suhasini haidar and arun s., she defended her approach on ftas, and explained why she doesn't think she has suffered for want of being a cabinet minister., excerpts:, there is a sense that india is reticent about concluding negotiations on ftas, whether it is with australia, canada, new zealand or the european union (eu). that the commerce ministry is slowing down the process., not at all. india is not against concluding any fta talks. but let’s not forget what has been happening in the last two years. for instance, with canada, when both sides were keen to go ahead with the talks, canada was going through a process of elections. so the fta talks got held up. unfortunately, australia is a similar example. the eu did not have an election, but brexit was occupying their minds. let us see the global context. in the last two years, except the trans pacific partnership, and one, say vietnam with russia, tell me of any fta signed anywhere else. globally, trade was growing slower than the world output. the economies of countries such as brazil and russia are contracting. there is devaluation of currencies. so if that is the case, and ftas are not being signed anywhere else, it’s not as if the fta talks involving india stand out as an outlier., regarding the regional comprehensive economic partnership (rcep) negotiations, you had hotly contested the hindu’s story that countries involved were unhappy with india’s so-called obstructionist stance. give us a sense of the rcep negotiations and whether they will be actually concluded., in the rcep, we have made our initial offers for goods, we have made our offers for services. we gave a layered approach to it. the third layer, and a very important layer, is with those countries, like china, australia and new zealand, with whom india does not have an fta. as it is, without an fta, you know the impact of chinese exports to india. for me, representing india, as much as i can give, i need reciprocal things to be given to me. if i am willing to offer tariff concessions on goods, i want something to be offered by them to boost india’s services., the u.s. is threatening trade sanctions against india over poultry import restrictions, after india lost the case at the world trade organisation (wto). are you worried?, on the sanctions, i think we should put it in perspective. a certain notification was expected from the animal husbandry department in india after the wto case went against us. for whatever reason, the notification came a day after the u.s. thought we didn’t keep up the deadline. the notification has come now, so i’m sure that the u.s. will take note of it, and there wouldn’t be a basis for any sanctions., meanwhile, cairn energy has just reportedly claimed a whopping $5.6 billion compensation from the indian government in a tax dispute alleging that india has “failed to uphold its obligations” under the u.k.-india bilateral investment treaty (bit). what is your view on such investor-state disputes?, issues related to investor-state disputes are a matter of serious concern. it is something which we have to apply our minds to. ultimately a bit cannot lead to a situation where companies which make losses for some reason can pull up the sovereign state and say you have to pay up for the loss., india dragged the u.s. to the wto dispute settlement body over the us’ move to hike fee for h1b and l1 temporary work visas. despite this, a bill has been introduced in the u.s. now to prohibit firms, including from india, from hiring employees on h1b and l1 visas. have the discussions with the us on the issue failed totally?, i don’t see it as a case of negotiations failing. what i have a problem with is, when we (india) take care of our national interest by protecting our industry and service sector, the u.s. says we are obstructive. shouldn’t india too, like other countries, protect its national interests? when they (u.s.) do it including by tightening their visa regime, they say it is to take care of their service sector and jobs., are you open to considering fdi in multi-brand retail? a recent us state department review said india is slow to propose reforms that match its rhetoric, and that india’s gdp numbers may be overstated., on fdi in multi-brand retail, we (bjp-led nda) won the general elections two years ago based on our manifesto which did not favour such a move. so we will stick to that. on gdp figures, india’s chief statistician has said the numbers are trustworthy. if some are some talking about why the figures are wrong, there are many others who are talking about why the figures are right., most crucial economic ministries, including that of commerce and industry, are now led by only ministers of state (mos) unlike in the upa and vajpayee regimes when these portfolios were held by cabinet-ranked ministers. do you think nda government under prime minister narendra modi has demoted these ministries including yours?, absolutely not. all mos holding independent charge like me have the benefit of the 360-degree picture which you feel only cabinet ministers benefit from. it is not necessary that mos with ic attend just those cabinet meetings where only the policy decisions concerning our ministries come up. there have been situations where even when a cabinet meeting did not have issues concerning my ministry on the agenda, i have been asked to attend just to look into what is happening because it had some implications on the issues related to my ministry or on the larger economy. so in that sense, mos with ic have never been denied the benefit of being there for such decisions. i don’t think i have suffered for want of being a cabinet minister. i don’t have a cabinet minister to whom i report. i report directly to the prime minister., india received record foreign direct investment (fdi) inflows in fy’16, but mostly from mauritius and singapore; and a significant portion of the total inflows have gone into the services sector and not into the manufacturing sector. are you worried?, i am not worried about fdi coming in mostly from mauritius and singapore. the inflows are not hot money coming in and going out quickly after earning short-term profits. foreign investors are keen to stay put here and see that manufacturing happens here. the investment may start off with the services sector and branch out to manufacturing. there is a great deal of interest from many top notch global manufacturers who want to manufacture in india. for instance, russia was the first to respond to our ‘make in india’ call by showing interest in nuclear energy and defence, besides companies like lockheed martin and foxconn. chinese companies making components are also coming in to places like pune. so manufacturing is getting fdi, but for it to get captured under statistics and joint ventures and so on is taking time. invest india (government’s investment promotion and facilitation agency) has been fairly busy. they are taking schemes like make in india to various states and helping companies in making investments at the right place. i don't think all the fdi is only going to services. there is a movement towards investing in manufacturing. people are looking for jv partners who match up to their scale and size., according to data from your ministry, the proposed investment (in india) has fallen from rs 4 lakh crore in 2014 to rs 3.1 lakh crore in 2015. is there a concern there?, investment is happening, but you can always pick up a random statistic and say that investments have dropped. it does not show the full picture. otherwise why will india be receiving so much fdi? where ever we go overseas, the first thing we hear is that at least your economy is stable, the macro fundamentals are consistent and the inflation is kept fairly under control in the last two years. you may still want to talk about price rise in pulses and the seasonal fluctuation that happens in fruits and vegetables. but largely, let us agree that it is not a situation which developed today. so it is not right to look at those indicators and say that the retail inflation is hitting growth. it was higher than now when the nda government came in. food inflation was also higher. now at least we have brought it down to around 5 per cent. manufacturing growth is also going up, so there are definitely green shoots appearing., boosting exports is among your ministry’s key objectives, but shipments have fallen for 18 consecutive months. yet you are drawing this pretty picture about the economy. isn’t the contraction in exports one of your biggest concerns?, yes it is. but i am not trying to create a picture which is untrue. what i am trying to say is when we are talking of fdi and the interest of investors in india, the negatives are spoken as though the investors are not bothered about whether the negatives are true, and as though the fdi which is coming in is forgetful or is ignoring the negatives. if that were true, would those investors invest so much? people see india as a growing economy under a steady leadership. if the export sector had also grown, it would have been even better. but it is not that a fall in exports has shaken the confidence of investors. i am not denying that there are problems and exports have fallen. we have had extensive consultations with every export sector, and not once have i heard anybody tell me that exports are suffering because of our policies. they have conceded that global situation is bad. commodity prices are coming down, and there is currency volatility. currency fluctuation is becoming the order of the day rather that an exception. exporters are suffering, but they have said that the hand holding that the government is doing has helped., to another issue in the news: you spoke about building buffer stocks of pulses of eight lakh tonnes. tell us about where you see the country’s pulses policy going because the shortfall is quite high., in the last year, for both kharif and rabi, the minimum support price (msp) for the pulses has been increased. the worrying factor is, in the last two years, the output of pulses in india has fallen, and with our consumption being a steady 22-23 million tonnes (mt), what we were growing was about 17 mt, and it has now fallen to around 15 mt, which is itself worrying. in the short term we have spoken to myanmar, mozambique, tanzania, and canada. so, this eight lakh tonnes will be met by procuring both from indian farmers and the importers. that stock will only be released as and when we think the prices are going up., that you are looking at these msps and that you are building a larger buffer stock than anyone had ever expected, will it contravene the wto norms?, wto allows you to give msp for those stated commodities, and pulses are in that list. so we are not violating any of the wto compliances. second, the stocks that we hold, of wheat and rice is not to distort the market, we are only trying to help indian buyers of dal, who can’t purchase it at rs 200 per kg. above all, when the country is running short of a particular item, we have to import. so i consciously keep my wto compliances in my mind, when we are talking about pulses., soon after the nda government under modi took over, it focused on getting the land acquisition bill passed by parliament. in hindsight, do you think your government wasted precious time on that and ended up getting a ‘suit-boot ki sarkar’ (pro-rich and pro-corporate) tag, instead of focusing immediately on other reforms to attract investment and generate employment?, it was not a waste of time, it was an effort taken. we tried everything to ensure the passage of the bill, but there was no cooperation from the congress party. it was the congress which wasted everybody's time by engaging in nitpicking on something that essentially was their bill. it was the congress which tired to give us the ‘suit-boot ki sarkar’ tag, but it did not stick. if any government has worked for the poor, it is ours and i can give you any number of examples on the measures we have taken for the poor. so repeating the term ‘suit-boot ki sarkar’ without much of a basis is not going to help the congress., but land availability is not a major problem for the industry. in special economic zones (sez) alone, around 33000 hectares is lying unused. with hardly any investor interest in sezs now, how are you going to ensure productive use of the vacant land?, on sezs, it is necessary to put facts in context. acquisition of those huge tracts of land was not done during the nda regime under modi. extensive land was acquired for sezs during the upa regime. it was also the upa that brought in minimum alternative tax (mat) and dividend distribution tax (ddt) undermining the sez concept itself. sezs became not so fashionable due to mat and ddt. it had nothing to do with modi or nda. we are now looking at what best we can do to revive the sezs, whether by linking it with dta (or domestic tariff area, the area in the country outside the sezs) or by seeing if the non-processing area (meant for sez supporting infrastructure area like schools, hospitals and hotels) and centres in that area can be used for other purposes that can help the sezs., passage of the goods and services tax bill is crucial for the success of the upcoming monsoon session of parliament and to ensure higher gdp growth. with issues like the supreme court ruling on arunachal pradesh and kashmir violence likely to dominate the session, how confident are you of parliament nod for the gst bill?",0.06327133995758158,‘india outlier ftas ’,"business : “what problem , india take care national interest protecting industry service sector , u.s. says obstructive

2016-07-28,fooled by smartness,"illustration: keshav | photo credit: keshav , the smart cities mission is a flagship programme of the ruling national democratic alliance. >one year after its official launch, while expectations have been scaled down, the rhetoric has largely escaped political scrutiny., generally, the term ‘smart city’ denotes networked informatics writ large on a cityscape. there are, however, few examples of cities built to ‘smart’ specifications. the most famous are new songdo city in south korea, masdar city in the uae, and planit valley in portugal. but these are more brand ambassadors of the smart city ideal than living embodiments., the vast majority of so-called smart cities are the same old cities but >with a ‘smart solution’ tacked on. this could be, say, the layering of data capture devices such as sensors and cctv cameras over existing infrastructure to create a ‘smart’ grid. the ‘smartness’ is derived from the data captured by the sensors and analysed by algorithms to aid decision-making in real time., but the really smart thing about ‘smart solutions’ is that once installed, it makes the city permanently dependent on the private service provider, much like how your dependence on your smartphone is far greater, and of many dimensions, than it ever was with your non-smartphone. whether or not an urban problem is solved by a smart city project, a market would have been created., in other words, smart city projects have a lot to do with opening up municipal services to private capital. but that’s not all. there is also a broader agenda at work. the first clue to the nature of this agenda lies in the origin of the smart city idea itself., seven segment divisionunlike what one might expect, the ‘smart city’ concept did not originate in the field of urban design or city planning. the american urbanist adam greenfield traces its earliest usage to a bunch of technology firms. ibm, with its ‘smarter planet’ campaign, was one of the first movers. so was cisco with its smart+connected communities initiative, siemens with its citycockpit, and microsoft with its citynext programme., this raises an obvious question: is it possible that the push for smart cities in india has anything at all to do with market creation? the consultancy firm frost and sullivan estimates the global smart city market to be worth $1.56 trillion by 2020. it divides the smart city market into seven segments: smart governance and education, smart security, smart energy, smart infrastructure, smart mobility, smart healthcare, smart building., the government of india, too, in its parliamentary reference note on smart cities, identifies six characteristics of a smart city: smart governance, smart mobility, smart people, smart economy, smart environment and smart living. while not quite market segments, the otherwise vaguely worded document’s sudden descent into definitional clarity makes the business connection explicit: “smart cities are those that are able to attract investments.”, the smart dynamic in indiau.s. deputy secretary of commerce bruce andrews captured this sentiment perfectly in his speech at the smart cities summit in mumbai this year: “i am joined today by representatives from 18 leading american environmental technology companies, all of whom are looking for new business opportunities in india’s growing infrastructure market.”, debates about the smart city in the west tend to focus more on the dangers posed by digital colonisation of the analog cityscape. these include fears about loss of privacy, the rise of a surveillance society, and the possibilities of authoritarianism unleashed by the normalisation of biometric control. these concerns, while valid, do not fully capture the political dynamic of the smart city agenda in the indian context., to begin with, the problem with indian cities is not that they are ‘unsmart’ but that they are dysfunctional. making them functional entails expanding their infrastructure. to do so for every indian city would cost a sum of money the indian state will not spend. to do it for even one entire city would entail costs that no government will bear., and yet, without adequate infrastructure, foreign capital, which the indian state desperately seeks, will not come to india, or at least not in the volumes sought. but india needs foreign capital to upgrade its infrastructure. the smart city is the way out of this impasse. not the whole country, not the entire city, just one small area in select cities will get the infrastructure developed to first world specifications — and this is where the bulk of the smart city funds will go. the document which encapsulates government policy on smart cities, the smart city guidelines (scg), yields three obvious conclusions. one, there will be no big public investment in expanding urban infrastructure. two, the state will support the construction of smart city enclaves where businesses and smart (read: prosperous) citizens are welcome to create the kind of urban infrastructure they want, and for which they will pay from their own pocket. and three, the only kind of city-wide public investments would be those that satisfy at least one of two criteria: help create a market for ict (information and communications technology) service providers; are necessary to address security concerns., all this still doesn’t explain why we should aim for a ‘smart city’ and not ‘smart country’ or ‘smart state’. this brings us to the political core of the ‘smart city’ phenomenon, what’s come to be known as “institutional bypass”., over the past decade, democratic resistance to economic reforms have been getting stronger in countries around the world, prompting serious rethink on whether it is worth expending resources on pushing them at the level of national governments. perhaps a more efficient strategy would be to bypass the national government and go directly to the states. this was the idea behind competitive federalism. it was expected that while the centre cut public expenditure, states would be forced to compete with each other to attract fdi and implement pro-business reforms in a race to the bottom., but state governments, too, are tainted by democratic limitations. the need of the hour, therefore, was to create a whole new governance structure that would bypass both state and central governments, and insulate political decision-making from interference by any elected body whatsoever. enter smart cities, with its creepy little baby, smart governance., special purpose of the vehiclethe scg states that all smart city projects will be implemented (and the funds administered) by a special purpose vehicle (spv). the spv would be a company incorporated under the companies act, 2013. the state government and the urban local body (ulb) will be equal shareholders of this company. but the private sector can take equity stake in the spv. it is also possible for a private investor to be the biggest single shareholder of an spv, so long as the combined shareholding of the state government and the ulb is greater., along with transfer of financial control, the spv, to be headed by a ceo, is also a mechanism for transfer of political control. the scg calls for “delegating the rights and obligations of the municipal council with respect to the smart city project to the spv” as well as “delegating the decision-making powers available to the ulb under the municipal act/government rules to the chief executive officer of the spv.” the spv will even have the powers to collect taxes and surcharges, and enter into jvs and ppps. a city that has become a company with shareholders cannot but treat its citizens as anything other than sources of revenue., in the smart city proposals (scp) of the 33 cities that have been chosen so far, the bulk of proposed investments are earmarked for area-specific development, and not city-wide infrastructure. this is as per the scg mandate, and is a win-win for both foreign and domestic capital. the former gets a first world haven to operate from without having to contend with the nuisance of india’s unreliable infrastructure. the latter gets to park their funds in real estate with the certain knowledge that they can make a killing once the area is ‘smartified’., thus the smart city paradigm signals a momentous shift that takes the agenda of privatisation beyond the takeover of public utilities such as water supply or sanitation, and inaugurates the formal privatisation of governance itself. the tendency to focus exclusively on technology in discussions of smart cities can blind one to the real driver of the smart city paradigm — the global crisis of capital accumulation.",0.12114136690029545,fooled smartness,"illustration : keshav

2016-08-26,a better tomorrow,"in early 2004, home loan rates sank to a record low of under 7.5 per cent, thanks to the liberalisation of the indian economy. real estate investment was then an option only for the rich, but the low borrowing rates encouraged people from all income groups to step forward, which led to the average age of the indian home buyer dropping from late 50s to mid-20s., the opening up of fdi meant that the market then expanded at a never-before-seen rate, both size-wise and price-wise. in three years, prices were doubled, as were the number of constructions. and then, in 2008, it all came to a halt., the lehman debacle and the subsequent foundering of global economies were operative factors, but india’s real estate sector had also reached a stage from where it needed to mature., decline and correction, the slowdown was brought on by the sharp rise in property rates over the preceding years, and the rising number of investors—almost as many as end users in some cases. the result was a misleading demand assessment, and an adjustment was therefore only natural., today, however, real estate prices have corrected in most locations. office and retail segments were impacted, but the greatest need for correction was in the residential sector., this sector is more sensitive to non-amenable lending norms, and which also had seen the highest price appreciation., focus on affordable housing, we are now seeing a renaissance in the indian real estate sector, with retail and commercial spaces being more in tune with actual market demand dynamics. in the residential space, developers who had earlier focussed on luxury spaces for it/ites and hni buyers, have started launching housing projects for the common man., this development, however, is influenced by the overall performance of the economy. in the past, developers have reacted to growth in the market by diluting their focus on affordable housing and going back to luxury projects. that said, the incumbent government’s determined drive towards ‘housing for all by 2022’ has brought in several new incentives for developers and buyers of budget housing. this will ensure that a good cross-section of indian builders will retain their focus on affordable housing for at least a few more years., still, a demand-supply mismatch persists, and indicates that residential property prices will rise again, the first signs of which we are already witnessing. however, the market will not see the same fluctuation as it did a few years ago. the focus will continue to remain on affordable housing and mid-income housing in the residential sector; efficient buildings—in terms of both energy consumption and space utility—at locations with good infrastructure in the office sector; and well-researched expansion plans in the retail sector., impact of rera on realty, the passing of the long-pending real estate regulatory bill is an unequivocal victory for the indian realty sector. it will almost single-handedly revamp the way the sector works across the board, from developers, investors and end-users, to lending institutions, property consultants and brokers—and hopefully government agencies involved in the buying and selling of property too. it is by far the most decisive step taken towards transparency and the kind of standardised processes, procedures, and accountability guidelines that the industry requires to progress. this major reform will create a much-needed consumer rights protection umbrella for buyers, thereby increasing consumer confidence as well as creating lasting developer brands focussed on quality and timely delivery of their projects. during the next decade, we will see increased transparency, and the adoption of international best practices.",0.15397727272727274,better tomorrow,"early 2004 , home loan rates sank record low 7.5 per cent , thanks liberalisation indian economy. real estate investment option rich , low borrowing rates encouraged people income groups step forward , led average age indian home buyer dropping late 50s mid-20s. , opening fdi meant market expanded never-before-seen rate , size-wise price-wise. three years , prices doubled , number constructions. , 2008 , came halt. , lehman debacle subsequent foundering global economies operative factors , india ’ real estate sector also reached stage needed mature. , decline correction , slowdown brought sharp rise property rates preceding years , rising number investors — almost many end users cases. result misleading demand assessment , adjustment therefore natural. , today , however , real estate prices corrected locations. office retail segments impacted , greatest need correction residential sector. , sector sensitive non-amenable lending norms , also seen highest price appreciation. , focus affordable housing , seeing renaissance indian real estate sector , retail commercial spaces tune actual market demand dynamics. residential space , developers earlier focussed luxury spaces it/ites hni buyers , started launching housing projects common man. , development , however , influenced overall performance economy. past , developers reacted growth market diluting focus affordable housing going back luxury projects. said , incumbent government ’ determined drive towards ‘housing 2022 ’ brought several new incentives developers buyers budget housing. ensure good cross-section indian builders retain focus affordable housing least years. , still , demand-supply mismatch persists , indicates residential property prices rise , first signs already witnessing. however , market see fluctuation years ago. focus continue remain affordable housing mid-income housing residential sector ;

send a message to pakistan. also, given the fact that this saarc finance ministers’ meeting will soon be followed by the 19th saarc summit in pakistan in november this year, mr. jaitley should have attended the meeting., the saarc finance ministers’ conference highlighted key issues pertaining to regional economic integration and reiterated the commitment to establish a south asian economic union (saeu). the proposal to establish a saeu by 2020 was made way back in 1998 in a report prepared by the saarc group of eminent persons (sgep). the sgep report also proposed that as a precursor to saeu, a south asian customs union (sacu) should be established by 2015 whereby all south asian countries will maintain common tariff and non-tariff barriers on imports from all non-member countries. south asia is the fastest growing region in the world, according to the world bank, with economic growth projected to increase from 7.1 per cent in 2016 to 7.3 per cent in 2017. deeper economic integration will help sustain this growth rate by creating an integrated south asian market ensuring a free flow of goods, services and capital. close to two decades after the sgep report, and as we approach yet another saarc summit, it is imperative to critically assess the efforts made towards achieving economic integration., trade liberalisationthe south asian free trade area (safta), enforced exactly a decade back, has been hailed as an important milestone on the road to saeu. however, safta has, at best, made a very modest contribution in boosting intra-saarc trade. at the time of its adoption, all south asian countries decided to place many products in what is known as a ‘sensitive list’ to exclude them from tariff liberalisation. consequently, as a study shows, 53 per cent of intra-regional import trade was excluded from tariff liberalisation under safta in 2006., in 2012, under phase two of tariff liberalisation under safta, countries agreed to prune their sensitive lists. however, this trimming was not significant. for example, while india brought down the number of products in its sensitive list by 95 per cent for least developed countries (ldcs) of south asia (nepal, bhutan, bangladesh, and afghanistan), it reduced its sensitive list for non-ldc countries only by around 30 per cent. pakistan shortened its sensitive list for all countries by about 20 per cent. more is expected from the two biggest economies in the region., additionally, intra-saarc trade also suffers from complex non-tariff barriers, poor infrastructure, lack of connectivity and bureaucratic red tape at borders. this cumulatively increases the costs of doing trade in south asia. consider this: it takes 35 days for a container to go from delhi to dhaka because it has to go via colombo or even singapore whereas it can reach in five days if there is direct connectivity. the recently signed motor vehicles agreement between bhutan, bangladesh, india and nepal is expected to improve connectivity but only on the eastern side of south asia. no wonder, according to world bank, intra-saarc trade is even lower than 5 per cent of total trade whereas in east asia it is 35 per cent and in europe 60 per cent. similarly, trade in services in south asia is very low notwithstanding the signing of the saarc agreement on trade in services in 2010, aimed at liberalisation of trade in services., investment liberalisationan integral component of economic integration is investment liberalisation. despite its potential, south asia has failed to emerge as a prime destination for foreign investment. the world investment report, 2016, of the united nations conference on trade and development reveals that while fdi inflows to south asia increased from $36 billion in 2013 to $50 billion in 2015, it is significantly less compared to east and southeast asia where these numbers stand at $350 billion and $448 billion for 2013 and 2015, respectively. south asia’s share in world fdi inflows in 2015 stood at a meagre 2.9 per cent whereas east and southeast asia attracted 25 per cent of world fdi flows., a key characteristic of fdi inflows in east and southeast asia is the ever-increasing intra-regional fdi inflows. within the association of southeast asian nations (asean) region alone, intra-asean fdi accounts for 18 per cent of total fdi flows in the region. on the other hand, barring few success stories of indian garment companies investing in bangladesh, intra-saarc fdi is very low., arguably, a saarc investment treaty, on the lines of the asean investment agreement that has helped increase intra-asean investment, will help further intra-saarc fdi. in the just-concluded saarc finance ministers’ meeting, all countries renewed their commitment to finalise the investment treaty, which is pending since 2007. however, india adopting a new model bilateral investment treaty (bit) in 2015 has thrown a spanner in efforts to have a saarc investment treaty. india’s model bit offers limited protection to foreign investment and also limited means to enforce their rights. will india ask all countries to base the saarc investment treaty on the indian model? if that happens, the investment treaty will not have any noticeable impact on boosting intra-saarc fdi inflows., india should take the leadevidently saarc has struggled to achieve effective economic integration and thus denied to itself numerous economic benefits. saarc’s top leaders, when they meet in pakistan later this year, need to demonstrate the political will to walk swiftly on the road to deeper economic integration by at least ensuring that saarc becomes a duty-free area. india being the strongest economy in the region should take lead in this regard.",0.04458376714705827,coming

2016-09-12,labour’s love’s lost,"on september 2, 10 trade unions in india organised what was said to be >one of the largest labour strikes in history. an estimated 120 million workers took part. the unions were protesting against the government’s unwillingness to grant a 12-point charter of demands they had put forward. a year ago, unions had signalled their discontent by having a similar nation-wide strike., this year, one of the principal demands of the unions was an increase in the daily minimum wage for unskilled workers from rs.246 to rs.692. they rejected an increase in the wage to rs.350 offered by the government. some of their other major concerns were: proposed changes in labour laws; growing casualisation of labour; privatisation; and greater opening up to foreign direct investment (fdi)., future tense, present imperfectlabour is restive today. it is apprehensive about what the future bodes for itself. but it’s not as if labour militancy has gone up in recent years. on the contrary, man-days lost due to industrial disputes (lockouts and strikes) came down from 23.7 million in 2001 to 13 million in 2012 before rising to 19 million in 2013. these figures are considerably lower than those in the 1970s and 1980s., however, there is little doubt that organised labour in india, as in the rest of the world, sees itself as a loser in the changes unleashed by liberalisation and globalisation. it fears that if the government goes ahead with some of its proposed “reforms”, its losses will begin to mount., indian businesspeople as well as many economists have long clamoured for greater “flexibility” in labour laws, a euphemism for freedom to hire and fire. the industrial relations code bill, 2016, which is said to favour such flexibility, is due to be tabled in parliament in the near future. it is bound to evoke a strong reaction from unions as well as opposition parties., several economists say that rigid labour laws are the reason india has not generated enough jobs in the formal sector — only about 10 per cent of jobs are in the organised sector and the remaining 90 per cent in the unorganised sector. as large firms do not have the confidence that they can shed workers in adverse conditions, they do not wish to enter labour-intensive, low-skilled sectors. this is the reason india has not been able to replicate the chinese success in labour-intensive manufacturing., this argument may have well been overtaken by events in the global economy. many other low-cost economies have already positioned themselves in these sectors. automation in the west means that the window of opportunity in these sectors is fast closing. the idea that reforming labour laws will trigger a huge expansion in low-skilled manufacturing is thus highly suspect in today’s changed situation., the experience so farmoreover, the academic literature on the subject is not unambiguously in favour of easing labour laws as a means for hiring more labour. dismissal laws in france are more stringent than in india, but that did not come in the way of france’s prospering for over a century. china itself has made its labour laws more stringent so that they are comparable to those in india (except in special economic zones)., indeed, some of the literature suggests that giving workers greater protection helps increase productivity by giving workers more incentives to invest in firm-specific skills. along with collective bargaining, worker protection leads to more egalitarian outcomes in society. there is also evidence that the bias against workers in indian industry may have more to do with tax incentives for capital than with restrictive labour laws., a second issue that agitates unions is the growing trend towards casualisation of labour. this was one of the reasons for labour unrest at maruti’s plant >at manesar in haryana last year., companies find it expedient to employ labour on contract. they can then leave the job of managing regulations and inspectors to the contract labour firms. they can also stay small and escape various labour regulations. most importantly, contract labour tends to be cheaper in general; at maruti’s manesar plant, contract workers earned less than half the wages of permanent workers., contract labour is a serious assault on workers’ rights. the supreme court has made strong observations on companies’ resort to contract labour in order to avoid statutory obligations. the economic survey (2015-16) believes that contract labour is merely a corporate response to “regulatory cholesterol”. however, reducing worker protection in the organised sector may not be the answer — many firms would still prefer the contract option simply because it’s cheaper. rather, we must extend worker protection and benefits to contract labour as well., privatisation and fdi are other areas of concern for organised labour. it is not that we have seen major initiatives to sell off psus. but there are clear attempts to further shrink the role of the public sector. public sector banks (psb), for instance, have been starved of capital and many banks are today without chairmen and managing directors. moves have also been initiated to merge psbs. unions see these moves as impacting jobs in the formal sector adversely., in principle, fdi should mean more investment and more job creation. however, in a situation where domestic firms have weakened by inadequate growth, fdi is seen as displacing jobs in domestic firms., it’s the jobsthe proposed labour reforms seek to weaken worker protection at a time when the indian economy is not creating enough jobs and the right kind of jobs. the rate of growth of employment slumped from 2.8 per cent in 2000-05 to 0. 5 per cent in 2011-12. in the same period, the labour force grew at 2.9 per cent and 0.4 per cent, respectively. in the organised sector, the share of informal employment rose from 48 per cent in 2004-05 to 54.6 per cent in 2011-12.",0.1356368802665099,labour ’ love ’ lost,"september 2 , 10 trade unions india organised said >one largest labour strikes history. estimated 120 million workers took part. unions protesting government ’ unwillingness grant 12-point charter demands put forward. year ago , unions signalled discontent similar nation-wide strike. , year , one principal demands unions increase daily minimum wage unskilled workers rs.246 rs.692. rejected increase wage rs.350 offered government. major concerns : proposed changes labour laws ;

at maruti’s manesar plant, contract workers earned less than half the wages of permanent workers., contract labour is a serious assault on workers’ rights. the supreme court has made strong observations on companies’ resort to contract labour in order to avoid statutory obligations. the economic survey (2015-16) believes that contract labour is merely a corporate response to “regulatory cholesterol”. however, reducing worker protection in the organised sector may not be the answer — many firms would still prefer the contract option simply because it’s cheaper. rather, we must extend worker protection and benefits to contract labour as well., privatisation and fdi are other areas of concern for organised labour. it is not that we have seen major initiatives to sell off psus. but there are clear attempts to further shrink the role of the public sector. public sector banks (psb), for instance, have been starved of capital and many banks are today without chairmen and managing directors. moves have also been initiated to merge psbs. unions see these moves as impacting jobs in the formal sector adversely., in principle, fdi should mean more investment and more job creation. however, in a situation where domestic firms have weakened by inadequate growth, fdi is seen as displacing jobs in domestic firms., it’s the jobsthe proposed labour reforms seek to weaken worker protection at a time when the indian economy is not creating enough jobs and the right kind of jobs. the rate of growth of employment slumped from 2.8 per cent in 2000-05 to 0. 5 per cent in 2011-12. in the same period, the labour force grew at 2.9 per cent and 0.4 per cent, respectively. in the organised sector, the share of informal employment rose from 48 per cent in 2004-05 to 54.6 per cent in 2011-12.",0.1356368802665099,labour ’ love ’ lost,"september 2 , 10 trade unions india organised said >one largest labour strikes history. estimated 120 million workers took part. unions protesting government ’ unwillingness grant 12-point charter demands put forward. year ago , unions signalled discontent similar nation-wide strike. , year , one principal demands unions increase daily minimum wage unskilled workers rs.246 rs.692. rejected increase wage rs.350 offered government. major concerns : proposed changes labour laws ;

2016-09-26,the middle class as a tool of economics,"the recent announcement of the implementation of the seventh central pay commission (cpc) recommendations was received on expected lines. the media made it out to be an extravaganza for a bloated and inefficient bureaucracy bereft of any linkage between performance and remuneration. on the other hand, government employees felt it fell short of expectations — as is usually the case with any kind of pay hikes. , but the government has a good economic reason to push the increased salaries into the economy: to push up the demand curve and bring about a spurt in expenditure. the increase in salaries is likely to bring in about rs. 1.02 lakh crore into the economy, of which about a fourth is likely to be consumed by taxes. the remaining amount would create demand in the sectors that would benefit; apart from retail and fmcgs, these are automobile and real estate. the main beneficiary of this increase is the middle class that is still predominantly interested in government jobs. , after the cpc in all probability the state governments will follow suit. thus funds would be released to the middle class that would in turn create demand by becoming consumers for all the economic activity unleashed on account of additional disposable income in their hands., here the middle class is used as a lever to jack up economic activity, and it is not the first time this has been done. though there is nothing wrong with it, this has had its fair share of trials and tribulations over the seven decades of independent india. we can see how it has since evolved., independence was a dream-come-true but it came along with the big blow of partition. the nascent nation found itself facing the onerous task of building itself, its fragmented polity and the tattered economy. but the post-independence euphoria was under the spell of idealism, symbolised by the egalitarianism embedded in the theories of socialism and communism. the emerging economies of that time were impressed by the centralised and controlled structures instituted by that thinking to shake the economy in a manner beneficial to all. indian politicians were no exceptions and took ideas from the controlled economies of the ussr and emerged upon planning our economy in a manner that combined the advantages of socialism and capitalism. we ended up having a mixed economy where initially the focus was more on planning and government spending. this era marked the beginning of the planning commission, further continued under the aegis of professor mahalanobis (from the second five-year plan onwards), and we saw different five-year plans being formulated and implemented. the first five-year plan was focussed on agriculture, followed by the second, which emphasised on industrialisation with public spending, that gave rise to many public sector undertakings. these plans were subsequently followed by the third, fourth, so on, but over a period of time the planning commission lost its sting and was becoming more of an advisory body whose suggestions were only selectively heard., the mixed economy implied equal partnership of the public sector and the private sector. however, the government played the lead role and the private sector the second fiddle. thus, the major task of shaping the economy was taken over by the government by taking unto itself its planning, direction and focus., for a planned economy, the government needs to have adequate funds at its disposal so that it can channel those in the sectors which it intends to develop. the government in the initial years tried to arrange these funds through the following means: (i) borrowing from foreign institutions, (ii) raising public debt, (iii) incentivising the public to save by offering bonds and such-like, (iv) printing more money, and (v) collecting taxes., in the decade of the 1950s, the funds arranged in thus were spent on ambitious projects that prime minister jawaharlal nehru called the temples of modern india. however, the pace of industrialisation and the euphoria of independence were short-lived. over a period of time the bureaucratic red-tapism inherited from the british era took over and the pace of progress was hampered. the public undertakings, where huge amounts of capital and manpower were at stake, got mired in corruption. there were long delays in their completion. there were abnormal gestation periods and they virtually were not able to deliver what they were intended for. these huge losses in the public sector, where there was hardly any accountability, meant loss of precious capital that was arranged through foreign funds, public debt raised at higher rate of interest, and printing more money. , all that meant there was every chance of the economy getting imploded by its own projects that had that become unviable — which is what eventually happened to most of them. the situation became very critical and it was realised that the public debt that was raised for these projects was basically from the middle classes who are tempted into savings by offering higher rates of interest in their savings account and also by incentivising them through a variety of government bonds with attractive interest rates. because the projects had not delivered, the only recourse left to the government for doing good the public debt was by printing more currency. this tendency of warding off public debt by printing more currency had an inflationary impact because more money was chasing fewer goods on account of failure of the public sectors to deliver. even the other recourse available of borrowing from foreign institutions had its own perils in non-repayment of loans. the interest burden of these institutions on the government started creating pressure on the expenditure side. with governmental revenues not being able to meet the expenditure, the fiscal deficit increased year on year, taking the government towards a situation of insolvency., the major burden of contributing to the public exchequer had always been on the fragile shoulders of the middle class. agricultural income was exempt from taxes and the taxes on the private sector were so high that either there was massive tax evasion or they were availing of tax incentives wherever offered. with the tax rates being as high as 90 per cent, there was a huge deterrence to private enterprise. so there was either large-scale tax evasion, or businesses were centred on sectors offering tax incentives. all this meant the taxes were collected from the salaried class, professionals or small or middle enterprises largely comprising of the indian middle class. the public debt was also collected mostly through the middle class by incentivising them by offers of treasury bonds such as national savings certificates and kisan vikas patras. even the offer of high deposit rates in the banks, once they were nationalised, was a means of tempting the middle class to save money rather than spending it. thus, the economy was intentionally made a savings-driven economy where the major chunk was to be used by the government to develop sectors that would kick-start the economy and provide the benefits to all. the assumption was that once the projects started delivering, everything else will fall in place. , however, the projects did not come up to expectations, and there was a major rethink on the future of the economy that started appearing to be in a shambles towards the late-1980s. this failure had a major impact on the middle class, which was bearing the burden of this development. in india there is no social security as there is in some western economies. earlier the undivided joint family used to be a sort of social security but with nuclear families becoming the norm post-independence, this social security also disappeared. the only recourse left to the middle class was to fend for itself. and since savings was in vogue in those days, the salaried persons, professionals and others planned for their retirement on the basis of the interest rates offered by banks. in the 1970s and 1980s, interest rates on fixed deposits ranged from 10 to 15 per cent and people were happy to have their money deposited in banks and make a living from the interest accruing on the deposits in the twilight years of their life., however, with the increasing fiscal deficit and with the government being unable to balance its expenditure with revenue, it was gradually moving towards bankruptcy. meanwhile, during the late-1980s most of the centralised economies of the world such as the ussr and yugoslavia were breaking up. the obsession with centralised economies was over and the spell of socialism was in for a major jolt. in india also there was the realisation among the planners that perhaps the fate of the planned economy is now sealed and therefore it is time to give a chance to market forces to revive the beleaguered economy. it is a matter of regret that in the early-1990s the fiscal deficit of the government had reached a level where there were hardly any funds to import petroleum products. it was nearly a crisis when the government was required to mortgage its gold reserves to raise needed funds. all this was a consequence of not being able to manage public funds towards the required goals and thus falling far short of expectations. things virtually came to the verge of an economic collapse. thus, the savings-driven economy where the government was the spearhead of giving direction and impetus came to a standstill and under the influence of world bank, the international monetary fund and others, india had to resort to opening up its economy to the market forces. then started the era of liberalisation, privatisation and globalisation (lpg), unleashed in 1993 by the then prime minister and finance minister duo of p.v. narasimha rao and manmohan singh., this era of lpg envisaged that capital and funds, instead of being vested with the government be made available to the market forces, that is, the private players, and the norms and regulations be liberalised for private enterprise to flourish. the strangulating hold of permits and quotas was to pave the way for an open environment bringing together the forces of demand and supply for an efficient and effective market where their benefits are shared by the consumer and the producer. , again, the genesis of any economic activity is finance, and the same is even more true in a market economy. it may be seen that most of the savings were blocked in the bank accounts of individuals and government bonds, and with the interest rates being tempting, there was no incentive to part with the savings. this implied that if the funds are not to be made available to private players, then these funds would have to be had at the prevailing savings bank or fixed deposit rates. this in turn meant that capital would be too costly for private players and it was a big disincentive for private players to go for public funds. the market model functions on the premise of free trade with consumers and suppliers interacting in the marketplace. the consumers need to spend and suppliers need to service the demand. for such interaction to take place, the funds need to come out of the closet. , the savings habit espoused so far was therefore not to be encouraged. thus, another rethink was to move the savings-driven economy towards a market-based, expenditure-driven economy, that is, to incentivise persons to spend rather than to save. figuratively it can be put as a transformation from a recurring deposit-person to an equated monthly instalment-person. there is a school of thought in economics that states that expenditure brings with it forward-and-backward linkages of economic activity that propel the economy. , the first step for this expenditure-driven economy was towards making the money, that is, finance, being made available to the players of the market at a reasonable rate. this was done by the stroke of the pen by slashing bank rates by about more than half for fixed deposits. it is strange but true that market forces were unleashed not by the market itself but by the government. even the savings bank account rates were reduced to about 3 per cent. this move suddenly made the savings and fixed deposit accounts non-lucrative vis-a-vis the prevalent rate of inflation — keeping money in banks over a period of time would mean its value depreciating in real terms. it was thought that the cheap and easy finance now available to the private sector would give the private sector adequate funds to kickstart the economy. the savings and fixed deposit accounts were no longer lucrative. incentives were given to channel the available money towards the capital market by way of incentivising investments in equity and share capital. during that time, many private enterprises came out with ipos or offers of investment in the capital markets promising huge returns that lured people to give them their savings. the money that goes to the equity market is available to the company at face value. there is an assurance to the investor of an uncertain but higher rate of return in future in the shape of dividends. also if the company does well, the value of the share appreciates in the secondary market., here again it could be seen that the money that came to be used by the big business houses was again being offered by the same middle class that was earlier being used by the government by offering them high interest rates. our middle class that does not have any social security buffer is on a constant and eternal search for some succour towards its latter stage of life. this time the hope had come from very tempting returns from investment in capital markets, from ipos, as well as secondary markets. but this phase of transition from a savings-driven economy to an expenditure-driven economy had its own share of victims, who were largely pensioners. many pensioners who retired in the late-1980s had planned their retirement life and their medical expenditures based on their pension coupled with interest earned from fixed deposits. however, suddenly one day in 1993, these savings were slashed remorselessly by more than a half. that upset their retirement plans and they were virtually in the doldrums. the avenues that were offered in lieu of bank accounts were mostly share markets and ipos that were beyond the comprehension of these senior citizens who had mostly spent their lives without any exposure to market forces. and wherever they tried to venture out to capitalise on the market forces by investing in share markets and ipos they had burnt their fingers in the various scams that have hit our share markets. many a time, it is infested with insider-trading. most of the small investors are eventually the losers and the bigger fish swell by devouring the smaller ones. whether any of the victims of these share-related scams that ran into thousands of crores of rupees have got their money back is anybody's guess., the rules and regulations of providing loans and extending capital were eased — meaning easy availability of credit, less strict underwriting and easier monitoring. and with funding costs already reduced by lowering the interest rate, there were business houses making a beeline for availing the opportunity. the banking industry in india has been a monopoly of public sector banks, and with the prodding of the government and different schemes unveiled, a large amount of funds could be made available to private players for investment in all aspects of the economy ranging from small retail businesses to industrial giants, infrastructure projects to big software companies. in a way, to give due credit to liberalisation, the software industry is a consequence of these policies. however, with reports emerging from banking sources regarding increasing non-performing assets (npas) that are nothing but bad loans, the same story of non-retrieval of money is perhaps repeated in the manner the public sector faltered earlier. , after nearly about two decades of liberalisation when the time has come to pay back the money even some prominent private players are found faltering before the financial institutions. as a consequence, most of the public sector banks have huge npas, that is, loans that are not being recovered. the extent of these npas at the national level stands at rs.5.91 trillion, which constitutes around 10.2 per cent of the total loans given (source: reserve bank of india, march 2013). when this kind of money stands locked and out of the system, again the burden of completing the money cycle falls upon the government by supporting the public sector banks. otherwise the base of the economy gets eroded. the government tries to do this by (a) re-capitalising the banks, (b) taking loans from foreign institutions, (c) allowing foreign direct investments, (d) raising tax rates or imposing more taxes. till now the government was trying to bridge this gap by again printing money, increasing the number of indirect taxes, thus again giving rise to inflation. mostly the middle class and the poorer sections of society take the hit. , on the other hand, you have much-feted big business tycoons who created their empires out of these loans and fled when it was time to pay back. and banks to their surprise found that their assets were not enough to clear the loans. the history of debt recovery from private enterprises is replete with all kinds of scams. there are many cases of bank officials colluding with private companies and extending dubious loans against over-invoiced machinery or over-priced property. the borrower goes incognito after repaying a few instalments, and banks end up with dud assets., the other impact was that many of these loans were invested in real estate and properties where the rate of appreciation is substantially higher than normal inflation. with more money chasing less property the rates of property soared and the middle class ended up as borrowers entrapped in the emi net. the builders then made money or ran away (there being no safeguards for the customer). builders having links with big business, politicians and bureaucrats remain out of reach. this way, even by not doing anything, these builders and business houses have multiplied their money and been able to beat the inflationary pressure. the middle class, which has either invested in the shares of these enterprises or whose funds have been channelled to these businesses through banks have borne the brunt of the inflation. if we see the real interest rate in this transaction (the rate of interest an investor, saver or lender receives or expects to receive after allowing for inflation) it will be observed that the big business houses have, in fact, availed money at negative interest. meanwhile, the middle class has lost money because their interest income is lesser than the inflation rate., none other than the former rbi governor, raghuram rajan, remarked on this situation: “we had gotten used to decades of moderate-to-high inflation, with industrialists and governments paying negative real interest rates and the burden of hidden inflation tax falling on the middle-class saver and the poor.”, coming to the current situation it can be seen that government spending has drastically come down (more by the concerns of fiscal deficit) and the private sector because of its risk aversion is not keen to invest without any guarantees. thus lack of investment has led to slackening of demand, and that can impact the gdp growth rate. now the other alternative on the horizon is foreign direct investment. it is thought that fdi would bring in substantial investment and in its wake create job opportunities and kick-start the economy for a sustained period with benefits accruing to all sectors of the economy. but that may have a longer gestation period. therefore, in that context again the chance of redemption is given to the middle class, this time in the shape of a pay hike again, with incentive to spend. this money will directly enter the market and speed up the economy. the government is banking on the forward and backward linkages that the circulation of this money would create and bring cheer to the economy. let us hope it does.",0.1059540891411753,middle class tool economics,"recent announcement

2016-10-06,‘india will need freer trade’,"new delhi, 05/10/2016: singapore prime minister lee hsien loong during an interview to the hindu in new delhi. photo: v. v. krishnan | photo credit: v_v_krishnan , currently in the country on a five-day trip, singapore prime minister lee hsien loong explains how india is invested in east and southeast asia. excerpts from an interview:, , you are one of the first dignitaries to visit india after the uri attack as well as india’s announcement that it had crossed the line of control to attack terror camps in pakistan-occupied kashmir. do you support india’s decision to do so?, , we stand stoutly against all forms of terrorism and cross-border terror is a particular problem that india has. singapore has a problem with cross-border terror too, because we are a very small country and it is quite possible for an attack to be mounted on singapore from beyond our shores. so we absolutely understand the seriousness with which india takes this problem. i think these are problems india has to manage over a long term and you need a tactical response, but at the same time you have to try and develop a relationship that is stable and constructive with your neighbours, particularly with pakistan. it is not something that is easy to do, but it is certainly something india has to work at and pakistan has to work at too., the un secretary general has said that he views rising tensions as a source of concern. do you see the impact of international concerns on investors at all, given singapore is the biggest source of fdi in india?, , any business that invests in india must understand the geopolitical environment that they exist in and things like this will happen every so often and they have to take a long perspective. if they get excited every time something happens, it will be very difficult to sustain your business., , where do you see the potential in india’s role at the asean, and could you throw some light on where the rcep (regional comprehensive economic partnership) negotiations are headed, as they seem to be delayed?, , india is not just an observer in the asean region. it is also your region, you have a lot of interests there, you are an asean dialogue partner, a participant at the east asia summit, ftas with the group. we hope that in rcep negotiations india will take a more liberal approach on freeing up trade and promoting regional integration. because as you need to promote “make in india” and exports to grow, you will need freer trade, not more protective trade., , the rcep grouping had said they hope to wrap up the negotiations by this year end. however, india’s commerce minister has said that worldwide there is a logjam, a traffic jam on all regional freed trade agreements. is rcep headed that way too?, , i don’t know if the worldwide traffic jam should affect the rcep project. the old model for india was to be self-sufficient. it was the ideal india became independent with, that you spin your own thread, make your own clothes. but today you don’t do that. you make clothes for the whole world, you buy things from all over the world. and therefore you need a different kind of approach to grow your economy and progressively deepen your engagement with rcep partners., , is india the sticking point in rcep negotiations?, , it is never helpful to point at sticking points, but it is always helpful to encourage one’s partners to take a more active and forward-looking approach., , despite the good optics, bilateral trade between india and singapore has actually decreased considerably in the past year…, , yes, trade is down year-on-year, but investments are up compared to 10 years ago. in the last two-three years with the new government you have set a new direction to the economic policy and as the new investments become realised i hope trade will improve. but for the trade to grow, india must make a strategic decision that you want to encourage interdependence and more openness and more trade-based economy. your trade is one-fifth that of chinese international trade even as your gdp is one-third china’s — so it isn’t in proportion with what it should be., , in what way can india be more open to trade?, , india’s approach has hitherto been one of self-sufficiency and trade was a very small proportion of gdp. india started to shift that with dr. manmohan singh through the 1990s and when he became prime minister. your growth rate increased because india was prepared to open up the economy, loosen government control, enable investments and free up the “animal spirits”. so tata, infosys, mahindra went all over the world. but you have to allow other countries to operate in india too. it cannot be a one-way exercise. the process of changing the environment and reimagining where india stands in the global environment still needs to be done., , where does singapore face the biggest bottlenecks in its economic relationship with india?, india’s rules are the consideration. you have multi-levels of government, you have a state government, a local government and many rules, and not all of them are consistent. land acquisition is another thing investors are concerned about. i think if you look at the singapore projects, we wanted to do industrial parks — they have taken very long to clear the issues of land and these become politicised and we can’t settle it, and eventually the project languishes and nothing happens.. yesterday i met the business delegation that came with me. they said the ministry here said there is nothing to stop them from setting up industry. so i said, really? and they said, yes, nothing to stop you but you have to go and buy the land yourself! (laughs) now, that may take a long time, and on an industrial scale it is impossible to do. so these are some of the issues, and if not overcome, they will be a problem., will the india-singapore tax treaty be revised, as is being speculated?, , that’s one of the issues for us. because india has revised the tax treaty with mauritius and you want to revise the tax treaty with us, which india is entitled to do. but you have to understand that singapore is different from mauritius. we know india is very focussed on black money, it is a very high-focus subject and we have been very careful to make sure the investments into india are legitimate. there is no ‘round-tripping’ or hot money or bad money being funnelled through singapore., , former prime minister lee kuan yew, your father, called india a nation of “unfulfilled greatness”. he felt that the indian bureaucrat viewed businessmen, especially if they were foreign, with suspicion. has that changed?, , i think mr. modi is trying very hard to change the ethos of the bureaucracy, and i wish him all success with that., , in terms of animal spirits, what is the animal that describes india right now?, i think indians consider themselves an elephant… doesn’t move the fastest, but does so inexorably., , in the meeting with prime minister modi there was a reference to keeping sea lanes open, in accordance with international law, a clear reference to south china sea (scs) and china’s actions there. how do you see india’s role on this issue?, , the scs dispute has many aspects to it. the specific maritime territorial disputes are at a bilateral level between china and four asean countries. but other countries in the region have an interest because of freedom of navigation and resolving disputes in accordance with international rule of law, that is unclos. india can contribute like other regional countries towards promoting a climate conducive to resolve disputes., , so is that a diplomatic role or a military role for india? the u.s. has spoken about joint patrols in the scs, which india hasn’t agreed to so far., , the u.s. has conducted freedom of navigation patrols, but each country has to decide for itself where its focus is. for india, you have an interest in the wider region, and historically india’s focus has been on the subcontinent, that has so many issues. but increasingly you have a wider interest in the region and that is why you are part of the asean forum which discusses security issues., ",0.0995451642865436,‘india need freer trade ’,"new delhi , 05/10/2016 : singapore prime minister lee hsien loong interview hindu new delhi. photo : v. v. krishnan &#124; photo credit : v_v_krishnan , currently country five-day trip , singapore prime minister lee hsien loong explains india invested east southeast asia. excerpts interview : , , one first dignitaries visit india uri attack well india ’ announcement crossed line control attack terror camps pakistan-occupied kashmir. support india ’ decision so?

2016-10-14,‘bangladesh is no longer an exporter of terrorism’,"in a rare interview, bangladesh’s prime minister sheikh hasina, who has been accused of wielding a heavy hand on her opposition, the media, and terror suspects, speaks for the first time about bangladesh’s troubled ties with pakistan, and pulling out from the saarc summit. ahead of her visit to india this weekend for the bimstec summit, ms. hasina counselled india and pakistan to maintain the sanctity of the line of control., excerpts:, bangladesh was a founder of saarc in the 1980s, but it has also been one of the first countries to pull out of the summit in pakistan this year. is this the end of saarc?, no, as we said in our official statement on pulling out, we consider that the environment prevailing in the saarc region at this particular time is not conducive to hold the saarc summit. bangladesh has certain sensitivities over the international crimes tribunal ict of bangladesh, where pakistan showed its dissatisfaction with our processes and even raised the issue in their parliament. they started interfering in our internal affairs by making unacceptable remarks. we felt hurt by this, as this is an internal matter for us, we are trying war criminals in our country, and it isn’t their concern. there is a lot of pressure on me to cut off all diplomatic ties with pakistan for their behaviour. but i have said the relations will remain, and we will have to resolve our problems. the fact is, we won our liberation war from pakistan, and they were a defeated force. we won the war and freed the country from them, and it is expected that they won’t take it so well., wasn’t terror emanating from pakistan the main issue for you? the fact that bangladesh, bhutan, afghanistan and india pulled out of saarc at the same time after the uri attack seemed coordinated, to isolate pakistan., it was over the situation in pakistan that we decided to pull out. the common people are the biggest sufferers of terrorism there. and that terror has gone everywhere, which is why many of us felt frustrated by pakistan. india and pakistan also have their bilateral problems, and i don’t want to comment about that. india pulled out because of the uri attack, but for bangladesh the reason is totally different., did you support india’s decision to launch a cross-loc strike into pakistan-occupied kashmir in order to kill terrorists on the other side?, well, i do feel that both the countries should maintain the sanctity of the loc and that can bring peace., but do you support the principle? last year the government had also announced that they had crossed over the border to myanmar in pursuit of terrorists. would you support a similar action with bangladesh?, i think you should ask these questions to your government and your prime minister. i do believe these boundaries, this loc must be maintained., i ask because since you took over as prime minister in 2009, the single most important driver in bangladesh-india ties has been your government’s crackdown on terrorism: shutting down terror camps, handing over more than 20 most wanted. what does that terror cooperation mean today?, look, i believe that terror should not be allowed to take root in bangladesh. whether it is with india, or myanmar, who we share a border with… since 2008, the steps we have taken, you can see the results. along our borders there used to be daily incidents of violence, bomb blasts, terror, and we have controlled that. we will not allow any group to use our soil to launch a terror attack against any other country. bangladesh is no longer an exporter of terrorism, nor is it a silk route for arms smuggling as it once was., how has the holey artisan bakery terror strike this year changed your war on terror?, terror is now a global problem, and i’m trying to take some different steps to fight it. i am reaching out to teachers in schools and colleges to spread awareness about it. next i’m telling parents to watch where their children go, whom they meet. we are asking clerics in mosques and madrassas to teach that islam is a religion of peace, and ensure that none speak of violence. with awareness and a social movement against extremism, we can prevent our children from becoming terrorists., you spoke to the hindu community here at the dhakeshwari temple a few days ago about zero tolerance. why did it take so long to act, given that many of the fundamentalist groups you are targeting now had earlier killed so many hindus and so many bloggers?, that’s not true. bangladesh has been the first mover against terror activities. investigations take time, not just here, but in all countries. but it is not fair to say we have been slow to react to these killings., human rights groups say law enforcement agencies are going overboard in this war on terror with custodial killings and disappearances, “kneecapping” terror suspects…, it is very unfortunate that human rights agencies are more vocal for the rights of the criminals than they are for the rights of the victims. what is happening in america? when they have an attack on their schools or anywhere, what do law enforcement agencies there do? don’t they kill the attackers and rescue people? should our law enforcement agencies not kill terrorists who attack them?, after the holey artisan attack, your government said the groups involved were local and not with the islamic state (is). but given that the is claimed it, the main suspect was trained by it, how do you respond to the charge that you are in denial?, maybe some of them are attracted to is, but is doesn’t have a base here as an organisation. if anyone has any evidence of is camps here, they should give us that evidence. we have identified the attackers, we know where they are from, and they are local., there have been calls from around the world to stop the hangings of people charged with collaboration during the war of liberation from pakistan at the ict. have these hangings 45 years later brought any sense of closure for bangladesh?, of course they have. after what happened in 1971 — they massacred civilians, raped more than 2,00,000 women, burnt village after village — it was a national demand from those who suffered at that time that these people must be tried., you’re saying this is the people’s demand. yet elected jamaat leaders have been hanged or are in jail, many opposition bangladesh nationalist party (bnp) office-bearers are under arrest or have gone abroad to escape prosecution. aren’t you confusing the war crimes trials with your own political rivalries?, no, it isn’t about my political rivalries. if you believe in freedom, in an independent country, how can you support these anti-liberation leaders? the bnp has patronised the war criminals. the cases against bnp leaders are different, and relate to corruption or crimes committed by them. so if these leaders are not guilty, they should face the trial and not try and flee the country. when i was in opposition, they filed a dozen false cases against me too., the bnp not only boycotted the 2014 elections, they tried to sabotage them. their workers torched schools that were polling booths, attacked electoral officers, destroyed buses and trains. in 2015, too they held the country to ransom for three months with their terror activities, killed more than 250 people. so they must face the law. these aren’t political cases, these are criminal cases. when i was in opposition they filed a dozen false cases against me too., you brought back democracy to bangladesh in 1996, yet today you preside over a parliament with no opposition in it. do you think in the next election, you will bring the bnp opposition back into the process?, as far as the bnp is concerned, they decided to boycott the elections. i telephoned bnp leader begum khaleda zia, but she didn’t take my calls. my father promoted her husband gen zia and we knew each other from those times. but she speaks in the worst possible way, and even refused my condolence visit for her son’s death by closing the door on me. she has ordered her party workers to protest, to carry out acts of violence. as a human being, what else can i do? it’s her fault, her decision to stay out of elections and i hope she doesn’t make the same mistake next time. but i won’t allow democracy to be jeopardised by her misdeeds., another part of democracy is freedom of the press. yet the recent arrest of a prominent editor, the new digital laws on defaming the liberation movement, with harsh punishments, send the signal that you are clamping down on the media…, when i came to power we had only one television channel, now we have 23. who did this? who allowed hundreds of newspapers to flourish here? and let me ask, if there is no freedom of the press, how come they have the freedom to write that there is no freedom? we arrested the editor (magazine editor shafik rahman, who was arrested for sedition) for other crimes. if he has acted against the country, he must face trial. otherwise bangladesh has so many editors, how many have been arrested?, chinese president xi jinping is in bangladesh ahead of his visit to india for the brics-bimstec summit which you will also attend, and your ties with china are being watched very closely in india. despite the opening of ties, why does trade with india lag so far behind trade with china?, actually our bilateral trade has improved a lot, especially after india gave us duty free quota free access (2007-08). in the past we bought our food grains from india, but now we are self-sufficient, so that is one reason perhaps for trade being lower. but we have a lot of capital goods, machinery, cotton now coming from india. our relationship is good and will continue to grow., but bilateral trade at 6-7 billion is behind trade with china.., it depends on the private sector, where they want to buy goods from. bangladesh has also been quite vocal about the huge trade imbalance between our two countries and removal of trade barriers, which is going on in phases. we also plan for the establishment of indian sezs at mongla and bheramara that would increase the fdi flow into bangladesh and narrow the trade gap., china is bangladesh’s biggest trading partner, it is its biggest defence partner, bangladesh plays a large role in china’s ‘one belt, one road’ initiative. isn’t it a valid concern for india that bangladesh could become what is known as china’s ‘string of pearls’ in the region?, you spoke of the good relationship between india and bangladesh. if that is the sentiment, then how can you make the allegation that bangladesh is inclining more towards china? no. our policy is very clear. we have good relations with everyone and we want to maintain that. and i believe connectivity is a very large part of good relations. we have established the bbin network, and good relations with bhutan, india and nepal as a result. we also have the bcim economic corridor with china, india and myanmar. so we can all join and improve our trade volumes and that means the economic condition of our people will improve. the purchasing power of our people will increase, and who will be the bigger beneficiary of that in our region? india. india is best poised to benefit from the bangladeshi market. you should realise that., you will visit india for the brics- bimstec summit this week, and then hopefully later this year for a bilateral visit. tell us what you hope to achieve., the problem in our region for all of us is almost the same: we have one common enemy and that is poverty, which we must fight to eradicate. with neighbouring countries we may have many problems, but i believe it can always be solved. india and bangladesh have done it, like we agreed to a ganges water treaty. as far as brics is concerned, we have expectations that brics leaders will extend a supporting hand to bimstec with its new development bank at affordable terms., will you discuss ways of better border management during your visit, since despite the implementation of the land boundary agreement (lba), while the enclaves have been settled, other issues remain, like illegal migration and border firing?, yes, the lba was a long-standing problem which we solved after 45 years. so if the big problem has been solved, we can resolve these smaller problems too. as far as border killings are concerned, our border forces on both sides, the bsf india’s border security force and the bgb border guard bangladesh have agreed to jointly investigate the incidents where bsf personnel have shot and killed innocent bangladeshi villagers, and the home ministers are discussing this. a few dots problems may remain, but see what a big, extraordinary example we have set for the world by exchanging our people and land so smoothly., the date for your bilateral visit hasn’t been confirmed yet... is that tied to solving the teesta water sharing agreement first then?",0.07170068390138815,‘bangladesh longer exporter terrorism ’,"rare interview , bangladesh ’ prime minister sheikh hasina , accused wielding heavy hand opposition , media , terror suspects , speaks first time bangladesh ’ troubled ties pakistan , pulling saarc summit. ahead visit india weekend bimstec summit , ms. hasina counselled india pakistan maintain sanctity line control. , excerpts : , bangladesh founder saarc 1980s , also one first countries pull summit pakistan year. end saarc?

2016-10-22,questions about narasimha rao,"on the occasion of the 25th anniversary of the economic liberalisation programme, many of the accounts looking back have tended to work at placing the prime minister at the time, p.v. narasimha rao, at the centre of the rewriting of economic policy. is this historically valid?, narasimha rao was a complex political personality whose career spanned half a century. any historical reckoning of his personality must first take cognisance of the fact that he was at the centre of two of the three most violent events of india after 1947: the anti-sikh violence of november 1984 and the destruction of the babri masjid in december 1992. vinay sitapati’s meticulously prepared biography of narasimha rao, half lion, is a sympathetic account (the second heading is “how p.v. narasimha rao transformed india”), which nevertheless recounts important events of 1984 and 1992., narasimha rao was home minister when indira gandhi was assassinated in new delhi on october 31, 1984. he was therefore in charge of the police in the capital and had the responsibility of maintaining the peace. sitapati reports senior lawyers ram jethmalani and shanti bhushan meeting narasimha rao after the widespread murders of sikhs began and pleading for his intervention. the home minister did nothing. the biographer also reports an interview with an unnamed bureaucrat who recalls a phone call the home minister received from an unnamed personality in the prime minister’s office. the instruction: the home minister should do nothing. the master survivor did just that as sikhs were being killed around him in the city: nothing. sitapati calls it narasimha rao’s “vilest hour”., there was another vile hour to strike in the years ahead., the role — or rather inaction again — of the prime minister, narasimha rao, in the events leading to the destruction of the babri masjid on december 6, 1992 remains a mystery. the prime minister was later accused of silently agreeing to the destruction of the mosque. there is no evidence of such diabolical inaction. but there is evidence, according to sitapati’s account, of narasimha rao asking, of all people, an assortment of babas, sants and gurus to persuade the bharatiya janata party (bjp) to rein in its storm troopers during the kar seva planned in ayodhya. the national leaders of the bjp also separately promised narasimha rao a peaceful assembly in ayodhya. so despite there being many signals of a likely catastrophe during the kar seva, narasimha rao chose to rely on babas, believe the bjp and did nothing. he had once again abdicated his responsibilities in a matter of critical national importance., if in 1984 the home minister deferred to his political bosses, in 1992 the prime minister of india, no less, who had immense powers in his hands, chose to do nothing. december 6, 1992, we now know, changed the face of india for the worse and the wound festers., the role/inaction of narasimha rao in these two events should be enough to damn him in history. yet we forget all that and now want to honour him as an architect of india’s economic liberalisation programme. but while narasimha rao as prime minister was the final decision-making authority, did he make an imprint on the liberalisation programme?, here is a conjecture and an alternative understanding. whichever the government and whoever was going to be the prime minister after the may-june 1991 elections, there was, given the existing framework of economic policy, only one package on the table awaiting implementation., everything points in that direction., in the second half of the 1980s, rajiv gandhi as prime minister had begun the slow and hesitant shift towards the market. in the background was the global shift towards the market, the gradual collapse of socialism in eastern europe and the changes in china’s economic policies. all this built up to a set of intellectual, political and economic arguments for india to change course., what was missing was a catalyst that would persuade the government to make the shift. this was provided in the early 1990s., in the closing years (1988 and 1989) of the rajiv gandhi government it was known that a balance of payments (bop) crisis was building up. this gained momentum through the v.p. singh government (december 1989-november 1990) and, after the iraqi invasion of kuwait in august 1990, developed into a full-fledged crisis during the apology of the chandra shekhar government (november 1990-june 1991). india had obtained loans from the international monetary fund (imf) in late 1990 and early 1991, and was possibly in negotiations for a larger structural adjustment loan which did not go far because of the collapse of the chandra shekhar government., even as fire-fighting by unstable governments was going on, plans for a larger restructuring were being prepared within the government. for instance, montek singh ahluwalia, special secretary, had, at v.p. singh’s behest, prepared a major set of proposals to completely overhaul the existing economic policy regime. this package was discussed internally and came to be reported in the press. later in april 1991, the future finance minister, manmohan singh, in a public speech laid out a framework of change which was remarkably similar to what was finally put in place. (this has also been recounted by mr. ahluwalia in economic and political weekly, july 16, 2016), so the broad features of the liberalisation programme had already been drawn up. all that was needed was a stable government to fill in the details and implement it. that was provided by the new government of narasimha rao. or to put it more strongly, unless the left had formed the government in 1991 (an impossible eventuality), whichever shape and colour of the new central government, it is more likely than not that the same set of measures would have been implemented. (we do not know and may never know if the package had also been formally or informally discussed with the imf and the world bank.), when a series of measures were finally announced — dismantling of industrial licensing, devaluation, relaxation of fdi norms, reduction of import tariffs, changes to the export-import policy, etc — they were all found to have closely followed the proposals that had earlier been discussed within the government., there was a “tina” mood in the government. the severe bop crisis that had engulfed india at the time was therefore used as an opportunity to introduce sweeping structural changes. as an accidental prime minister, narasimha rao had only endorsed a set of proposals that any other prime minister would have found placed before him at the time.",0.057473082473082485,questions narasimha rao,"occasion 25th anniversary economic liberalisation programme , many accounts looking back tended work placing prime minister time , p.v. narasimha rao , centre rewriting economic policy. historically valid? , narasimha rao complex political personality whose career spanned half century. historical reckoning personality must first take cognisance fact centre two three violent events india 1947 : anti-sikh violence november 1984 destruction babri masjid december 1992. vinay sitapati ’ meticulously prepared biography narasimha rao , half lion , sympathetic account ( second heading “how p.v. narasimha rao transformed india ” ) , nevertheless recounts important events 1984 1992. , narasimha rao home minister indira gandhi assassinated new delhi october 31 , 1984. therefore charge police capital responsibility maintaining peace. sitapati reports senior lawyers ram jethmalani shanti bhushan meeting narasimha rao widespread murders sikhs began pleading intervention. home minister nothing. biographer also reports interview unnamed bureaucrat recalls phone call home minister received unnamed personality prime minister ’ office. instruction : home minister nothing. master survivor sikhs killed around city : nothing. sitapati calls narasimha rao ’ “vilest hour ” . , another vile hour strike years ahead. , role — rather inaction — prime minister , narasimha rao , events leading destruction babri masjid december 6 , 1992 remains mystery. prime minister later accused silently agreeing destruction mosque. evidence diabolical inaction. evidence , according sitapati ’ account , narasimha rao asking , people , assortment babas , sants gurus persuade bharatiya janata party ( bjp ) rein storm troopers kar seva planned ayodhya. national leaders bjp also separately promised narasimha rao peaceful assembly ayodhya. despite many signals likely catastrophe kar seva , narasimha rao chose rely babas , believe bjp nothing. abdicated responsibilities matter critical national importance. , 1984 home minister deferred political bosses , 1992 prime minister india , less , immense powers hands , chose nothing. december 6 , 1992 , know , changed face india worse wound festers. , role/inaction narasimha rao two events enough damn history. yet forget want honour architect india ’ economic liberalisation programme. narasimha rao prime minister final decision-making authority , make imprint liberalisation programme? , conjecture alternative understanding. whichever government whoever going prime minister may-june 1991 elections , , given existing framework economic policy , one package table awaiting implementation. , everything points direction. , second half 1980s , rajiv gandhi prime minister begun slow hesitant shift towards market. background global shift towards market , gradual collapse socialism eastern europe changes china ’ economic policies. built set intellectual , political economic arguments india change course. , missing catalyst would persuade government make shift. provided early 1990s. , closing years ( 1988 1989 ) rajiv gandhi government known balance payments ( bop ) crisis building up. gained momentum v.p. singh government ( december 1989-november 1990 ) , iraqi invasion kuwait august 1990 , developed full-fledged crisis apology chandra shekhar government ( november 1990-june 1991 ) . india obtained loans international monetary fund ( imf ) late 1990 early 1991 , possibly negotiations larger structural adjustment loan go far collapse chandra shekhar government. , even fire-fighting unstable governments going , plans larger restructuring prepared within government. instance , montek singh ahluwalia , special secretary , , v.p. singh ’ behest , prepared major set proposals completely overhaul existing economic policy regime. package discussed internally came reported press. later april 1991 , future finance minister , manmohan singh , public speech laid framework change remarkably similar finally put place.

2017-02-03,reformist budget unveiled,"naushad forbes , budget 2017-18, coming at a time of global uncertainty, is a pragmatic, growth-oriented and smart policy statement, taking forward the reform agenda in a convincing and progressive manner. its stand-out features are many and innovative., adhering to the path of fiscal prudence is a key message reiterating the government’s commitment to sound macroeconomic management even when the situation calls for enhanced public spending. the high emphasis on infrastructure through big increase in government expenditure, particularly transport facilities and affordable housing, is very welcome as it would kick-start a new cycle of investment in downstream sectors., reduction of corporate tax for companies with less than ₹50 crore turnover is another pertinent measure that can greatly boost their competitiveness and encourage more job creation., consumer demand can be expected to receive a fillip with the higher allocation for rural and agricultural sectors, as also halving of tax rates at the lower end. the budget has taken a step towards public asset monetisation with airport land in tier 2 cities, where the proceeds can be used for upgradation of airports. this is an innovative move, and will hopefully gain pace in other sectors in time to come., institutional reform is evident in the abolition of fipb and listing of public sector enterprises. the fipb was rendered redundant after continued liberalisation of fdi regime, and the finance minister has promised further opening up to foreign investments. the listing of pses is evidence of government’s effort to add efficiency to their operations, besides promising to raise resources., demonetisation goes a step further with the stress on digitalisation and formalisation of the economy, which will have benefits for tax revenue and a better investment climate over the longer term. , the budget has also come out with an innovative electoral bond to clean up political funding, adding to the overall campaign against black money., going forward, a few areas require closer attention from the perspective of industry. while we greatly appreciated the relief in corporate tax rates for smaller companies, the larger ones too need remedies to become globally competitive. these companies generate significant employment and we look forward to lower tax rates as exemptions are phased out., further, the national innovation fund was announced earlier for boosting r&d. we would like to see a shift in r&d spending towards higher education institutes to bring it on par with the global average expenditure by universities, currently about 0.4% of gdp as compared to india’s average of 0.04%. this would also help to incentivise private sector outlay on r&d to make india a source of global innovation at a time when industry 4.0 is rapidly converging on us., there is one item in the budget of introduction of 10% surcharge on the incomes between ₹50 lakh and ₹1 crore which we feel is not in the spirit of rewarding the honest taxpayer. the data on taxpayers mentioned in the budget speech was eye-opening and it is important to expand the tax base., employment creation has been a central idea of the budget, and the inclusion of leather and footwear for promotional attention at par with the apparel sector is laudable. , cii would like to suggest that the provisions regarding fixed term and flexible employment and incentives for formal employment be replicated across other employment-elastic and employment-intensive sectors such as automotive, food processing, and so on.

2017-02-03,‘how many people withdraw rs.1 lakh a month from savings accounts?’,"economic affairs secretary shaktikanta das | photo credit: kamal narang , rising global uncertainty makes it difficult to predict when india's economy would return to the 8% growth mark, economic affairs secretary shaktikanta das said, although growth will be over 7% in 2017-18 and rise further in 2018-19. mr das also said that conservative revenue estimates for the coming year leave room for a positive surprise on the fiscal deficit front, which has been pegged at 3.2% of gdp in the budget. edited excerpts from an interview with tca sharad raghavan and vikas dhoot , , growth is expected to be in the range of 6.75% and 7.5% in 2017-18 as per chief economic advisor arvind subramanian. can we expect to return to 8% growth, perhaps, by 2018-19?, you see, i think this year, in 2017-18, i would expect the growth rate to be upwards of 7%. and going forward, in 2018-19 and 2019-20, i think there will be a northward movement of the growth curve. how much it will happen… i would have given a far more definitive answer if only the global situation had more certainty. the global situation has become even more volatile and uncertain than it was one year ago. so, unless there is some stability and certainty on that front, it would be very difficult., but as far as india is concerned, i would expect our growth to be upwards of 7% in 2017-18, and the growth curve would only move northwards., , niti aayog vice chairman arvind panagariya had said he expects the last quarter of 2018-19 to see 8% growth, but not the full year…, let us see. interest rates will move in the southern direction, growth will move in the northern direction., , last year, the government got windfall gains from low oil prices and telecom spectrum auctions. what about this year?, we have reduced telecom receipts in next year’s budget estimate to about rs 50,000 crore, although we got nearly rs 70,000-75,000 crore this year. on oil prices, we did benefit out of the cess which was levied, so therefore considering the already high base, we are only projecting a growth of 8.8% in indirect taxes., on the taxation side, i wouldn’t like to use the word windfall, but a lot of cash has come into the banking system and there are a lot of possibilities of getting some income tax out of that. either under the pradhan mantri garib kalyan yojana, should those people decide to declare it, or due to subsequent follow-up actions by the income tax department., , when would you consider the remonetisation process complete?, remonetisation is near complete. i am using the word ‘near’ because there is only one restriction which is there today: the withdrawal limit of rs 24,000 a week for savings bank accounts. but let us consider how many people withdraw rs 24,000 a week. multiplied by four, this works out to almost rs 1 lakh a month. how many people really withdraw rs 1 lakh from a savings bank account in cash - very few. therefore, practically, remonetisation is over. but because this restriction is there, i am saying it is near complete., rbi will decide the timeline for lifting the rs 24,000 a week restriction. the maximum cash is withdrawn from current accounts where the restrictions have been lifted. so (for) savings bank accounts, it is just a matter of time., , the ratan watal committee on digital payments recommended urgent amendments to the payments and settlements law of 2007 to protect consumers. can we expect that in this session of parliament?, that is why we have decided that we will comprehensively review it. now, the ministry will review the act, taking into consideration the recommendations of the committee. we will also have to consult other people associated with that act within the government. but we have made a beginning by introducing the payments and settlements board, announced in the budget., we are not planning to take up the overall law in this session of parliament. it requires a lot of consultation with other agencies, a lot of internal inter-ministerial deliberation. rbi will also be consulted, although its senior officials were a part of the committee., , on the less-cash push, the budget has announced a lot of things, including the cash transaction limit, and the limit on company cash expenditure, do you think more needs to be done?, the signs are clearly visible of a move towards digitisation. people are using more of cards, more of cheques… i think it is a very healthy trend. naturally, there will be more to be done. there are the interim recommendations of the committee of chief ministers and the ratan watal committee report, so we are studying all of that. it is a continuous process., , how would the confiscation of assets of absconding defaulters work?, we have two options. one is to amend some of the existing laws. the other is to come out with a new legislation to ensure that they appear before the concerned legal authorities or the relevant competent authorities. so we are examining both options., , is this linked to the finance bill proposal that airlines must share the list of all international passengers to and from india, three days before departure?, that is basically to get information on indians, who is travelling how many times. that the fm has himself mentioned in the budget speech. somebody shows a paltry income but travels abroad five-six times, either on business or on holiday, there is something missing… it is mainly for that. we had tried to get this information, if you recall, two years ago, from the income tax returns. then there were lots of objections that we are making it cumbersome. so now we are getting it through this…, , but it can be used to get information on the travel plans of somebody like a vijay mallya…, it is possible. but then nothing can prevent somebody from buying the ticket at the counter, last-minute. so therefore you need a legal mechanism which can deter people from just escaping the arm of the law. you confiscate the asset till they come and produce themselves before the authorities here., , the proposal to reduce the cash donation limit for political parties from rs 20,000 per person to rs 2,000 could be subverted by raising the number of donors.., in a democracy, how do you put a cap on the number of donors? everybody has a right to contribute to a political party. you cannot put a cap. it will not stand legal scrutiny. but they are required to file their tax returns in time within a specified time limit now. it is definitely a move towards cleansing the political system., the economic survey said that investment remains a challenge due to stressed bank and corporate balance sheets, but the larger part of the problem was the corporates. how does the budget look to prop up private investment?, the government has done everything possible to revive private sector investment. many big companies are saddled with their own npa problem. for banks, the government has been funding their recapitalisation needs as per the indradhanush plan. the government has amended the securitisation and reconstruction of financial assets and enforcement of security interest act of 2002 and the drt law (recovery of debts due to banks and financial institutions act). we have liberalised the fdi policy for asset reconstruction companies or arcs., the budget has said that the securitisation receipts of the arcs will be listed in the stock exchanges, so the arcs will be able to access more funds. they don’t have to lock-in their own resources. now i think the banks will have to fix the problem by using the arc or other routes available to them.",0.12173583121858984,‘how many people withdraw rs.1 lakh month savings accounts?

e-commerce, banks, insurance and other online-related services were major barriers for overseas investors, according to a report by the u.s. president donald trump’s administration., the findings were part of the report on foreign trade barriers from the office of the united states trade representative (ustr). the annual report points to a list of trade irritants in 63 nations., “india allows for 100% foreign direct investment in business-to-business (b2b) electronic commerce, but largely prohibits foreign investment in business-to-consumer (b2c) electronic commerce transactions,” according to the report., inventory-based model, foreign direct investment is allowed in a market-based electronic retailing model, but not in the inventory-based model, it added. , according to the report, the only exception that was granted was to single-brand retailers. single-brand retailers who meet certain conditions including the operation of physical stores in india may undertake to trade through electronic commerce. “this narrow exception limits the ability of the majority of potential b2c electronic commerce foreign investors to access the indian market.”, the trade barriers report also pointed out india’s tax (6% equalisation levy) on foreign online advertising platforms was not par with the international norms and warned the levy in its current form may impede foreign trade and increase the risk of retaliation from other countries where indian companies are doing business., “india recently began assessing an ‘equalisation levy’, which is an additional 6% withholding tax on foreign online advertising platforms, with the ostensible goal of “equalising the playing field” between resident service providers and non-resident service providers. however, its provisions do not provide credit for tax paid in other countries for the service provided in india,” according to the report., the report also pointed out that the levy would result in taxes on business income even when a foreign resident does not have a permanent establishment in india or when underlying activities are not carried out in india., “the current structure of the equalisation levy represents a shift from internationally accepted principles, which provide that digital taxation mechanisms should be developed on a multilateral basis in order to prevent double taxation.”, data storage, according to

service providers to store data within india to qualify for bidding for government procurements. the report stated that ownership restrictions in terms of insurance and banks, was a hurdle for foreign investors., even though the fdi limit in insurance has been increased to 49%, the regulatory requirement for the appointment of directors and other operational requirements are a concern, it said.,

2017-06-09,getting back on the growth track,"demonetised rs. 1000 and rs. 500 notes. file | photo credit: ap , the national income numbers for 2016-17 have been released. what do they convey? what do they hold for the immediate future? briefly, this is the picture. recent revisions in the index of industrial production and wholesale price index do not alter the annual growth rates for the recent years. , the differences are in one or two decimal points. the growth rate for 2015-16 is estimated at 8%. the growth rate for 2016-17 is 7.1%, which is the same as forecast a few months ago., it is the numbers for the fourth quarter of 2016-17, that is, for the quarter january-march 2017, which has attracted much attention. the numbers are being scanned with a critical eye to know what impact demonetisation had on the economy. the overall growth rate of gdp is 6.1%, which is nearly 1% below the growth rate for the previous quarter at 7%. the year-on-year decline is, however, steep., , in analysing the january-march quarter numbers, we need to keep in mind three factors. first, a decline in growth rate has been seen from the beginning of the year. the growth rate of every quarter has been sliding from the previous quarter. second, during quarter 4, the only two sectors which have shown strong growth are agriculture and public administration. public administration, defence and other services have shown a sharp increase of 17%. but for this, the overall growth rate would have declined steeply. third, the sectors that have shown a sharp decline are construction and trade, hotels, transport and communication. these are the sectors which use cash extensively. in the case of construction, output actually declined by 3.7% as compared to a rise of 3.4% in the previous quarter. however, the decline in construction should be interpreted carefully. , obviously the liquidity crunch brought about by inadequate availability of currency consequent upon demonetisation must have halted a lot of construction activity immediately. but the decline is also partly due to ‘shock effect’. after all, the construction and real estate sectors are notorious for their cash transactions and dealings which are not above board. there is a paramount need for the participants to adjust., it is naive to pretend that demonetisation would not have had a short-term disruptive effect which would adversely affect growth. the long-term benefits in terms of a change in mindset and behaviour of people and greater use of technology-driven payments system are in the future. they need further actions., fast remonetisation will help to eliminate the adverse effects caused by shortage of currency. the authorities also need to augment the supply of ₹500 notes in a big way. , , while decreased use of currency is a desirable goal, the authorities should not proceed on the assumption that it is actually happening and therefore the supply of currency can be reduced. while the adverse effects of demonetisation on gdp are clearly seen, it is difficult to decipher how much of the decline in growth rate in the january-march quarter is due to demonetisation and how much due to the underlying declining trend. now that the disruptive effects of demonetisation are behind us, we need to explore the other factors that may be holding growth back. the most disturbing aspect of the data just released is the continuing decline in the gross fixed capital formation (gfcf) rate, that is, gfcf as a proportion of gdp. it has been steadily declining and in 2016-17 it fell to 29.5% from 30.9% in 2015-16., in the days of high growth, it hovered around 33%. in recent years an attempt has been made to raise public investment. in fact, this effort, combined with some improvements in the efficiency in the use of capital, has led to significant improvements in the output of coal, power and roads. this is necessary and must be continued. but the ultimate answer lies in the pickup in private investment. , there is a general concern that despite reasonably high growth (the average growth of gdp for the three years beginning 2014-15 is 7.5%), job creation has been modest. growth can happen because of greater utilisation of existing capacity or new investment. job creation in the first case will only be modest as is happening currently in india. , it is only new investment that will push growth and that will generate greater employment. obviously, there are many other factors such as technology that play a key role in determining the level of employment. , for sustained high growth, we need new investment and policymakers must shift their focus towards this. in fact, foreign direct investment has been very high. despite this, the rate of growth of fixed capital formation has been weak. the sentiment, it is generally believed, has changed. the reform agenda has been pushed forward. the bankruptcy code has become operational. the goods and services tax will very soon come into force. the fdi rules have been considerably relaxed. all these are welcome steps. it will, however, take some time before the impact of the first two is felt on investment and

2017-09-13,time for course correction,"what do the latest numbers on national income indicate? what are the chances of the indian economy moving out of the current phase of relatively low growth? or are we stuck at a new ‘hindu’ rate of growth?, about a week ago, the central statistics office (cso) released the estimates of the gross domestic product (gdp) for the first quarter (april-june) of 2017-18. the numbers showed that in q1 of 2017-18, gdp grew by 5.7%. gross value added (gva) at basic prices grew by 5.6%. whichever measure you take, the growth rate has fallen below 6%. in the corresponding quarter of the previous year, gdp grew at 7.9% and gva at 7.6%. what accounts for the decline in growth rate by almost 2 percentage points? certainly, demonetisation must have had a negative impact. also, the destocking of goods which might have happened prior to the introduction of goods and services tax (gst) must have also had a negative impact., however, it might be inappropriate to attribute the entire decline of 2 percentage points to the two factors. what has been happening is a steady decline from the first quarter of 2016-17 when the growth rate of gva was 7.6%. by the third quarter of 2016-17, the growth rate had declined to 6.7%. since then it has fallen by another 0.9 percentage point. given the growth rate of 5.6% in q1, it is unlikely that the growth rate for the year as a whole will exceed 6.5%. for this to happen, the growth rate in the next three quarters will have to be 7%. the most disappointing aspect of the first quarter numbers is the steep fall in the growth rate of manufacturing to 1.2%. because of the good monsoon, agriculture will do better. since agricultural growth rate last year was also good, the increase may not be that much., if the economy has to get back to the high growth rate seen earlier, we need to understand the factors that might have been operating to bring down the growth rate., also readwhy india’s gdp growth is falling? , why india’s gdp growth is falling?, one of the arguments attributed to the low growth rate is the poor performance of the external sector. growth is fuelled broadly by two types of demand, domestic and external. high export growth has propelled the growth rate of many countries, including china’s. in india’s own experience, the high growth phase between 2005-06 and 2007-08 saw exports growing at an average annual rate exceeding 20%., india’s declining growth rate has also coincided with poor export performance. export demand has been weak because of the tepid growth rate of the advanced economies. both in 2014-15 and 2015-16, the export growth rate was negative. however, the export growth rate has become positive since the second half of 2016-17. while undoubtedly export demand is critically important to sustain high growth, the sharp decline in growth rate noted in the last few quarters cannot be attributed to poor export performance. in fact, as compared to the previous year, the export performance has improved., the fundamental problem has been the sharp fall in the investment rate. gross fixed capital formation rate stood at 34.3% in 2011-12. this started falling steadily and touched 29.3% in 2015-16. it fell further to 27.1% in 2016-17., according to the latest numbers, in the first quarter of 2017-18, it stood at 27.5%. since the public investment rate has not shown any decline (it stands at 7.5% of gdp), it is the decline in private investment, both corporate and households, that has been responsible for the steady fall. while the fall in corporate investment is steep compared to what was achieved in 2007-08, it has more or less stabilised at a lower level of around 13%. household investment, however, has continued to decline even in recent years. household here includes not only pure households but also unincorporated enterprises., also readwhere the jobs are: on the unemployment rate , where the jobs are: on the unemployment rate, deep concerns have been expressed about the fact that the growth that we have seen in recent years has not resulted in an increase in employment. the current period has therefore been described as one of ‘jobless growth’. it may be noted that data on employment are not very reliable. firm data are available only for the organised sector. the rest are estimated through surveys. in fact, in the case of unorganised sectors, very often the position is one of ‘underemployment’ rather than unemployment. growth can occur because of two reasons. one, it results from better utilisation of existing capacity. two, it can come out of new investment. whatever growth we have been seeing recently has come out of better utilisation of capacity rather than new investment. it is real growth spurred by new investment that generates more jobs., another intriguing factor about the falling investment rate is that the last few years have shown a steady and substantial increase in foreign direct investment (fdi). fdi inflows in 2016-17 were at an all-time peak of $60 billion. in the first quarter of 2017, the inflows were $10.9 billion. with this type of inflow and if the investment rate has not grown, the one surmise that one can make is that much of the fdi has gone into acquiring old assets rather than going to greenfield projects. all this implies is that domestic investors continue to remain shy., what can be done to stimulate private investment? first, in creating an appropriate investment climate, reforms play an important role. some of the noteworthy changes that have happened in the last few years are the passing of the bankruptcy code and gst legislation, and modifications in fdi rules.",0.07052002808699237,time course correction,"latest numbers national income indicate ?

2017-10-15, consultancy wisdom,"soon after coming to power in 2014, the government engaged a bahamas-based international consultancy firm, betaji, mamaji, kakaji & jijaji (bmkj), to prepare a report on what india must do to achieve 30% growth rate, 100% employment, and global superpower status by november 8, 2018. , bmkj submitted its report to the government in december 2015. but so far, its contents have remained secret. last month, an employee of bmkj who was fired for refusing to link his sperm count to aadhaar leaked the entire report to me. , all about ‘vikas’, going through the 560-page report, i was floored by its stupendous insight, which was this: india should not blindly ape the western model of ‘vikas’ (or development) by offering its citizens sops like free schooling, universal healthcare, affordable public transport, libraries, playgrounds, pension, etc. , instead, india should, the report said, pursue ‘vikas’ by focussing on what it does best: building statues. this is brilliant stuff, as you can see. and it offers two fantastic ideas for a mega statue, either of which could easily take india to the three goals stated above., bmkj’s first idea is to junk both the ‘statue of unity’ (a patel statue) in gujarat and the proposed statue of the great tamil actor sivaji in mumbai. it says that neither the patel statue (182 metres tall, costing ₹2,989 crore) nor the sivaji statue (190 metres tall, costing ₹4,000 crore) are ambitious enough, given indian’s true stature, and i totally agree. , instead of building such tiny, inexpensive monuments, bmkj proposes investing in a large ‘statue of vikas’. this would be a replica of a coconut shell, with a height of 560 metres and circumference of 16,000 metres. the giant coconut shell would be a grand tribute to the real engine of india’s ‘vikas’: shell companies. , despite thousands of shell companies in places like mauritius and singapore channelling billions of dollars of fdi into india, the average indian has little appreciation of their invaluable contribution to the economy. so the statue of vikas will not only be a symbol of the indian people’s gratitude to all shell company owners, it will also inspire every indian to stop looking for nonexistent jobs and blossom into entrepreneurs by starting their own shell companies. , while this is undoubtedly a superb idea, it is the bmkj’s second proposal that i find more exciting. it is inspired by fresh evidence unearthed by bmkj’s own team of forensic archaeologists, which revealed that, at the exact same spot where the indian parliament currently stands, there used to be grass. , the report presents ample documentation — by way of paintings, scriptural references, and shlokas — which proves conclusively that the land seized by the british in 1921 for the construction of the parliament building had plenty of grass. and eating that grass was a cow, which attained samadhi at this very spot 12,000 years ago after giving away all its milk to lord ram, who was passing by., naturally, the bmkj report calls for building a giant statue of this cow at the very spot where the aforementioned holy cow was standing and where the parliament currently stands. this cow statue, to be made of panchgavya specially reinforced with fibre glass, would be 4,000 metres tall. the horns alone, made of italian marble boiled in purified ganga water, would be 5,000 metres tall. , taller than everest, measuring 8,849 metres from hoof-bottom to horn-tip, it would be taller than mt everest. it would be visible not only from the moon but also from beijing and new york, sending a clear signal to the world that when it comes to standing monuments, india’s is bigger than anyone’s else’s.

2018-04-18,"we will stand by every community, we will safeguard their interests: ahmed patel ","when sonia gandhi was congress president, her political secretary, ahmed patel, was often referred to as the “second-most important person in the party”. a quintessential backroom politician, mr. patel rose through the ranks in the congress. he started with village- and taluka-level politics in gujarat, came to delhi for the first time in 1977, and was elected as a lok sabha mp in the first election post-emergency. thereafter, he worked with prime ministers indira gandhi and rajiv gandhi, and sonia gandhi, in different capacities in the congress. excerpts from the interview:, yes, it seems so. in 2014, the bjp came to power solely by making tall promises, which were unrealistic. the reality is that they have failed to fulfil their promises. if we look at the situation today, we can say that the country has regressed since former prime minister manmohan singh gave up office in 2014. be it economics or the social fabric or the agrarian issue, the situation has become much worse., look at the economic situation: the current deficit account is almost $75 billion, net fdi has reduced from $40 billion to $27 billion, the prices of petrol and diesel have skyrocketed, unemployment is at its peak. on the social side, there are atrocities against women where their own people are involved. crimes are rising against dalits, adivasis, the economically backward, and minorities. they had promised heaven on earth — “achhe din aayenge”. where are those achhe din? people are saying that the upa government days were better than this., indians are seeing the real ‘gujarat model’, as we saw during narendrabhai’s tenure as chief minister, when the assembly was routinely bypassed. now we see how parliament too is being rendered almost irrelevant by the ruling party. it is shocking that the house can’t debate a no-confidence motion, which has maximum priority in rules of business. those who fail to govern the country now want to win 2019 by dividing the country along caste and community., on ideology, the upa’s achievements, and the misdeeds and failures of the bjp-led nda government., ultimately, the question boils down to what will a poor man eat, can the youth find jobs, are farmers able to even recover the cost of farming. so, yes, it will be the common man’s economics., of course it will be. the ruling party will try its best to divert the election agenda from these key issues. their strategy is to divert and then divide through emotive issues., yes, the prime minister has done the right thing. but whether prior permission for the attempt was taken or not is still in the realm of speculation. only time will tell the truth. there are ways and means of controlling fake news but you cannot immediately suspend the accreditation of journalists. the emergency was eventually lifted and the defamation bill was withdrawn., of course. as you have mentioned, there is no doubt that public perception about this government is that corruption is rampant. look at how they have diluted the rti right to information act? there is a plan to reduce the salaries and rank of information commissioners. they have sat on the lokpal law and have shown no seriousness on the whistle blowers protection bill. they are doing this so that the people’s instrument to expose their corruption is blunted. let us not forget that defaulters and criminals fleeing the country on such a scale is unprecedented. they have no other work except to harass and defame the opposition., it’s too early to say anything. a decision will be taken at the highest level in due course in consultation with like-minded parties by the congress president., she is the chairperson of the congress parliamentary party. and rahulji being the party chief, naturally he will discuss such matters with soniaji, manmohan singhji and other senior leaders before taking a final decision., both. to win any election, the first condition is to have a strong organisation. the priority is to defeat the bjp in the national interest. i think he is concentrating on both., not only the rajya sabha election. even though we could not form the government in gujarat, the nature of the outcome has definitely boosted the morale of congress workers and other like-minded parties., yes. but at the same time, the results are not that bad. they have boosted the morale of the workers not only in gujarat but across the country. and credit should go to the hard work of the congress president and his team. in gujarat and other states, the agencies and government machinery were misused. at the same time, i must accept that their booth management is better than ours, maybe because of money and muscle power. and tripura is the best example of that., in tripura, we were always in the opposition., most of our strong leaders there defected to the bjp. we don’t know if it was an ideological defection or something else. those who have defected will soon realise the difference between the congress and the bjp., that’s a contradiction that has to be tackled, but it is not difficult. in a democracy, it is normal if we converge on national issues but diverge on local issues. we may be opponents in states and yet remain partners at the centre, because safeguarding the nation’s interest is supreme, and such situations have to be eventually accommodated. being a national party, such cases have to handled in a balanced manner., not just in the northeast, even in kerala our state unit is unhappy about our alliance in west bengal. but eventually it is only the congress that can give a platform for diverse parties to come together and unite opponents in a state for a larger national cause. we have done this in the past and can do this in the future., i think it is being worked out. you can’t have an action plan without hearing the suggestions of others. at the plenary, he gave young leaders and others a platform to voice their opinions and suggestions., what is the definition of secularism? the congress believes in standing alongside all communities and helping all of them fulfil their aspirations in india. we refuse to see communities as hierarchical. that is the creed on which independent india has been built, where every individual, every community has the space to achieve its highest potential. and when there is social harmony and cohesion, people are able to achieve their fullest potential. over the last four years, this simple fact — that all communities and citizens are seen as equal in front of the law and for the government — has been in jeopardy. but as the congress has done for the last 130 years, we will stand by every community. we shall celebrate their achievements and safeguard their interests., it is not true. we are weak in these states but we still have a substantial vote share. in fact, in west bengal and most of the northeast, we are a significant force. however, we will have to work very hard at the grass-roots level. and this is exactly what is being done by the congress president. the situation will definitely improve.",0.04889237746380603,"stand every community , safeguard interests : ahmed patel","sonia gandhi congress president , political secretary , ahmed patel , often referred “second-most important person party ” . quintessential backroom politician , mr. patel rose ranks congress. started village- taluka-level politics gujarat , came delhi first time 1977 , elected lok sabha mp first election post-emergency. thereafter , worked prime ministers indira gandhi rajiv gandhi , sonia gandhi , different capacities congress. excerpts interview : , yes , seems so. 2014 , bjp came power solely making tall promises , unrealistic. reality failed fulfil promises. look situation today , say country regressed since former prime minister manmohan singh gave office 2014. economics social fabric agrarian issue , situation become much worse. , look economic situation : current deficit account almost $ 75 billion , net fdi reduced $ 40 billion $ 27 billion , prices petrol diesel skyrocketed , unemployment peak. social side , atrocities women people involved. crimes rising dalits , adivasis , economically backward , minorities. promised heaven earth — “achhe din aayenge ” . achhe din ?

2018-05-06,rupee’s dancing to more tunes this year,"the rising trend of import of gold and white goods could very well be a manifestation of the rupee’s overvaluation. file , the indian currency has been facing some selling pressure for the last 4-5 weeks, chiefly on the back of rising crude price. the rupee fell against the u.s. dollar by a little over 2.5% in april, and 4.3% since the beginning of the year, making it the worst-performing asian currency., compared to the position as of end-march 2017, the rupee is now about 3% weaker vis-a-vis the u.s. dollar. rbi is reportedly intervening in the market to cushion the rupee’s fall., after nearly four years of subdued and benign oil prices and the consequent improvement in the country’s terms of trade, india once again faces its age-old vulnerability to high cost of oil import., u.s. dollar recovering, and this has come at a time when the u.s. dollar seems to be on a cyclical recovery path against other major currencies on the relative strength of the u.s. economy. on all such occasions in the past, the rupee as well as the capital account of the country’s balance of payments came under pressure., but this repeat of history now has other elements that compound the overall external sector vulnerability: overvalued rupee, rising current account deficit, sudden ebb in capital inflows and certain developments in the domestic political economy policy front., going by its 36-country trade-weighted real exchange rate index, the rupee is currently overvalued by more than 17% relative to 2005. the movement of this index over the last few years provides some interesting insights: the real effective exchange rate of the rupee has gone up by about 4.73% since 2015-16, but it remained flat in 2017-18, although the nominal effective exchange rate of the u.s. dollar fell by about 9% during that period., the table alongside illustrates this point. this highlights the structurally higher inflation in india not just in relation to the u.s., but vis-a-vis all its major trading partners and competitors as well., rbi expects cpi inflation to lie between 4.4%-5.1% during the current fiscal year, with higher inflation expected in the first half. for the purpose of this estimate, rbi has assumed an average oil price of $68 per barrel. if global prices turn out to be higher than this, then the inflation will be higher. with the benchmark brent having already touched a high of $75 per barrel, the possibility of inflation crossing 5% in the coming months is high., the moot point here is that the inflation differential between india and most of the major trading partner countries is close to 3%, which explains the sustained real appreciation of the rupee., in the past, real exchange rate appreciation would lead to abrupt and large changes in the nominal exchange rate of the rupee against the u.s. dollar, often triggered by domestic macro/political and global economic developments, the latest example being the burst of sharp depreciation of the rupee in august-september, 2013 caused by the so-called ‘taper tantrum’ announcement by the federal reserve to curtail its quantitative easing programme., , rising wages, the significant real appreciation of the rupee calls for a deeper probe as regards its causes and consequences for trade competitiveness. first, labour productivity has increased at an average rate of 6.3% annually since 2005, which is way higher than the annual average of 3.3% recorded in the previous 12 years., we need further research to determine if the consequent wage rise led to higher inflation, real appreciation and increase in current account deficit within the theoretical framework of balassa-samuelson effect., as regards the consequence of the real appreciation of the rupee, it needs to be ascertained if any increase in factor productivity in the tradeable sector has cushioned its adverse impact on the competitiveness of the country’s goods and services. this is crucial for the purpose of guiding exchange rate policies of rbi and the government. india’s current account deficit increased to 1.9% of gdp in april-december 2017 from 0.7% in the corresponding period of 2016-17 on the back of about 44% widening of the trade deficit during this period., while the country’s imports relative to its gdp is now much lower than the peak level reached in 2012-13, the performance of exports continues to be lacklustre. in the financial year 2013-14, exports were 17.2% of gdp and by the financial year 2016-17, the ratio fell to 12.4% of gdp., in the traditional areas of exports, such as garments and textiles, where india was second only to china, the country now occupies third position in textiles and fifth position in garments., the case of garments exports is interesting as in 2000 the share of clothing exports as a percentage of total global clothing exports of bangladesh, vietnam and india was 2.6%, 0.9% and 3% respectively. by 2016, while india’s share of global clothing exports has increased marginally to 4%, bangladesh has improved its share to 6.4% and vietnam’s share is a stellar 5.5%., this is a pointer to india’s inability to gain market share in a global business which is consolidating among the top ten countries. despite the claims of ‘make in india’, india does not yet figure among the top ten exporters of manufactured goods. china now exports manufactured goods worth $2 trillion (almost equal to india’s gdp) and its share of global exports of manufactured goods increased from 4.7% in 2000 to 17.9% in 2016., the silver lining in india’s current account in the past has been the export of services export. indian it services companies, which followed a low-cost global delivery model with success in the past, have not succeeded so far in graduating to the new world of artificial intelligence, machine learning and robotics., in the first half of the financial year 2017-18, growth in it services exports compared to the corresponding period in 2016-17, was a meagre 2.3%. growing trade protectionism in the west will certainly slow down the growth of exports of it and it-enabled services, unless indian companies move up the value chain. tourism and transfers from migrant workers in the gulf have remained robust., india’s gold import, which was $56 billion in 2011-12, declined 52% to $27 billion in 2016-17. however, a rising trend of gold import is now being seen, with the import in 2017 at 855 tonnes — a 67% rise over the previous year,, the other worrisome trend is the rapid growth in imports of electronic goods, which was $3.4 billion in 2011-12 and $42 billion in 2016-17 — a massive 12-fold increase in five years., there is a distinct possibility that imports of electronic imports, mostly from china, will surpass oil imports in the near future., the rising trend of import of gold and white goods could very well be a manifestation of the rupee’s overvaluation., the fdi and portfolio flows in the first nine months of 2017-18 remained robust. but, a decline in portfolios flows is taking place now, as evidenced by an outflow of $2 billion in april. foreign exchange reserves at $424 billion, with another $22 billion in forward purchase, look formidable to be able to quell any market volatility. but, as before, the leeway to spend the reserves is not unlimited and decline in foreign currency assets is already happening. further, applying imf’s metric of reserves adequacy, the safe level of foreign exchange reserves for india turns out to be $496 billion.,

2018-05-06,no sense in walmart-flipkart deal: fabmart founder,"u.s. retail giant walmart’s acquisition of flipkart will not only bring global expertise to the retail industry and grow the e-commerce market but also improve investor sentiment about exits from indian market, said satish meena, senior forecast analyst at research and advisory firm forrester research. but, in a separate interview, k. vaitheeswaran, who founded india’s first e-commerce firm — fabmart.com — said that the walmart-flipkart deal does not make any sense as retailer is doing the acquisition at $20 billion-valuation to fight for less than 1% of the retail market in india. edited excerpts: , if the walmart-flipkart deal goes through, what impact will it have?, meena: for the online retail market in india, it is good because it will bring in not only the money but a lot of expertise in the retail domain. and, ultimately, the customers are going to get the benefit. , the online retail market is small right now...around $20 billion and it is really important we have at least two or three big players amazon, walmart, alibaba... to grow this. for walmart, this deal is something that they have been looking at for 20 years to get access to the indian retail market, but our regulations didn’t allow them to enter and open stores. they did open the wholesale stores with bharti enterprises but that experiment was not very good and they skipped that venture. now, they walmart are facing the heat from amazon in the u.s market. they don’t want to repeat the mistake they did in the u.s where they gave amazon a lot of time to get access to the customer wallets. , they don’t want to give amazon more time here in india and then play catch up game four years later. they are paying the premium because flipkart is now the only player on which they can place the bet. it is really important for them to have this market. , vaitheeswaran: the deal is good for the ecosystem as it will open up the fact that yes, it is possible to get good decent exits out of india as well and hopefully encourage more investors to continue investing in the indian start-up ecosystem. but from the walmart point of view, i’m not sure the deal makes sense. , after 30 years the e-commerce market in america is less than 10% of the retail. in india, it’s less than 1%. walmart is investing $20 billion, whatever that crazy amount is, so that they can come and fight for that less than 1% of the retail market which does not make commercial sense, it is ridiculous! it is not that they would come and capture this 1% because amazon has already taken a large percentage. if they’re really good at what they do, they will get 25% of less than 1% of the indian online retail the market. flipkart has proved it over the last five years despite spending $3 billion-$5 billion in india... they have steadily seen their market share erode and they know the writing is on the wall that amazon, if not already ahead, would quickly get ahead. fdi is going to be a big issue for walmart. i think you would expect a lot of regulatory interest and attention on this. they can’t acquire flipkart and start opening the stores., will it make sense if amazon acquires flipkart?, meena: the logic is that they remove walmart out of the picture. if they acquire flipkart then there is no other entity left which walmart can bet on and which can be a competition to amazon. but the price is very big… the valuation is almost $19 billion- $20 billion, which is something amazon might not be ready to pay... but you never know. softbank flipkart investor is still not very clear, they might be still looking for a better price from walmart that is why they are still playing the amazon card. it may be a negotiation tool by the investors for a better exit., vaitheeswaran: they (walmart) already have great walmart.com technology which they run in the u.s. they move it here and hire people and in 24 months they have a great selection going and they put that $5 billion and compete with amazon and alibaba. they may never become number one in the indian e-commerce market but they could have become a very strong player at one-third of the investment. it is not as if time is running out and they have to do the deal otherwise they would lose. , amazon would have never bought flipkart because amazon knows that there are fdi issues that would happen. , why is flipkart being valued at $20 billion?, meena: amazon was very close to taking over flipkart but two things stand out which stopped the decline of the market share for flipkart. one is that they still own almost 40% of the smartphone category...second is that fashion category still remains almost 60% market share for flipkart and its units jabong and myntra. amazon is still not big in fashion. these are the two things which gave flipkart a kind of breathing space last year, though the gap between smartphone category is narrowing down, the fashion is still 55% versus 17%. it (valuation) is also a requirement for walmart to invest and get access to the indian market. , flipkart is the only player which can give them that kind of entry and scale at the same point in time. they are not investing in the current performance of the company (flipkart) but they are looking at the future addressable market which india provides in the next 15 years., vaitheeswaran: somebody must have gone and told walmart that if you don’t do the deal in india in e-commerce, the doors will be closed and no future player would be allowed. they must have panicked. i think somebody has done a clever valuation discussion with walmart. i don’t think that makes any sense, nothing has changed. , if you look at amazon versus flipkart, competitive performance over the last 12 months or any other metric, i would assume the flipkart valuation to go down, because amazon is not only closing the gap but is already ahead. i don’t think this (valuation is justified)., if this deal gets closed at $20 billion-valuation, would you consider flipkart as a success story?",0.10966707091707092,sense walmart-flipkart deal : fabmart founder,"u.s. retail giant walmart ’

2018-05-20,what’s roiling the rupee,"if you have dollar payments to make, you should beware of the ides of may. the behaviour of the exchange rate in may 2018 has been eerily similar to that in may 2013, the month that marked the onset of the ‘ taper tantrum’., sliding by more than 6% against the u.s. dollar since the beginning of 2018, the rupee now figures among the worst-performing asian currencies. the slide has been accompanied by the cocktail of factors that always roil the exchange rate. , in 2013, hints from the u.s. federal reserve that it was planning to taper its bond-buying programme saw the rupee slide by more than 20% against the dollar in a mere three months from may to august. this led india to the brink of a crisis and forced rbi to take drastic intervention measures such as raising interest rates and curbing gold imports. , should we now brace for a repeat of the episode? comparing key exchange rate drivers between then and now shows risks to the rupee are rising, but the situation is not as dire as in 2013. , cad under control, the main reason why the rupee is always on a sticky wicket is that india runs a persistent current account deficit (cad). that is, the country’s dollar outflows towards import of goods and services (and other short-term payments), usually exceed its dollar earnings from exports. , the wider this gap between the greenbacks flowing in and those flowing out, the more is the scramble for dollars in india, leading to a weaker rupee. this is why the absolute and relative levels of cad are critical to judge whether the rupee is in hot waters. on both counts, india is better off today than it was in may 2013., when taper fears hit global markets in 2013, india was in the midst of an unbridled import binge. in fy13, india splurged roughly $41 billion a month importing oil, gold, capital goods and miscellaneous items. it earned only $25 billion a month from goods exports. after adjusting for services trade, it ran up a cad of $87.8 billion for the full year. that translated into 4.8% of gdp, well above the comfort zone of 2.5%. , today, india’s imports are far lower, while its exports are much the same. in fy18, the import bill averaged $38 billion a month while exports brought in about $25 billion. at the end of the first nine months of fy18, therefore, india’s cad stood at $36 billion, which is estimated to go up to $48-49 billion for the full year. forecasters expect india to close fy18 with a cad just short of 2% of gdp, well below the alarming levels of fy13., given india’s perpetual dollar shortage, rbi stockpiles forex as a buffer against payment exigencies. it also draws from this war-chest to sell dollars, if the exchange rate turns unduly volatile., a rule of thumb measure used to gauge the adequacy of these forex reserves, is the number of months worth of imports they finance. rbi held foreign currency assets of $396 billion (excluding gold) last week, which covered india’s monthly import bill about 10 times. in may 2013, rbi’s foreign currency assets had covered its monthly import bill by a precarious 6.5 times. india’s record forex kitty also gives rbi enough ammunition to intervene if there is a speculative run on the rupee., simmering oil, oil imports, accounting for 25-30% of india’s import bill, is a key determinant of the size of the cad. in 2013, global oil prices (wti crude) were already on the boil ruling at $90-100 a barrel for two years before the taper tantrum hit. between may and august 2013, they further shot up to $110 a barrel, worsening the deficit. , in 2018, oil prices, after staying at $30-$60 a barrel from 2015 to 2017, have just begun to simmer. fired up by a host of factors — the opec’s production cutbacks, tensions in west asia, the crisis in venezuela and renewed u.s. sanctions on iran — crude prices have increased from $60 in january to over $71 in may. , various forecasters estimate that every $10 per barrel increase in crude oil prices can expand india’s cad by 0.5% of gdp. therefore, while soaring oil is bound to worsen the cad, the extent of that deterioration is hard to predict, given that oil price moves are seldom orderly. for now, india is expected to end fy19 with cad at about $70 billion or about 2.5% of gdp, a significant deterioration from 0.7% in fy17, but still only at half the levels seen in 2013. but oil prices will remain a to-watch factor to gauge the rupee’s direction. , iffy foreign flows, the above analysis shows that the fundamental factors driving the rupee aren’t flashing red yet. but foreign investment flows can turn out to be the make-or-break variable. , when a country regularly spends more dollars than it earns by way of trade, the gap has to be made up by foreign investors pumping in dollars, either by way of foreign direct investments (fdi) or foreign portfolio investments (fpi). , fdi has been flowing into india at a brisk pace in the last four years. data from the dipp tells us that india attracted about $36 billion in fdi flows in the first nine months of fy18. the year, therefore, will end with roughly twice the $22 billion fdi inflows seen in fy13. , but then, fdi flows can be quite lumpy and political uncertainties, such as looming elections can certainly act as a dampener. volatile fpi flows are even more of a wild card factor. fpis invested in india in fits and starts in 2017. nsdl data tells us that the country received $31 billion in net fpi investments, of which just $8 billion came into equities, while $23 billion flooded into bonds., the first five months of 2018 have seen these flows reverse completely, with fpis pulling out $3 billion. may alone has seen fpis withdraw $2.6 billion from india’s stock and bond markets. this was probably a key factor precipitating the rupee’s recent slide., looking ahead, only the most foolhardy soothsayers would try to predict whimsical fpi flows. but fpi equity investments are broadly influenced by the growth prospects of indian companies and their valuations relative to emerging market peers. here, the prognosis is not rosy as indian equities trade at a stiff premium to other ems after the four-year bull run.",0.017574786324786332,’ roiling rupee,"dollar payments make , beware ides may. behaviour exchange rate may 2018 eerily similar may 2013 , month marked onset ‘

2018-06-20, ‘we expect the economy to grow at 7.3% this year’,", to tackle the rise in non-performing assets (npas), india needs to take measures to address the root cause of the problem instead of finding short-term solutions, says rajiv kumar, the vice-chairman of niti aayog. with “inherited problems somewhat behind us”, the economy is set to grow above 8%, he says. excerpts from an interview:, there is a slowdown in economic growth. the growth in gdp is estimated at 6.7% for 2017-18. when can we realistically expect this to go above 8%?, the economy is now on track to go above 8%. all our inherited problems are somewhat behind us. this government came to office with a huge mountain of npas, an inherited policy paralysis, the economy was going down and inflation was very high. so, it has taken a while to get it the economy back on track. private investments had simply stopped at that point due to issues such as the twin balance sheet problem. all that is behind us. if you even see successive quarters, the economy is on the path of growth. we expect the economy to grow at 7.3% this year. my own expectation is that we will cross 7.5% this year. we should be able to cross 8% next year and reach 9% by 2022-23. the reason for my bullishness is that a huge amount of work has been done. difficult structural reforms have changed the game, and the game going forward will be more robust and sustainable., but now do you see private investment coming in?, if you see some of the details, you will find that the growth of commercial bank credit to non-agricultural businesses has increased. it is now about 12%. while it is not yet as high as 21-22%, as it was in 2011-12, it had become negative in 2016. so far, commercial banking credit has largely been for retail loans that include housing and automobiles, and actual commercial credit growth to industry — manufacturing and services — is not that high. that is a cause of concern. but commercial bank credit is one of the engines on which private investment fires. the second is ipos initial public offerings and the third is corporate bonds. luckily for us, the other two engines have started firing., the short point being that private investment has finally picked up. though not financed by commercial banks, it has picked up with the necessary finance coming from the capital markets and fdi., an issue that india seems unable to get a handle on is npas., it is a systemic problem. we have had this issue in the past as well. this time, the magnitude is much bigger. in my mind this is related directly to corporate governance within commercial banks. if you look across commercial banks, some banks, largely in the private sector, have done very well in the same atmosphere., for me, the npa issue is what former reserve bank of india deputy governor rakesh mohan called the result of ‘lazy banking’. by lazy banking, i mean the lack of capacity within commercial banks to properly and diligently assess credit risk and manage credit risk. unless we address that issue, any other measure that we take will only be a short-term palliative. i don’t see much point in that because it is just pushing the problem down the road. , the issue needs an in-depth diagnosis and a careful and sustained handling. this is something i hope that the department of financial services will put its mind to rather than finding short-term solutions. we need to address this issue in a manner that we put the problem behind us, once and for all., what measures would you suggest?, if i suggest anything i would be doing it without the required diagnosis. however, in my perception, the p.j. nayak committee had done a careful diagnosis of all this. therefore, that should be looked at more carefully. but maybe we need to go beyond that and look at things from another dimension. all the measures in the past such as indradhanush and recapitalisation have not done the trick. therefore, it is time to go to the drawing board for a careful diagnosis and then a sustained handling rather than rushing to some other measure in the hope that that will address the issue., is there a need to rethink the privatisation strategy?, it is a process and we can’t rush through it. the fact is that the government’s commitment to it is very clear. niti aayog has been given a clear mandate to push for it. we have put out five lists for disinvestment, including a list for closures. of the dozen units we recommended to be closed, i believe two have been done. people don’t focus on this but it is also part of rationalising the public sector enterprise structure., disinvestment has to be done in consonance with existing market conditions. we don’t want to do a fire sale. all these are government assets, and we want to get maximum value out of these assets. i think, therefore, that the pressure to keep counting how many have been done in a week or month is not fair. last year, we had exceeded the disinvestment target. i am sure we’ll do that again this year., you have spoken in favour of a cut in duties on petrol. do you think that is feasible, given that the government is also talking about rationalising gst rates?, the prime minister has made it clear that he is committed to the fiscal targets. so, whatever is done must be done in that context. you need to find additional fiscal space if you are going to rationalise gst rates or cut excise duty on fuels. i’m not saying there is a trade-off here. if you can, do both. but if you can’t find the necessary fiscal space and may have a fiscal slippage, the prime minister is clear he doesn’t want that to happen., i have always said that excise on petrol should be cut as, in my view, there is additional fiscal space available. but i don’t think there is additional fiscal space available at this time to do both., do you think petroleum should be brought under the gst?, it is a very attractive proposition but you should look at the current incidence of tax on petroleum. it is about 85% to 90%, so at what band will you bring them into gst? i think it should be brought under gst but it will have to be fairly sequenced. in that sense, maybe over a medium-term period. with that you will have to grow additional sources of revenue to achieve that. and we are on the right track. the direct tax net has increased from ₹3.7 crore to ₹6.4 crore. there is scope perhaps to grow more. similarly, with indirect tax, gst collections are at a lakh crore rupees/month level. this is despite the fact that only about 90 lakh businesses have registered, of which 67 lakh now pay or file a return under gst. but if you compare that with the total number of business units in the country with a turnover of ₹20 lakh, we are still at a fairly small percentage of the potential indirect taxpayers., all of this is to say that there is potential revenue space going forward. as we grow, we can start reducing dependence on oil taxes. but at the same time, i am very careful to point out that expansion of the tax base is not in any sense dependent on, or related to, any form of high-handedness of the tax administration. it is just the opposite. if the tax administration becomes more friendly, tax compliance improves. but we have not let that happen in our country., the government has said that one of the reasons for lower growth is that the global economy is still performing below par and that countries are increasingly looking inward., i don’t think the government has done that this year. the government is acutely aware that you have had synchronised recovery of the global economy after a very long time. the growth of global trade is higher than that of the world economy in many years. despite all the talk of protectionism, all this noise that you hear coming out of washington dc particularly, the multilateral trading order has held and global trade is growing., an important issue is to take the entire exports sector and efforts well and truly into our hands to make sure that our share of exports, especially manufactured exports, in world trade improves and is not stuck at 1.6% as it has been for a while. even our services exports, which i think have a share of 3.2%. they have been facing some headwinds because of issues relating to h1b, automation, internet of things and ai. these are big-time structural issues and it’s time now to look again at this whole external sector, especially exports of manufactured good and services. the department of commerce is seized of the problem and is devoting time and effort. i am hopeful that we will come out with a set of measures to improve this.",0.04373034048224888,‘we expect economy grow 7.3 % year ’,", tackle rise

2018-08-13, making data speak ,"sridhar venkatraman, a subscriber of the e-paper from milton keynes in the u.k., wrote to us with a few interesting questions about data visualisation in news stories and on the oped page. he said: “first, hats off to the graphics team for making interesting charts and maps and introducing variety to the readers. the charts and maps help in understanding numbers better than tables do. however, the circle-style graph is becoming repetitive. and in some cases, the circles are too small and the text on them is so tiny that i have to zoom in to read. if i zoom in, the context of the entire graphic is lost and i can see only one or two points in close up. as a reader, i am not interested in zooming in and seeing every single state in the country.” mr. venkatraman then listed seven data stories to substantiate his argument., the reader makes an important point about the inherent problems with data visualisation. the charts which he refers to are called scatter plots. the data team uses scatter plots specifically for those stories that require multiple variables to explain the complex nature of interplay., the data team explained the rationale for relying on scatter plots rather than the usual pie charts for the stories cited by mr. venkatraman. for instance, in the story “karnataka sees 300% jump in fdi inflows” (july 24), the data team used a scatter plot to show changes in fdi equity inflows between 2016-17 and 2017-18, respectively, for major states (represented by their reserve bank of india circle offices). the scatter plot sought to answer some questions: which were the states with the highest and lowest fdi inflows? and among states within the high and low fdi inflow categories, which were the ones that registered an increase or decrease and what was the magnitude of those changes?, “by plotting the variables on a scatter plot and setting the graph with a trend line, we were able to isolate states above the trend line (increase in fdi) and below (decrease in fdi). with varying circle sizes in the plot (called bubbles), we indicated the percentage increase in fdi inflow. and by plotting the states on an x-y axis, we managed to show which states had the highest and lowest fdi inflows. all these were conveyed in a 2.5 column and 5 cm space. with the text, we managed to restrict the graphic to a rectangle of 3 column and 10 cm space,” said a data team member., the data team also explained a data story, “mutually dependent”, that appeared on the oped page in the ‘data point’ section on july 24. “we used a scatter plot to show that a higher number of patents are granted in states that have a flourishing start-up environment and vice versa. data points have a fixed space of about 2 column x 9 cm. if we had not used scatter plots, we would not have conveyed the entire picture. the data point would have only managed to show either the number of patents granted per state or the number of start-ups there. it would have been a simple visualisation — a map of states or a bar chart that showed the states with the highest and lowest number. but it would have missed the bigger picture. the scatter plot, therefore, was again chosen specifically to enhance the information,” he said.",0.07180875576036867,making data speak,"sridhar venkatraman , subscriber e-paper milton keynes u.k. , wrote us interesting questions data visualisation news stories oped page. said : “first , hats graphics team making interesting charts maps introducing variety readers. charts maps help understanding numbers better tables do. however , circle-style graph becoming repetitive. cases , circles small text tiny zoom read. zoom , context entire graphic lost see one two points close up. reader , interested zooming seeing every single state country. ” mr. venkatraman listed seven data stories substantiate argument. , reader makes important point inherent problems data visualisation. charts refers called scatter plots. data team uses scatter plots specifically stories require multiple variables explain complex nature interplay. , data team explained rationale relying scatter plots rather usual pie charts stories cited mr. venkatraman. instance , story “karnataka sees 300 % jump fdi inflows ” ( july 24 ) , data team used scatter plot show changes fdi equity inflows 2016-17 2017-18 , respectively , major states ( represented reserve bank india circle offices ) . scatter plot sought answer questions : states highest lowest fdi inflows ?

2018-10-16,decoding the rafale controversy ,"the controversy over prime minister narendra modi’s decision to go in for an outright purchase of 36 rafale fighter jet aircraft, after scrapping the old negotiations, is unlikely to die down. the congress party has yet to find a smoking gun and hopes that a joint parliamentary committee probe might reveal it. the government has meanwhile tied itself up in knots by making opaque, and often, contradictory statements, in turn raising more doubts and questions., there are three questions that the government needs to address to neutralise the snowballing controversy. the first is the rationale for the announcement made by mr. modi, during his official visit to france, in april 2015, that india would buy 36 rafale aircraft in a government-to-government deal, thereby scrapping ongoing negotiations with dassault aviation for 126 aircraft., the process for acquisition of 126 aircraft to replace a part of the aging fleet in the indian air force (iaf) had begun in 2000. after prolonged deliberations, a request for information was issued and based on the responses, technical specifications drawn up and a global tender issued in 2007 for 126 aircraft, with 18 to be delivered in flyaway condition and 108 to be assembled by hindustan aeronautics limited (hal) with gradually increasing domestic content. six bids were received and technical evaluations over four years led to the short-listing of two — the eurofighter typhoon and the rafale. evaluation of financial bids in 2011 led to the rafale’s selection and negotiations commenced with dassault in 2012., the indian air force strength had reduced to around 32 squadrons against its authorised level of 42. instead of fast tracking the negotiations, former union defence minister a.k. antony was indecisive, thereby prolonging the process. negotiations were carried forward by the modi government and in the run-up to mr. modi’s visit, official statements indicated that negotiations were in final stages. inexplicably, these were jettisoned. then defence minister manohar parrikar acknowledged that he was unaware of the decision. the decision for 36 aircraft was only formalised by the defence acquisition council and the cabinet committee on security after the visit and the formal cancellation of the negotiations for 126 aircraft announced in the middle of 2015, generating speculation about the paris announcement. last week, a bench of the supreme court, headed by the chief justice of india, ranjan gogoi, sought details of the ‘decision making process’ before the next hearing on october 31., , the aircraft are to be delivered between 2019 and 2022. meanwhile, the government invited expressions of interest in april 2018 for 110 fighter aircraft, 17 in flyaway condition and the balance to be assembled in india, but assembly was not restricted to hal. it has since received responses from the same six manufacturers. this makes it clear that the shortfall will not be made up by the indigenous tejas aircraft which is suffering from delays and cost over-runs (hal has raised the cost of tejas mark i from ₹135 crore in 2006 to ₹268 crore and tejas mark ia, in design stage, is quoted at ₹463 crore)., the second question relates to pricing. since the earlier negotiations for 126 aircraft were never concluded, a straightforward comparison is not feasible. earlier negotiations did not cover weapon systems or the performance guarantees and spares. however, since the modi government boasted that it had negotiated a better deal and promised to provide details, it has now been hoisted with its own petard. it proudly announced that it had obtained a 50% offset undertaking which would give a boost (nearly ₹30,000 crore) to the ‘make in india’ programme in the defence sector. perhaps, it failed to realise that the higher offset would be factored into the aircraft price, driving it higher., from the sketchy details provided, it would appear that the total outlay is €7.87 billion (₹59,000 crore at 1 euro to ₹73.88). this includes cost of weaponry (€710 million) and a performance guarantee of 75% (current performance level of the sukhoi-30 fighter assembled by hal is 50%) with spares (€2.16 billion). this brings the cost of the 36 aircraft, with the india-specific enhancements to €5 billion (₹36,900 crore or ₹1,025 crore per aircraft). however, union minister of state for defence, subhash bhamre has put the cost at ₹670 crore per aircraft. of course, the congress claims that it was negotiating on the basis of a price per aircraft of ₹526 crore but omits to mention what this related to or the exchange rate., the government has taken refuge behind the 2008 agreement with france regarding exchange and reciprocal protection of classified or protected information, which it renewed in march 2018. this is unconvincing as the french president emmanuel macron has publicly declared that the french government has no objection to the indian government sharing pricing details with parliament. therefore, the government’s obfuscation regarding pricing only generates doubts., the third question relates to the offset share given to dassault reliance aerospace ltd, or dral (a 51:49 joint venture between reliance aerostructure ltd and the dassault group). the congress has cited ₹30,000 crore while the dassault chairman, eric trappier, has stated that the figure is 10% of it as it has signed offset partnerships with more than 30 other indian partners and the choice of indian partners was its independent decision. this is inconsistent with former french president françois hollande’s statement to a french news website, mediapart, in september that reliance was proposed by the indian government and that the french did not have a choice in the matter., adding to this is a set of timing coincidences. reliance defence ltd was registered in march 2015, weeks before mr. modi’s visit to france. reliance aerostructure was registered on april 24. the offset guidelines were amended in august 2015, weeks after scrapping the negotiations for 126 aircraft, relaxing the obligation on the foreign vendor to provide technical details about the indian offset partner at the time of winning the contract by postponing it to when the offset credits are claimed or a year before it is due. this has permitted the government to feign ignorance about dral’s offset share., the agreement for 36 aircraft was signed by the two defence ministers on september 23, 2016. dral was registered on october 3 while fdi in defence had been liberalised to permit 49% through the automatic route in june of the same year. in october 2017, the foundation stone of the dral facility was laid in nagpur in the presence of maharashtra chief minister devendra fadnavis and union minister nitin gadkari. conflicting statements have been made about whether dral would produce components for the rafale or for dassault’s business jets.",0.04487066431510876,decoding rafale controversy,"controversy prime minister narendra modi ’ decision go outright purchase 36 rafale fighter jet aircraft , scrapping old negotiations ,
