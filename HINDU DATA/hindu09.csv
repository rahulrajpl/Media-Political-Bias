2011-09-28,youtube lessons,"choose the subject know all that you want to about it through youtube , a techie group told me about the khan academy. “check out the salman khan youtube lessons,” they said. “this salman engages students across time-zones without ever appearing on the screen.” i logged on., khanacademy.org has impressive stats. some 77,331,379 lessons delivered, a library of over 2,400 videos covering everything from arithmetic and physics to finance, and history, with 180 practice exercises. there are brain teasers, tips on the credit crisis. gmat problems? check. iit jee? check. plate tectonics? check. it's a growing collection of very popular free lessons., with an impeccable harvard and mit educational background, khan developed his tutoring hobby when a younger cousin was having trouble with sixth-grade math. it was a hit, requests grew, and tired of repeating the explanations for family and friends, he created videos and posted them on youtube. these morphed into khan academy, a one-man show of videos posted from his bedroom., each clip lasts a digestible 10+ minutes. his disembodied voice (he never appears on camera) thinks aloud and writes the equations and arguments in differently-coloured script. “it feels like someone's over your shoulder talking in your ear, as opposed to someone at the blackboard who is distant from you,” said khan, once a “california hedge-fund manager by day and math geek by night,” but a full-time youtube lesson-developer now., khan's “voice-in-the-head” style of teaching may be a big draw, but the medium itself has many built-in pluses. it's an attractive concept: short lessons that can be played over and over with p-in-p. a clever teacher can use youtube lessons to advantage, starting from getting the students to listen. she can put together a playlist of youtube videos on a single subject for continuous viewing, create quiz videos for instant feedback, make a “test review” video that students can study the night before the big test, and embed quizzes on a class blog or site so students can watch a video and complete the quiz at the same time. she can assign watching/creating videos as homework, giving herself the much-needed time to spark discussions in class. completed assignments/discussions can be uploaded on the class youtube channel, for future reference. youtubers can implement something teachers have long recognised — there are many ways to explain a topic and there is more than one way to test student understanding. imagine logging on to four different videos, all explaining the concept of number patterns in different ways. it is 1:1 tutoring., unlimited content, all free (youtube.com/edu). some of the lessons are downright substandard, but you wouldn't want to miss lectures from mit, uc berkeley and, of course, khan academy on differential calculus, quantum physics and introduction to computer science. lectures from world-known teachers are accessible anywhere, anytime. for english usage, expressions and grammar, you'd certainly want to listen to jennifer at jenniferesl. she gets my vote., with more internet users and broadband, youtube and other video-clip (google video, vimeo) lessons will become popular. but don't discount the downside. sound quality is sometimes poor, pronunciation and slang could put you off. choose your videos well, and encourage teachers to create content that is tailored to your particular student community. there'll be a big “thank you” from rural students when they discover the english learning possibilities on youtube., but the very reach of these free youtube lessons should get us thinking. “any video clip that shows “how” stuff works is usually better than just plain text,” said datla v reddy, gm @ ku education digital india, a u.s.-based company focussed on k-12 curriculum development, learning management systems and teaching services. “it ensures that students get to see it visually, allows for better understanding and recall.” some of them, like those from khan academy have achieved cult status, but should they be the sole way of learning? “they might blunt holistic learning as videos are usually one-dimensional and not interactive. also in an uncontrolled environment like youtube, there is no control on the educational accuracy of the video uploaded and hence may lead to occasional wrong learning,” he warned., for a video lesson:, * decide on a particular topic that your class would enjoy., * find youtube urls for videos on the topic., * if you do not have an internet connection in class, go to keepvid, download the video to your computer for use in the class., * introduce the video in class. distribute a vocabulary hand-out. make sure to include the url of the youtube video.",0.1504351395730706,youtube lessons,"choose subject know want youtube , techie group told khan academy. “check salman khan youtube lessons , ” said. “this salman engages students across time-zones without ever appearing screen. ” logged on. , khanacademy.org impressive stats. 77,331,379 lessons delivered , library 2,400 videos covering everything arithmetic physics finance , history , 180 practice exercises. brain teasers , tips credit crisis. gmat problems ?

affairs minister venkiah naidu on thier way to address the joint session of parliament house in new delhi on monday. photo: r.v.moorthy , central hall of parliament, new delhi: 09-06-2014, honourable members, i am delighted to address this >first session of both houses of parliament after the elections to the 16th lok sabha. let me begin by extending warm greetings to my fellow citizens, who participated in large numbers in the recently concluded lok sabha elections. we should never forget that we are here because of them. serving them should be our first priority. i also felicitate the members of the new lok sabha. you have successfully obtained the mandate from the electorate and now you represent their hopes, aspirations and dreams. i extend a warm welcome to all of you and hope that the sessions ahead with heavy legislative agenda will be productive and useful., 2.it is a matter of great satisfaction that the recent general elections were smooth and largely peaceful. i would like to congratulate the election commission of india and the official machinery for conducting these elections successfully. the unprecedented interest shown by the people of india in the elections is a sign of progressive deepening of our vibrant democracy. before i dwell upon the tasks ahead of us, i would like to express my solidarity with the families of all those who lost their lives during the election process., 3.i congratulate the new speaker of the lok sabha on her unanimous election to this august office. by successively electing women speakers, the lok sabha has re-affirmed our age-old belief in the importance of women in our society., honourable members, 4.this has been an election of hope. it marks a turning point in the evolution of our democratic polity. the surge in aspirations and the belief that these could be realized through democratic processes, has been amply reflected in the record 66.4% participation by voters, and a clear verdict in favour of a single political party after a gap of nearly 30 years. the electorate transcended the boundaries of caste, creed, region and religion to come together and vote decisively in favour of development through good governance., 5.the country needed a strong and stable government that could provide effective leadership. in my republic day speech earlier this year, i had hoped for 2014 to be a year of healing after the fractured and contentious politics of the previous years. standing here today, i applaud the wisdom of my fellow citizens for having voted for stability, honesty and development in a resurgent india in which corruption will have no place. they have voted for a united, strong, and modern india - “ek bharat - shreshtha bharat”. my government will work to fulfill these aspirations; with the involvement of all the 125 crore people of this great country., 6.my government is committed to nurturing the right environment for actualizing this mandate of the people. for this, it pledges itself to the principle of ‘sabka saath, sabka vikas’; which can be fulfilled only through your active participation. we will work together to re-establish the credibility of the institutions of democracy. my government will function on the mantra of ‘minimum government, maximum governance’. in all our actions, we will be guided by the core values of our great civilization., honourable members, 7.my government is dedicated to the poor. poverty has no religion, hunger has no creed, and despair has no geography. the greatest challenge before us is to end the curse of poverty in india. my government will not be satisfied with mere “poverty alleviation”; and commits itself to the goal of “poverty elimination”. with a firm belief that the first claim on development belongs to the poor; the government will focus its attention on those who need the basic necessities of life most urgently. it will take necessary steps to provide security in its entirety to all citizens; through empathy, support and empowerment., 8.containing food inflation will be the topmost priority for my government. there would be an emphasis on improving the supply side of various agro and agro-based products. my government will take effective steps to prevent hoarding and black marketing. it will reform the public distribution system, incorporating best practices from the states. my government is alert about the possibility of a subnormal monsoon this year and contingency plans are being prepared., 9.despite more than two-thirds of our people living in rural areas; we have not been able to provide adequate public amenities and livelihood opportunities to them. my government is committed to improving the quality of life in our villages, through empowered panchayati raj institutions. a substantial part of investment will focus on creating community assets and improving basic infrastructure such as roads, shelter, power and drinking water. my government will strive to end the rural-urban divide guided by the idea of rurban; providing urban amenities to rural areas while preserving the ethos of the villages., 10.agriculture is the source of livelihood for majority of our people. in the recent past, our farmers have been under severe stress with hopelessness driving some of them to suicides. my government is committed to reversing this unfortunate trend. it will increase investment in agriculture, both public and private, especially in agri-infrastructure. steps will be taken to convert farming into a profitable venture through scientific practices and agro-technology. my government will address issues pertaining to pricing and procurement of agricultural produce, crop insurance and post-harvest management. productivity of animal husbandry will be increased. my government will incentivize the setting up of food processing industries. existing cooperative sector laws will be reviewed to remove anomalies and lacunae. my government will adopt a

high priority to water security. it will complete the long pending irrigation projects on priority and launch the ‘pradhan mantri krishi sinchayee yojana’ with the motto of ‘har khet ko paani’. there is a need for seriously considering all options including linking of rivers, where feasible; for ensuring optimal use of our water resources to prevent the recurrence of floods and drought. by harnessing rain water through ‘jal sanchay’ and ‘jal sinchan’, we will nurture water conservation and ground water recharge. micro irrigation will be popularised to ensure ‘per drop-more crop’., honourable members, 12.india is the world’s oldest civilization. today it is also a country with the largest population of the youth. we must equip and nurture our youth with the right kind of education, skill-set and opportunity to reap this demographic dividend. my government will strive to transition from youth development to youth-led development. it will set up massive open online courses and virtual classrooms. it will formulate a national education policy aimed at meeting the challenges posed by lack of quality, research and innovation in our educational institutions. we will set up iits and iims in every state. in order to empower school teachers and students, a national e-library will be established. with the motto of “har haath ko hunar”, my government will strive to break the barriers between formal education and skill development, and put in place a mechanism to give academic equivalence to vocational qualifications. with the goal of skilled india, my government will also launch a national multi-skill mission., 13. the children and youth of the country need avenues of recreation that develop them constructively and keep them fit. my government will launch a ‘national sports talent search system’. it will facilitate development and promotion of indian sports, particularly rural sports. sports will be popularised by making it an integral part of the school curriculum and providing educational incentives., 14.our country needs a holistic health care system that is universally accessible, affordable and effective. to achieve this objective, my government

anniversary to be celebrated in the year 2019., 16.keeping in mind welfare of the people belonging to the scheduled castes, scheduled tribes, other backward classes and the weaker sections of our society; my government will take steps to create an enabling eco-system of equal opportunity in education, health and livelihood. my government is committed to see that those belonging to the scheduled castes and other backward classes are able to avail emerging opportunities. for the scheduled tribes, my government will launch a dedicated “van bandhu kalyan yojana”. electrification of tribal hamlets and connecting them with all-weather roads will be a priority area., 17.it is unfortunate that even after several decades of independence, sections of minority communities continue to suffer from poverty, as benefits of government schemes do not reach them. my government is committed to making all minorities equal partners in india’s progress. the government will especially strengthen measures to spread modern and technical education among minority communities and a national madarsa modernization programme will be initiated., 18.the welfare and rehabilitation of specially-abled people is integral to my government’s vision of a caring society. it will take steps to provide dignity of life to them by facilitating their participation in all walks of life. steps will be taken to identify their special needs and to provide institutional care to them., 19.my government recognizes the important role our women play in the development of our society and growth of the nation. it is committed to providing 33 per cent reservation to them in the parliament and state legislative assemblies. with a commitment of “beti bachao - beti padhao”, my government will launch a mass campaign for saving the girl child and enabling her education. it will structure a comprehensive scheme, incorporating best practices from states in this regard. in the recent past, the country has witnessed some grue some incidents of violence against women. the government will have a policy of zero tolerance for violence against women, and will strengthen the criminal justice system for its effective implementation., honourable members, 20.india is a federal polity. but, over the years, the federal spirit has been diluted. the states and the centre should function as an organic team india. in order to actively engage with the states on national issues, my government will reinvigorate fora like the national development council and the inter-state council. the centre will be an enabler in the rapid progress of states through cooperative federalism. state-specific development models will be developed taking into account the special needs and unique problems of coastal, hilly and desert areas. highest priority will be accorded to bring eastern region of the country on par with western region in terms of physical and social infrastructure. my government is committed to addressing the issues relating to development of andhra pradesh and telangana. the government will lay special emphasis on improving the intra-region connectivity and border infrastructure in the northeast as well as in jammu & kashmir. the issue of infiltration and illegal immigrants in the northeast region will be tackled on priority and all pending fencing work along the northeast border will be completed. special efforts will be made to ensure that kashmiri pandits return to the land of their ancestors with full dignity, security and assured livelihood., 21.my government is committed to providing a clean and efficient administration focussed on delivery. the institution of lok pal is important to curb corruption and my government will endeavour to formulate rules in conformity with the act. my government will take steps to build the confidence and morale of our bureaucracy; enabling it with the freedom to work, and welcoming innovative ideas. the government will stress on putting in place transparent systems and timebound delivery of government services. government systems and processes will be revisited to make them citizen friendly, corruption free and accountable.

vacancies in the judiciary and for doubling the number of courts and judges in the subordinate judiciary in a phased manner. the government will give special emphasis to the development of alternate dispute resolution mechanisms., honourable members, 25.on the economic front, we are passing through an extremely difficult phase. for two consecutive years, our gdp growth has been less than 5 per cent. tax collection has declined. inflation continues to be at an unacceptable level. thus, putting the indian economy back on track is paramount for my government. we will work together to usher our economy into a high growth path, rein in inflation, reignite the investment cycle, accelerate job creation and restore the confidence of the domestic as well as international community in our economy., 26.my government will create a policy environment which is predictable, transparent and fair. it will embark on rationalisation and simplification of the tax regime to make it non-adversarial and conducive to investment, enterprise and growth. my government will make every effort to introduce the gst while addressing the concerns of states. reforms will be undertaken to enhance the ease of doing business. my government will follow a policy of encouraging investments, including through fdi; which will be allowed in sectors that help create jobs and assets., 27.for

agro-based industries. my government will transform employment exchanges into career centres - connecting our youth with job opportunities in a transparent and effective manner through the use of technology as well as through counselling and training. the government will strengthen the pension and health insurance safety nets for labour force of all categories and would provide them access to modern financial services., 28.we need to transform ourselves into a globally competitive manufacturing hub powered by skill, scale and speed. to this end, the government will set up world class investment and industrial regions, particularly along the dedicated freight corridors and industrial corridors spanning the country. my government will encourage the domestic industry to innovate and collaborate internationally. it will strive to move towards a single-window system of clearances both at the centre and at the states through a hub-spoke model., 29.to strengthen our share in global

revamping of railways is on top of the infrastructure agenda. my government will launch a diamond quadrilateral project of high speed trains. the country will have a network of freight corridors with specialised agri-rail networks for perishable agricultural products. investment in railways will be increased using innovative financing methods. expansion of railways in hilly states and northeast region and modernization of rail safety systems will be prime focus areas. we will encourage r&d and high level local manufacturing for railway systems. a fast, time-bound and well monitored programme for execution of the national highways programme will be initiated, to overcome the stagnancy of the past few years. low cost airports will be developed to promote air connectivity to smaller towns. the government will evolve a model of port-led development. our long coastline will become the gateway for india’s prosperity. my government will facilitate modernization of existing ports on one hand, and development of new world class ports on the other. stringing together the sagar mala project we will connect the ports with the hinterland through road and rail. inland and coastal waterways will be developed as major transport routes., 31.my government will come out with a comprehensive national energy policy and focus on development of energy related infrastructure, human resource and technology. the aim of the government will be to substantially augment electricity generation capacity through judicious mix of conventional and non-conventional sources. it will expand the national solar mission and connect households and industries with gas-grids. reforms in the coal sector will be pursued with urgency for attracting private investment in a transparent manner. the international civil nuclear agreements will be operationalized and nuclear power projects for civilian purposes will be developed., 32.my government is conscious of the fact that our urban infrastructure is under severe stress. soon, 50 per cent of our population would be residing in urban areas. taking urbanization as an opportunity rather than a challenge, the government will build 100 cities focussed on specialized domains and equipped with world class amenities. integrated infrastructure will be rolled out in model towns to focus on cleanliness and sanitation. by the time the nation completes 75 years of its independence, every family will have a pucca house with water connection, toilet facilities, 24x7 electricity supply and access., honourable members, 33.while putting the country on a high growth path, my government will keep sustainability at the core of our planning process. my government strongly believes that environmental conservation can go hand in hand with development. to achieve this, environment and forest clearance systems will be made more predictable, transparent and time-bound. simultaneously, an effective system will be developed for sound appraisal processes and strict compliance of clearance conditions, especially those relating to rehabilitation of displaced communities and regeneration of forests. cleaner fuels will be promoted to bring down pollution levels in our cities. the government will earnestly take up mitigation works to meet the challenges posed by climate change and will closely work with the global community in this regard. conservation of himalayan ecology will be a priority area for my government. a national mission on himalayas will be launched., 34. in the recent past, serious concerns have been expressed regarding use of discretionary powers in allocation of our precious natural resources. the government will formulate clear and transparent policies on allocation of critical natural resources such as coal, minerals and spectrum., 35.river ganga is a part of our rich cultural heritage, a symbol of faith and the lifeline for millions. however, ganga continues to remain polluted with many stretches of the river becoming dry in lean season. my government will take all necessary steps to ensure a perennial, clean and pristine ganga., 36.our rich cultural heritage is the very foundation on which rests the unity of our diverse nation. indian languages are repositories of our rich literature, history, culture, art and other achievements. my government will launch a national mission “e-bhasha” that will develop digital vernacular content and disseminate our classic literature in different languages. my government will also provide the required resources for the maintenance and restoration of national heritage sites., 37.india has a vast untapped potential for tourism which can play a special role in our socio-economic progress. the government will initiate a mission mode project to create 50 tourist circuits that are built around specific themes. with a view to encouraging pilgrimage tourism, a national mission for beautifying and improving the amenities and infrastructure at pilgrimage centres of all faiths will be launched., 38.my government recognises the central role of science and technology in raising the quality of life. it will encourage and incentivise private sector investments, both domestic and foreign, in science and technology and in high-end research aimed at nurturing innovation. my government will build world class research centres in the fields of nanotechnology, material sciences, thorium technology, brain research, stem cells, etc. the government will also establish institutes of technology for rural development and a central university of himalayan studies., honourable members, 39.the government will maintain utmost vigil in the area of internal security. a policy of zero tolerance towards terrorism, extremism, riots and crime will be pursued. the states will be assisted for modernizing police infrastructure and equipment to tackle new forms of terrorism including narco terrorism and cyber threats. a national plan will be chalked out in consultation with the state governments to effectively curb incidents of communal violence and the challenges posed by left wing extremism. my government will take steps to equip the security forces with the latest technology and to improve their working conditions., 40.my government will carry out reforms in defence procurement to increase efficiency and economy. it will encourage domestic industry, including the private sector; to have a larger share in design and production of defence equipment. we will introduce policies to strengthen technology transfer, including through liberalised fdi in defence production. with readily available skilled human resource, india can emerge as a global platform for defence manufacturing including software, which will strengthen our defence and spur industrial development as well as exports., 41.the country is proud of its armed forces. they serve the nation with professionalism, dedication and valour; securing our nation and supporting relief and rescue operations in the wake of disasters and calamities. we will strengthen defence preparedness by modernising our armed forces and addressing the shortage of manpower on priority. recognising the importance of coastal security, my government will set up a national maritime authority., 42.my government will do everything to repay the debt of our brave and selfless soldiers. it will appoint a veterans commission to address their grievances, so that they know that we don’t stop caring for them when they retire from active service. the government will build a national war memorial to honour the gallantry of our soldiers. one rank, one pension scheme will be implemented., honourable members, 43.india’s foreign policy, with its civilizational roots and heritage, is based on the principles of developing peaceful and friendly relations with all countries. we will pursue our international engagement based on enlightened national interest, combining the strength of our values with pragmatism, leading to a doctrine of mutually beneficial relationships. my government is committed to building a strong, self-reliant and self-confident india; regaining its rightful place in the comity of nations., 44.my government sent a unique and bold signal to the south asian region and the world, by inviting for the first time in independent india, leaders of all south asian neighbours to the swearing-in ceremony of the new council of ministers on may 26. we are grateful to them for accepting the invitation at such a short notice. their participation, as also the gracious presence of the prime minister of mauritius; not only added sheen to the ceremony, but also represented a celebration of democracy in the region and convergence of our shared hopes and aspirations. this shows my government’s commitment and determination to work towards building a peaceful, stable and economically inter-linked neighbourhood which is essential for the collective development and prosperity of the south asian region. we will further work together with south asian leaders to revitalise saarc as an effective instrument for regional cooperation and as a united voice on global issues., 45.at the same time, we will never shy away from raising issues of concern to us at a bilateral level. we emphasize that the future of shared prosperity can only be built on the foundation of stability in the region, which requires sensitivity to security concerns and an end to export of terrorism to neighbours., 46.my government will engage energetically with other neighbours in our region, including china, with whom we will work to further develop our strategic and cooperative partnership. we will strive to make progress in the many initiatives that are ongoing with japan, especially in the field of building modern infrastructure in our country. russia remains a privileged and strategic partner and my government will build further on the firm foundations of

2014-08-16,ushering in a new era,"language of virtue: prime minister narendra modi’s speech is not the language of politics but of virtue, of the qualities required for nation building. picture shows him addressing the nation from the ramparts of the red fort on independence day. photo: sandeep saxena | photo credit: sandeep saxena , sometimes a nation creates the new by restating the old. it is an act of symbolic gardening, where dead clichés once again become live values, where unity is no longer equated with unanimity but with inclusiveness. a new frame recreates a new nation. one could see it semiotically in the staging of >narendra modi’s august 15 address., announcing a new erathe languor and still life speeches of manmohan singh’s era had to be forgotten. first mr. modi enters exuding confidence. he knows he has to announce a new era. he goes beyond nehruvianism by appealing to the civics of swadeshi. this is not the language of politics but of virtue, of the qualities required for nation building. he is attired in a saffron turban with a green border: a bandhini, kutchi in its origin. he evokes a new style and his voice resonates a different world. india is not making tryst with destiny. it is going to meet the future by reconstructing it. the camera widens the frame. lal quila is not just a fortress. it is a landscape of temples, history and a sense of a bigger city. he is standing at the ramparts announcing a new era by reworking the grammar of the old. there is no big statement on productivity, no appeal to economics, no cliché about foreign policy, no reference to corruption, hardly any mention of china or pakistan. it is a day for positives, for a nation to recharge itself. the language is simple: it is not politics, not policy; it is a simple sermon on values, simply done, almost faultless., this independence day speech does not begin with 1947. it begins with a salute to those who build the nation. the first shift in attitude is here. mr. modi says, “i address you not as prime minister but as the first servant of the nation.” he then suggests a nation is not made by a great man but by its people. a nation is built by its soldiers, its farmers, its youth, its workers, its teachers, its scientists, its martyrs. politicians and government don’t build a nation; they merely rule it. a salute to a people is a salute to ancestors and predecessors. suddenly you realise that mr. modi is making the transition from politician to statesman. there is little reference to the parochial and the divisive. a speech is tailor-made for the occasion. the hectoring battles of party politics yield to measured rhetoric. this nation, like mr. modi, has many selves and he is appealing to the best of each., he begins autobiographically. he says he came to delhi as an outsider where an elite class treated him as an untouchable. but in two months, he got an insider view which was devastating. he talks of a labyrinth called delhi where each department stands like an empire. there are governments inside the government and worse, department battles before the supreme court. unity breaks because of divisiveness of bureaucracies., he moves to a softer reflective tone. he refers to punctuality — to the people’s surprise that clerks are punctual, that offices open on time. he then remarks that if this new punctuality is news, then we as a nation should be embarrassed about ourselves, about the depths we have fallen into., he refers to the new individualism which asks, “what is in it for me?” he answers: everything is not for the individual. the individual does not exhaust the nation. the social needs other solidarities and one can hear in this voice all the pracharak strains from the past. the nation is the ultimate construct of the social. he shifts gears. a nation without civics, responsibility and freedom is empty., he talks of rape. he says when a daughter reaches ten, the parents play out the politics of anxiety, asking her where she is going, when she will return. the mobile phone is perpetually on, tracking her movement. but then, he says, there is not a word about the son, about his behaviour, where he goes, who he meets. if the victim is a woman who needs to belong to a family, so is the rapist. parents need to ask sons what they are up to. to think of rape only as a wider problem is not adequate. rapes too begin at home., he begins with rape to talk of the position of women, of the place of daughters in our lives. he says a man with one loving daughter is better off than a man with five sons in old age because a daughter will never abandon her parents. he lashes out at foeticide, hinting that a society that values sons will be a society with old age homes., he wants a society proud of women’s achievements and cites the medal haul of our athletes as a sign of the new achievement. one senses he is not talking of rights, of freedoms, but about institutions, responsibilities and duties., the shift from family to governance is fluid. he makes a folklore distinction between a man in a private industry describing his work as “a job” and a man in government calling his work “service.” mr. modi emphasises the idea of service. service is civilisational. it is not a secular idea of employment. english does not capture service. service is the ability to prioritise the other. it goes beyond the individualism of careers, a point the prime minister borrows from vivekananda., he then examines the innards of society, claiming a decent society cannot ignore the fact of agricultural suicides. he then promises an india where every farmer has a bank account and every family an insurance of rs. one lakh., from farmers dying to unemployed youth, mr. modi returns to his favourite project: the re-skilling of youth. skill is what gives employment, what makes india mobile across the globe. organised skill is manufacture and it is manufacture that has to be the core of dynamic india. he gives it a step slogan: “no defect, no effect.” a product should be of high quality and should be environmentally sensitive. such a product will take india to the world of global excellence. “made in india” becomes the new dream of swadeshi., he talks of his dream of a digital india — not a network for the rich, but a digital india for the poor where digitality helps development, and where e-governance is easy, effective and economical., to a digital india, he adds a tourist india, portraying tourism as that inclusivity which provides employment for the poor, for the channawala, the pakoda seller, the chaiwala. he adds that what stands in the way of tourism is dirt. it is interesting mr. modi begins with dirt rather than corruption. the word he uses is swatchtha (cleanliness) — cleanliness as a mentality, an activity, as a way of life. interestingly, the values mr. modi brings in are civilisational values like seva (service) swatchtha. he is indigenising a way of life with a vocabulary that is civilisational. he invokes corporate social responsibility, not for some fancy dream, but asks corporates to use their wealth to create toilets in schools, including a separate toilet for the girl. the tenor of the speech of a prime minister talking about sanitation, dirt, toilets, cleanliness is almost gandhian. this is an attempt to evoke an everyday civics which replaces empty policy as the first step to development., the burial of an institutionyet, those who are waiting for a word about policy are not fully disappointed. mr. modi refers to the planning commission. he talks of it as an institution which was adequate for its time but then dismantles it like a magician, hinting that the commission was anachronistic. india needed a new institution with a new soul, sensitive to federalism. it is the quickest burial of an institution one has witnessed. a whole vision, a whole network of vested interests and academic cronyism collapses before mr. modi. the new governance makes its first step with the death of the planning commission.",0.08259621212121213,ushering new era,"language virtue : prime minister narendra modi ’

2014-09-06,watch your waste,"dumping waste into pallikaranai marsh in chennai. , “sanitation was unheard of. water was unpurified, and raw sewage ran down city streets in open drains. it was common practice for people to empty their chamber pots out of their windows, and to leave garbage out in the street to rot… cesspools of human waste collected in puddles everywhere. dead animals (dogs, cats, rodents, even horses) were left to decay in the streets.”, “many of the cobblestone streets were very filthy with accumulations of manure from the horses that traversed them. dead dogs, cats, and rats littered the streets. household and vegetable refuse collected in the cracks of the cobblestones to the depths of three feet or more in the winter. so-called garbage boxes were rarely emptied, and they overflowed with awful animal carcasses and household waste.”, in his independence day speech prime minister narendra modi strongly espoused the idea that one of the biggest obstacles in the formation of our national character is the filth that surrounds us. this, as he himself recognised, would seem to be an uncharacteristic and trivial matter for the prime minister to weigh upon on the most important day in the nation’s history. nevertheless, he thinks it is critical enough to ask 125 countrymen to “resolve not to leave a speck of dirt in our village, city, street, area, school, temple, hospital...”, there are a couple of fundamental problems with the prime minister’s exhortation. first, it makes it seem that dirt and filth is merely a cultural problem, a defect in the national character that can be rectified by moral reform alone. thus he asks: “if the countrymen decide that they will never spread filthiness, which power in the world has ability to spread filthiness in our cities and villages?” this leads to a narrow understanding of filth as dirt and litter spread carelessly by the common people, which, among other things, become a major barrier to promoting tourism as modi emphasised. and second, modi’s good intentions of cleaning up the country are at complete odds with the other thrust of his address which wants to see india as a world power by making it a manufacturing and digital hub, and a tourism destination., if modi had looked at the evolution of human history, he would have realised that cleanliness and attitudes towards filth cannot simply be extricated from larger societal processes and seen in isolation from economic, political and medical-scientific contexts. if this were not the case, we would have mistaken the two descriptions that we started with to be that of some putrefying third world cities. but they are not; instead, they are of london and new york, the two of the greatest modern cities, in the 18 and 19 century respectively. understanding this big and long-term picture of how societies come to be what they are is vital. this does not mean that piecemeal changes like adoption of better hygiene and sanitation, an absolutely critical issue in india, without larger socio-economic transformations will not prevent the loss of easily savable lives. after all, diarrhea is the second leading cause of death of children under the age of five worldwide — 2,195 children every day — more than aids, malaria and measles put together., nevertheless, cleanliness is not only about adopting better practices of hygiene but also about confronting the gigantic nightmare of filth in the form of trash and waste (and all manner of pollutants) produced presently in the process of production and consumption. by ignoring this aspect of the production of filth, modi is missing the picture. filth is wrongly associated only with poverty and backwardness. but, actually, as i had argued in an earlier article, “one thing that is symptomatic of the modern human condition, but hardly recognised as such… is garbage.” waste is an almost inalienable byproduct of urbanisation and industrialisation driven by capitalism. urban residents now produce as much as four times the waste of rural inhabitants, and developed countries produce far more waste than the developing nations., if in 1900, the 13 per cent of the world population who lived in cities produced 300,000 tons of trash per day, presently, world’s urban population, numbering 50 per cent, produces 3.5 million tons of solid waste (and this does not even include industrial and hazardous waste). daniel hoornweg, who co-authored a world bank report on waste, estimates that this figure would reach 11 million tons by 2100! the urban population would, of course, be 70 per cent by 2050., in this context of unbridled production and consumption of goods as well as production of trash with grave human and ecological costs, it is extraordinary that modi appeals to the world: “come, make in india,” “come, manufacture in india,” everything — automobiles, plastics, submarines and satellites. basically, it is a call to traverse the path already trodden by the western countries in the beginning, followed by japan and s. east asian countries later, and china in the present, all leaving an almost irrevocable trail of destruction in its wake. thus, for example, in america, after two centuries of industrial “progress”, 40 per cent of its waters are rendered unfit for fishing or swimming, two million children are susceptible to neurological damage caused by heightened lead levels and one million cancers could be caused by pesticides in food alone., of course, the prime minister wants us to “manufacture goods with zero effect” on the environment. but, pray, where in history is an example for such a win-win developmental utopia? or where in india are signs even remotely recognising the need for an environmentally sustainable mode of production as well as waste disposal? this call to manufacture with zero effect is even more ironic when, as commentators have pointed out, the union environment ministry has only recently diluted the already weak regulations existing with regard to mining, road construction, power and irrigation projects including the requirement to seek consent of the gram sabhas, while mining in forest areas!, the grandest of the prime minister’s dreams are about the making of a “digital india” which would establish e-governance, especially for the rural citizens. but will “digital india” tread gently on our planet and eliminate all the filth that surrounds us? this utopia too does not seem to be materialising. while the production of electronic goods is itself enormously energy and resource intensive (it takes 2800 gallons of water and 700, mainly hazardous, chemical compounds, to produce one pc), electronic waste is the fastest growing component of waste in the world. according to the un’s step initiative, the volume of e-waste — which contains toxic material like lead, cadmium, nickel, mercury and arsenic — will weigh as much as eight of the great egyptian pyramids by 2017., this is not surprising in an age in which we are asked to “think different” just by buying the latest mobile phones and computers. an estimated 300 million computers and 1 billion mobile phones are produced annually. a 2009 report by un’s environment program projects e-waste in india from computers to go up by five times, and from mobile phones by 18 times by 2020. what do we do with this waste? the developed nations can dump them in landfills, or just dump huge quantities of their e-waste on the poorer nations leaving them to deal with it along with their own. where do we dump ours?, what kind of a “digital india” does the prime minister have in mind when 90 per cent of e-waste is recycled in the country in the informal sector with a non-existent legal framework? here, poorly paid workers work in the most hazardous of conditions contaminating themselves and their surroundings. what dreams are we asking the 4.5-lakh children working with e-waste to dream when they are unwittingly sacrificing their lives for our digital future?, finally, when modi stresses tourism as a magic wand which will give “employment to the poorest of the poor,” he ignores that global tourism, and the resultant increased air travel is a major contributor to climate change. without a simultaneous emphasis on sustainable tourism, the increased tourist flock to india will only be

2014-10-19,the valley in digital india,"illustration: deepak harichandan , over the course of the last few weeks, the ceos of silicon valley unveiled the latest frontier to be conquered in india. products and strategies are out. what’s in is humanitarian ventures, empowering indians and helping prime minister narendra modi implement his digital india initiative., facebook ceo mark zuckerberg, for example, pointed out during his recent visit the similarities between the company’s ‘internet.org’ project and mr. modi’s vision of boosting digital infrastructure, bringing internet access to all citizens and providing online government services., microsoft chief executive satya nadella, who made his first trip to india a week before mr. zuckerberg arrived, similarly underscored the role of microsoft and technology in spurring growth. “we are keen to partner with government and industry at large to help make this vision a reality,” the newly-appointed ceo said in a media interview., google has also announced that it would want to help the government accelerate its digital india agenda. some of the company’s initial plans involve helping millions of women get online and also building the non-english internet base., to be sure, there is much to be gained by incorporating silicon valley expertise into boosting digital infrastructure and backing that up with online government services. providing affordable, high-quality broadband will involve overcoming years of terrible government implementation and bureaucratic inefficiency. refusing help would not only seem arrogant, but could also be downright stupid., and yet, there are other less obvious subtexts that must be carefully read. the most obvious question is whether technology companies are altruistic enough to work towards international development without it involving a potential pay-off. and even if digital india and that pay-off could be intertwined, what sort of development would we see?, consider facebook’s internet.org project, the long-stated goal of which is to help in providing affordable and universal internet access. one of the ways the initiative achieves is this by cobbling together a package of ‘useful’ applications — which usually includes the facebook app — and offers them for essentially free. the data charges are subsidised by cutting deals with telecom operators., not only does this violate the principles of net neutrality by introducing a preferential pricing structure — therefore, discriminating against companies that are not included in the internet.org project — but it also inserts facebook as a middleman for applications that have nothing to do with the social networking site, such as education or health., this kind of ‘technological solutionism’ approach towards issues of inequality also helps us ignore the reasons behind that particular inequality. if problems of health and education can be solved with an app, why worry about why the government has failed to provide decent facilities in the first place? similarly, why think about alternative ways of providing universal broadband access when companies can negotiate complex arrangements that will almost certainly fail to represent the interests of the whole ecosystem? but more than that, what digital india has failed to articulate, in an age of mass internet surveillance, is a conceptualisation of india’s data and digital sovereignty. after all, if there was one thing that the edward snowden episode showed us, it was that the ‘global internet’ is actually quite american — from the tapped cables to the compromised silicon valley companies., there are different approaches towards digital sovereignty: china, for instance, has systematically blocked most of silicon valley, and has instead encouraged the creation of its own internet companies. the success of alibaba at the new york stock exchange, as the wall street journal put it, has only cemented how the internet power balance is slowly turning towards asia., brazil, on the other hand, is more concerned with how the data of its citizens are handled by companies such as google and microsoft. president dilma rousseff recently took the first steps in pushing for a law that would require foreign cloud service providers to store brazilian data on servers hosted in brazil., india, on the other hand, is far behind in terms of articulating a domestic vision. in a paper titled ‘an internet with brics characteristics: data sovereignty and the balkanisation of the internet’, university of oxford professors joss wright and dana polatin-reuben highlight the practical non-existence of india’s stance., “it is worth noting that india appears to be most interested in safeguarding the data of its western investors, rather than asserting sovereignty over its own nationally-generated data. for instance, india and the united kingdom entered into a cyber-pact in 2012 with the aim of protecting british data stored in indian data centres... india is more likely to take a western approach to data sovereignty than a sino-russian approach,” the authors write., digital india, it appears, has little imagination when it comes to envisioning a digital india. one way of getting our citizens online would have google sign them up for a gmail account — why shouldn’t the other way also have india post provide them with digital cloud and e-mail facilities?, in europe, postal operators such as germany’s deutsche post and france’s la poste are providing limited e-mail and ‘digital locker’ services that allow citizens to store and send important documentation such as tax returns, insurance bills and bank statements. the idea is that users can have their ‘public information’ — which in most cases the government already has handled by public services and use private technology companies for their other communication and productivity needs.",0.025425722236946724,valley digital india,"illustration : deepak harichandan , course last weeks , ceos silicon valley unveiled latest frontier conquered india. products strategies out. ’ humanitarian ventures , empowering indians helping prime minister narendra modi implement digital india initiative. , facebook ceo mark zuckerberg , example , pointed recent visit similarities company ’ ‘internet.org ’ project mr. modi ’ vision boosting digital infrastructure , bringing internet access citizens providing online government services. , microsoft chief executive satya nadella , made first trip india week mr. zuckerberg arrived , similarly underscored role microsoft technology spurring growth. “we keen partner government industry large help make vision reality , ” newly-appointed ceo said media interview. , google also announced would want help government accelerate digital india agenda. company ’ initial plans involve helping millions women get online also building non-english internet base. , sure , much gained incorporating silicon valley expertise boosting digital infrastructure backing online government services. providing affordable , high-quality broadband involve overcoming years terrible government implementation bureaucratic inefficiency. refusing help would seem arrogant , could also downright stupid. , yet , less obvious subtexts must carefully read. obvious question whether technology companies altruistic enough work towards international development without involving potential pay-off. even digital india pay-off could intertwined , sort development would see?

2014-11-01,recalibrating india’s foreign policy,"indian border security force (bsf) soldiers patroling near the line of control (loc). | photo credit: mukesh gupta , prime minister narendra modi has now interacted with the leaders of four of the five countries/regions — saarc, china, japan, russia, and u.s. — on the list of foreign policy priorities mentioned in the president’s address to the opening session of parliament. it is, therefore, an appropriate time to take stock of the underlying changes in the directions of india’s foreign policy. in other words, is mr. modi’s foreign policy likely to differ from that of sonia gandhi-manmohan singh?, every country’s foreign policy has elements of continuity and change following a change in government. india’s policy under mr. modi is no different. the changes have not necessarily been explicitly articulated, but are implicit in the government’s actions and view of the world., there are five areas of the emerging change: the centrality given to economic and technological development; the orientation of domestic and foreign policies toward this objective; the emphasis on national power including military power; and stress on soft power; and a reduction in self-imposed constraints on actions that other countries may construe as inimical to their interests., changes in foreign policy the first change in foreign policy relates to the greater attention provided to economic objectives. this is not a mere reiteration of the economic development objective that has been india’s mantra since independence but recognition of the role of technology (broadly defined) in all aspects of economic development. this involves an implicit benchmarking of the technological capabilities of the indian economy with the global best practices; having a perception of the gaps; and setting the goal of bridging these gaps., the government’s divergence from the policies of the previous regimes is reflected in two initiatives, the swachh bharat abhiyan and the digital india campaign, both of which involve the use of appropriate technology., “aggression along the border is being countered by bold moves like the decision to construct a ‘mcmahon highway’ in arunachal pradesh”, this is probably the first time that an indian prime minister has explained india’s economic and technological objectives abroad — ‘india first’; has identified the specific role each country could play in achieving these objectives — for instance u.s. and japan; and has made that the centrepiece of his discussion with the leaders of that country. ‘india first’ means that india’s requirements — when it comes to various areas like basic sanitation, defence and space technology — will be expressed with greater clarity and specificity to other countries., the second change relates to a much greater orientation of domestic and foreign policies toward those objectives. the indian prime minister has been very explicit about indian objectives with respect to economic development and technological catch-up and in exploring how domestic and international policies will be used to close the gaps across the entire spectrum. its decisions will then be based on a cost-benefit analysis on a defined set of parameters, not on ideological considerations like that of non-alignment., the third change is with respect to a greater emphasis on overall national power — recognising that economic power is its foundation, but also giving a greater role to military power., the modi government appreciates that economic power cannot be a substitute for military power in deterring aggression from the ideologically driven foes. on the contrary, economic assistance can be viewed by military ideologues as an expression of superiority to be resented. economic relations can complement international security relationships by influencing the behaviour of non-ideological, economically rational players in the global system but only military strength can deter militaristic ideologues and ensure peace., operationally, this has two important implications. one is a clearer appreciation of all the dimensions of external threat, particularly unconventional threats. this requires a build-up of world-class equipment and skills over a much wider spectrum of warfare and covert capabilities and a willingness to boldly attack the aggressor in his safe havens. this is already happening both in terms of enhancing capabilities in counter-terrorism and in defence against non-state actors; and, more importantly, in doctrines incorporating a willingness to take calculated risks in using asymmetric capabilities., on deterrence deterrence is however only effective if the adversary is convinced that the new government will respond to asymmetric warfare with appropriate action spread across a much broader spectrum of conventional and unconventional options. when diplomatic moves sent to our western neighbour, like the track-2 dialogue, did not have any impact on ‘deep state’, it became necessary to bring about a change in the overall strategy through a heightened conventional response to border firing/ceasefire violations., similarly, unconventional psychological warfare and ‘creeping annexation’ tactics along the northern border are being countered by bolder plans — like the decision to construct a ‘mcmahon highway’ along lac in arunachal — that have both conventional and symbolic components., the second implication is a much greater focus on national capability to produce a broad range of defence equipment in india. ‘self-sufficiency’ has been a slogan from the days of nehruvian socialism, but it played second fiddle to the ideological goal of preserving public sector’s monopoly over the means of (defence) production. this is being decisively broken., the ability and willingness to transfer technology and help build skills and research capabilities at lower costs will consequently play a much more important role in our relations with japan, russia, u.s. and eu countries. this reinvigorated approach to national security is likely to manifest itself in a reversal of the trend of decline in ratio of defence expenditures to gdp., the fourth change is a greater emphasis on ‘soft power’. mr. modi’s speech to the indian diaspora in new york was a successful attempt to inspire them to contribute to the country’s economic and technological development., the fifth change is a freeing up of self-imposed, historical and mental constraints on developing the relationship with any country to its full potential. thus, india’s economic relationship with potential adversaries can be independent of its security relationship. this is reflected in developments like the economic agreements reached between mr. modi and chinese president xi jingping, the formation of the brics bank and aiib (asian infrastructure investment bank). further, the relationship with one country will not constrain that with others — cooperation with china will not affect that with japan. both will be evaluated in terms of india’s objectives of building national power., pragmatic reset of policy mr. modi’s pragmatic reset of policy toward the u.s. reflects this change in overall approach. the u.s. is still the sole superpower and stands head and shoulders above others in the depth and breadth of its strategic and defence technology. it is also a major source of technology, capital and export markets for the indian private sector., there are, however, inherent differences in perspective between a rich global power and a poor regional one: u.s. is a net exporter of technology with high per-capita pollution while india is a net technology importer with high incremental pollution., a pragmatic approach seems to be emerging to resolving these differences and to minimise the negative fallout of unresolved differences and focus on areas of convergence like counter-terrorism and maritime security in and around the indian ocean.",0.10667940392940392,recalibrating india ’ foreign policy,"indian border security force ( bsf ) soldiers patroling near line control ( loc ) . &#124;

2015-01-23,"modi, obama carry burden of expectations","artist jagjot singh rubal gives final touches on a painting of u.s. president barack obama in amritsar on friday. mr. obama arrives in new delhi on sunday and will be the first american president to attend republic day celebrations on january 26. , when u.s. president barack obama touches down in new delhi on air force one this weekend both he and his chief indian interlocutor, prime minister narendra modi, will carry a heavy burden of expectations upon their shoulders., while some may be distracted by the “optics” of their second meeting, which includes a republic day salute to mr. obama from india’s armed forces, a visit to raj ghat, a state dinner, a ceos forum discussion and a speech by the american president, long-time observers of the bilateral space will be watching for breakthroughs in the broad policy agenda., boost to defence cooperation, the view appears optimistic in one area of cooperation above all others – defence trade. sadanand dhume of washington’s american enterprise institute suggested to the hindu that the promise for the most dramatic gains could be found in this sphere, even more so after “notoriously inert” former defence minister a.k. antony was replaced by the “dynamic” manohar parrikar of the bjp government., here unintentional reciprocity may have brought the right partners to the table on both sides as the new u.s. defence secretary ashton carter is reputed to be a man who fundamentally supports deeper engagement with india, in a way that some of his predecessors did not., could the last year’s defence trade and technology initiative be the fertile ground that yields the much-needed moment of bilateral epiphany?, milan vaishnav of the carnegie endowment for international peace argued that with fresh momentum imparted to the talks by these leaders there is a “reasonable chance” that two sides will come to agreement on a deal to co-produce and co-develop a new piece of defence hardware, defying the long-standing bugaboo of technology transfer and attendant insecurities., economy a core concern, trade and investment in some ways comprise the very heart of the india-u.s. engagement, at least since mr. modi took over at the helm in south block., with the two nations meeting in november for the trade policy forum, launching an infrastructure collaboration platform in december and discussing the “formidable” goals of the prime minister’s digital india vision this month, the space has seen a flurry of activity aimed to consolidating the economic partnership even further., notwithstanding the promise of this economic diplomacy and the hope that the gradual lifting of foreign direct investment caps in india will create jobs from seattle to sriperumbudur, some lingering concerns remain., among these, as u.s. assistant secretary of state for economic and business affairs charles rivkin said at several forums here in recent weeks, there is a view that the intellectual property rights protection regime in india is “philosophically” different to its u.s. counterpart., while the broad expectation is that ipr and trade protection concerns are unlikely to go away any time soon, the action that truly set alarm bells ringing in washington’s beltway appears to be the signalling effect of india’s refusal to sign the world trade organisation’s trade facilitation agreement until an agreement was reached on food subsidies., in this regard, mr. dhume says, “though the u.s. and india have resolved their disagreement over the wto’s tfa, india has ended up reinforcing its image among u.s. trade officials as a spoiler on global trade.”, although getting the tfa back on track was an important step, there are a host of thorny issues, including trade protectionism, ipr and immigration and, “the biggest thing obama is seeking is credible reassurance on the economic reform front,” noted mr. vaishnav., how to assure washington of this commitment to continued liberalisation?, in the short and medium term mr. obama may broadly seek assurances that the prime minister’s economic nationalism is not a “synonym for renewed protectionism,” and it may help if the indian government continued to prioritise fdi flows and improve the ease of doing business., in the longer term the obama white house and any administration occupying that building after 2016 will be looking to ensure that american companies can partner with india on mega-scale economic initiatives such as “make in india” and “digital india.”, civil nuclear dilemma, the 2008 civilian nuclear cooperation agreement between india and the u.s., which used to be the barometer of goodwill between the nations and was a de facto nod to indian exceptionalism, has gotten mired in the tussle over india’s nuclear liability act and has witnessed much hand-wringing around the use of administrative rules to limit supplier liability in the event of an accident., could the modi-obama parleys resolve this riddle of the sphinx over a weekend?, the view in washington seems to be this: it may not matter., praise, or at least cautious optimism, is already accruing to the modi government for adopting a “problem solving approach” especially given the obama administration’s frustrations with the perceived intransigence of some in the upa-ii regime on the liability question., meeting of minds?, finally a factor that may have a strong influence on the outcomes of bilateral engagement, even if it is not officially a part of the agenda, is the chemistry between mr. modi and mr. obama., while the two men are viewed by some as the odd couple of global politics, mr. dhume argues, “nobody would have predicted that the bookish former law professor would find common ground with the business-friendly former rss pracharak but the two leaders do appear to have developed a degree of personal warmth toward each other.”, ultimately, the consensus here appears to be, it is common interests, whether maintaining the balance of power in asia, developing india's economy or combating terrorism, that drive the bonhomie between mr. obama and

2015-01-28,chat - as it happened: obama's india visit,"varghese george (national and political affairs editor); amit baruah (resident editor, new delhi) ; suhasini haidar (diplomatic and strategic affairs editor); narayan lakshman (the hindu's u.s. correspondent); puja mehra (special correspondent) share their insights and answer readers' questions relating to mr. obama's india visit, the hindu: welcome to the hindu's live chat on us president obama's visit to india. following mr. obama's visit , it is time to understand what this historic visit means for india, for the u.s., this region and more importantly for the people of both countries, the hindu: did you know that mr. obama was the first u.s. president to be the chief guest at the republic day? read the top 10 highlights of the president's visit here: http://www.thehindu.com/news/top-10-highlights-of-obamas-visit-to-india/article6826353.ece, comment from veera reddy: “mann ki bath” would have been great if modi allowed obama more time to speak......disappoited......, a: amit baruah: welcome to the hindu's live chat on the obama visit. keep your questions coming, you have the hindu's top brass waiting to respond, suhasini haidar: good morning all….welcome to the hindu live chat…happy to take your questions and comments!, q: with new big investments in economy and infrastructure on the anvil, can we expect to see as a fundamental principle, the upholding of environmental and industrial safety, risk management in all the new developments?, puja mehra: good morning all, q: was there talks about the h1 visa and outsourcing? when can we get what was discussed in detail?, suhasini haidar: they did talk..president obama said he had “noted india's concerns” so expect it to come up once they launch the bilateral investment talks as well, narayan lakshman: welcome folks. this is narayan lakshman,the hindu's u.s. correspondent., q: after out come of us india meetings is there any time lines mentioned or target dates announced on e.g smart cities. neuclear power, solar engery...etc, a: suhasini haidar: not yet…on nuclear issues, india is expected to reply “within days” on us concerns over reading the liability law. on solar energy, its still a broad, not significant commitment. but under pace and peace programmes, expect something before november!, a: narayan lakshman: on timeline for the nuclear deal, i would add that it may be much longer before any investment in u.s.-made reactors is finalised, particularly because the u.s. nuclear companies like westinghouse and ge need to make their own risk assessments based on the pooled insurance formula that has been put on the table by the indian side. if they decide that the premium costs would result in too high a price of power generated, it may require further negotiations., comment from gubi : i think there was more hype about this visit in india,us media did not pay any heed to visit., q: what are the main benefits india will have after obama's visit?, comment: absolute nil coverage in major usa tv evening news of nbc, cbs & abc of obamas india visit!, a: suhasini haidar: really….well thats quite surprising, given the optics of the visit. but maybe thats how it often is, a: narayan lakshman: i agree. there's a view that u.s. media is predominantly focused on domestic concerns, which i would attest to, to an extent. having said that the print media here did offer more coverage than television, with pretty much every major publication following the visit in real time., q: i have the opinion that us media did not give much attention for this visit primarily as they don't see this visit of importance in strategy. they consider this visit as a wooing by india to improve its relations with usa. however, the indian perspective is that during obama's visit india has already accomplished some crucial breakthrough in terms of us aid and us support politically for india. what is your take on this?, a: suhasini haidar: i think it is a significant visit, but it will take some weeks, maybe months to see just what was achieved. if the big picture is that us and india are now heading towards an alliance, that might face a backlash…but as partners going forward, they can achieve a lot, a: amit baruah: responses from pakistan and the official chinese media are interesting. they suggest that the obama visit has had more than the “optical” impact regionally, q: is the us congress behind obama on his act east policy with respect to india ???, a: narayan lakshman: yes, i believe it is, in the sense that india is by and large considered a country with bipartisan support here. further, the u.s. congress (or specific members) has (have) often been more concerned about the rise of china than the white house has. so they can be expected to back most of obama's policies on india in east asia., q: suhasini, will india really go with usa in fighting against terrorism? and against isis? by sending combating troops.., a: suhasini haidar: i doubt that praveen! isis is something india has shied away from commenting on. but they need to have real cooperation, as equals. see my piece if possible in today’s @thehindu on jud ., a: narayan lakshman: this is a really good question, and one that many in the media are not picking up. i think the obama administration must have been hoping for some greater involvement by india -- but it has not been forthcoming. in some sense, there is a standoff brewing in that regard -- us refusing to mention let, jud in joint statement, as suhasini said, and india not yielding on the fight against isis/is/daesh, q: was the obama speech against putin prompted by a afp journalist warranted?, a: amit baruah: obama's comments on russia were quite deliberate. they were an effort to show that once friendly to russia-ussr india was now a stage that could be used against moscow. that, to me, was the broad purpose of his comments against russia., q: need clarification about the supplier liability in n-deal after this visit., a: suhasini haidar: yes i agree, vivek!, q: suhasini - when he spoke about freedom of religion... what and how is it seen by the ruling party., puja mehra: the task forces appointed on the agreement to develop smart cities will give their reports in three months time.., q: suhasini , why the news that india has been endorsed for un security counsil permanent seat by usa , is not making much news ? i read in dawn about the concern raised by pakistan security adviser on this and other but why this is not in news here ?, a: suhasini haidar: not the first time president obama has made the statement….he said “we hope to see a reformed unsc in which india has a seat”. but no process for reform is in play yet. 10:09, a: puja mehra: they will submit concrete plans for development, funding required, q: how is us going to gain from the nuclear deal with india considering that all the major corporations like mitsubishi and all from other countries., a: narayan lakshman: the u.s. has quite a lot to gain, in terms of jobs created here by deals involving westinghouse and ge. further there it cements the strategic bond with india further as this policy was the “centrepiece” of the relationship since 2005., q: what about totalisation agreement of 3 billion indian money that is tied up in us social security?, a: narayan lakshman: this has apparently returned to the negotiating table during obama's visit, having reached a stand-still for several years now, since the upa gov. still unclear if any rapid resolution of the issues is possible, as it hinges upon taxation (and other financial) systems of the two nations becoming more closely coordinated (and right now they're not), q: will this mean indian troops in afghanistan, syria, yemen, central asia and congo. i mean unofficially bypassing the un, a: amit baruah: nope, don't think so abraham. closer military cooperation with the us will not amount to that. there are no indications to suggest that now., q: how do you think china india relations will play out in next 4-5 years? india-us bhai-bhai and china-india ---- (what?), a: suhasini haidar: i think pm modi has taken a very definitive stand on countering china over the past few months in relns with japan, australia, vietnam and the us. this is going to make our engagement with china, which is india's largest trading partner tricky. eam sushma swaraj is heading to beijing next week, pm modi will probably go later this year, so hopefully this will be managed., q: will india's dream of securing a seat in un security council materialise?, q: is there any merit in china's warning of “trap” by usa?, a: amit baruah: the chinese have concerns about the india-us tango in the region -- that's clear from their media editorials. the “trap” , however, could be in the chinese mind alone., a: puja mehra: president obama did say that us companies saw an opportunity in india's infrastructure development plans. on make in india he said the steps india was taking for improving the ease of doing business were a step in the right direction. he said us companies would like to see more done on intellectual rights protection., q: apart from all the deals and other shining things, we the indians, as strong supporters of democracy and human rights, did not dare anytime (either our visit to us or their visit to us) to discuss issues of human massacres in the name of regime change in palestine, syria etc. supported by us. this same us doesnt want to bring democracy in saudi arabia as that is its ally. this double standard of us is well accepted and cherished by all. obama is welcomed everywhere and no one dares to debate about it to them. we are still scared to speak out. thats a sign of our weakness. nuke deal wil leab us nowhere unless we start to assert ourselves on the right things., a: suhasini haidar: i do agree that us needs to be called out more on its actions in west asia, especially iraq, libya and syria. disagree that its our weakness that stops us though., q: how this improved india's proximity with usa will affect our equation with russia and china?, a: amit baruah: i think that maintaining good relations with all key powers and acting in our own national interest would make for a sound foreign policy., q: china already made their stand by calling pak a true friend..how russia responded to this...?, a: suhasini haidar: china wants a much deeper engagement with india too….all relations mustn't be seen as zero-sum, q: i am wondering at some political commentators observations that upa failed to seal this nuclear deal even before getting to know about the specifics involved. upa could have also made it, had they given up on liability clause. if modi govt has surrendered on this liability issue, then i dont think it is a major foreign policy achievement as seen by some excited fellows on tv debates., a: suhasini haidar: i agree with you…and i think we need to give the government time on making it clear exactly what they have given by way of assurances in order to take the deal forward, q: will the backing of us for a permanent seat in the security council mean anything, when we know that china will veto the proposal in the end anyways?, a: amit baruah: on the previous occasion, when india had a shot at entering the unsc, both china and the united states worked actively on african countries to ensure that entry did not happen!!, q: we are hearing that we will get seat in security council for last 10 years when they are going to decide or reform the council ?, a: suhasini haidar: un secy général has asked the unga spl committee to give its report, probably this year. lets see how much longer after that!, q: given president obama's remaining tenure is pretty much lame duck, how sustainable are the arrangements and understandings reached during this visit ?, a: narayan lakshman: good question. the arrangements will be sustainable if nothing because india enjoys bipartisan support here in the u.s. second, once a policy such as the nuclear deal has been operationalised, it is very hard for the u.s. to undo it, possibly involving protracted legal wrangling and negotiations in congress, something that the next occupant of the white house, whichever party they're from, will seek to avoid. also, it will upset new delhi!, q: will there be any bad impact on already stressed relations in the south asia because of this visit??, a: amit baruah: certainly, the pakistanis are far from pleased and unhappy at obama gracing india's military might on republic day. his presence is a big change for us policies., q: is usa concessions and also australia's willingness to help nuclear supply to india is deliberate as there are reports that world is moving out of nuclear energy to solar , wind energy which are more sustainable....is it like making india a market to dump nuclear ......., a: varghese k george: that is exaggerated fear. all over the world, new research is on to make nuclear technology cheaper, safer and abundant without compromising security aspects. so i guess, post hydrocarbon energy technology may be primarily nuclear., q: on the one hand, a foreigner (president obama) talks on the lines of how we must stand together in spite of our diverse religion and culture, implying that the hatred that most leaders groomed in religious outfits seem to have must let go of them and work for real progress of the country. while on the other hand, we seem to make an issue out of everything (the case of vp ansari criticised in spite of following the protocol). does the future hold any kind of ray of hope to see a 'secular' state?, a: amit baruah: there are disturbing signs on the horizon. it is for the government and its functionaries to take note of these and address them. india can only advance if all its citizens progress together and the country is at peace with itself and its many diversities., q: could india hope from us that it will stand firmly against the terrorism spread by the pakistan ? will they have a stand to fight against terrorism in india, a: amit baruah: the us has its own problems with pakistan. those two countries know each other well! they have been both partners and allies for long. and, now, the public mood in pakistan is distinctly anti-america., q: some us presidents hold meetings with visiting heads of states not in washington but in other places . why not goi also take visting heads to places like ooty , mount abu , shimla etc, a: varghese k george: well namo did try that with xi jinping. that is part of his declared changes that he wants to bring about in diplomacy, q: undoubtedly commerce , security and energy will be to be the top issues in the indo-us dialogue for many years to come. now that obama has yielded some ground on the nuclear deal front will the modi government promote fdi in retail in all the indian states in the context of make in india campaign ?, a: narayan lakshman: a couple of points here: first, it is not clear that the us has yielded any ground on the nuclear deal. see my story in >today's paper. second, i do not think fdi in retail will take a major hit owing to the make in india campaign, primarily because the former will also create lots of jobs in india, even if some profits get repatriated abroad. additionally the focus of the make in india campaign involves other areas, such as defence, the digital india plan and many more, so no reason why fdi retail will be impacted adversely., q: a statement remainding the fundamentalism and religious freedom is really needed to be given by a powerful leader like obama is very much the need of the hour. in our country many people of minorities are being persecuted every now and then....., a: suhasini haidar: i am not sure if president obama making those comments will have much effect in india. if he has issues on religious freedoms, he must bring them up in his bilateral talks, not a speech as he is leaving. it left a rather mixed signal from his visit., q: will obama's visit impact india's relations with russia , given that india has spoken against the russia-ukraine issue and do you foresee russia-china engagement?, a: amit baruah: i think india's closeness to the us is not new, but the russians like others will be marking the presence of obama at republic day, q: as china rightly pointed out, we shouldn’t believe in us. as they propagate false agenda for their own benefits. what does our government think?, a: varghese k george: oh well, we cannot trust china either. that is precisely the logic of ""strategic autonomy"" in india's foreign policy. while we maintain cordial relations

india-us bhai-bhai and china-india, a: suhasini haidar: i think pm modi has taken a very definitive stand on countering china over the past few months in relns with japan, australia, vietnam and the us. this is going to make our engagement with china, which is india's largest trading partner tricky. eam sushma swaraj is heading to beijing next week, pm modi will probably go later this year, so hopefully this will be managed., q: do you think obama visit had compelling motives like selling us goods here and get some support for china ? is yes .. are there any other major motive besides these

2015-02-23,president pranab mukherjee speech to the joint session of parliament,"president pranab mukherjee addresses the joint session of both houses of parliament at the beginning of the budget session in new delhi on monday. , address by the president of india, shri pranab mukherjee to the joint session of both houses of parliament, new delhi : 23.02.2015, honourable members,, 1. in this new year full of aspirations and hope, i welcome you to the joint sitting of the two houses of the parliament with the belief that your deliberations will be productive and useful., 2. dr. shyama prasad mukherjee had said, ""the greatest strength of india is her rich spiritual and civilizational heritage”.the core values of our civilization emphasize universal good - welfare of all human beings. the fundamental tenet of my government is sabka saath sabka vikas – all together, development of all. within a span of nine months, my government has articulated and embarked on a comprehensive strategy for unleashing the full potential of our country and its precious resource of 125 crore people. measures have been initiated to stir action in a range of fields from sanitation to smart cities, poverty elimination to creation of wealth, skill development to conquering space, tapping demographic dividend to diplomatic initiatives, enhancing ease of doing business to putting in place a stable policy framework, empowering individuals to ensuring quality infrastructure, ending financial untouchability to making the country a manufacturing hub, containing inflation to stimulating economy, igniting minds to ensuring inclusive growth, promoting cooperative federalism to encouraging a competitive spirit among the states. a strong beginning has been made. a promising future awaits us., honourable members,, 3. poverty is a bane to dignified human existence. development is actualized only when the last person gets a sense of fulfillment, especially, regarding his minimum needs. pandit deendayal upadhyaya had laid emphasis on holistic development of each and every human being - ekatm manavata darshan (integral humanism).my government is pledged to work for the welfare of the poor, the marginalized and the vulnerable sections of the society., 4. financial inclusion is critical to poverty elimination. my government launched an ambitious pradhan mantri jan dhan yojanato provide universal access to banking facilities – a bank account, having in-built accidental insurance with a rupay debit card. i am happy to state that the coverage under the scheme is close to 100% with a record 13.2 crore new bank accounts being opened, 11.5 crore rupay debit cards being issued and over ` 11,000 crore being deposited. this unprecedented target was achieved in less than six months, making it the largest such programme globally., 5. to ensure that the benefits of developmental programmes reach the last intended beneficiary without leakages and impediments, direct benefit transfer programme is being implemented with renewed vigour. the biggest direct cash transfer programme in the world, pahal, for transfer of lpg subsidy, has been extended across the country from 1stjanuary, 2015, so far covering 75% of the user-households. in all, 35 schemes have been brought under direct benefit transfer architecture. special emphasis is attached to make aadhar enrolment coverage universal., honourable members,, 6. swachhata is an article of faith for my government. swachhata will have an overarching impact on the overall quality of life and well-being of a person, particularly the poor. swachh bharat mission has been launched to achieve a clean and open defecation free india by october, 2019. government has rolled out ‘swachh vidyalaya’ programme and is committed to construct a toilet in every school before 15th august, 2015.swachhata has a cascading impact on national development and the potential to generate wealth from waste. sanitation and the idea of swachhata require changing the mindset of the people. my government exhorts each and every individual to be an active participant in this mission. i appeal to all honourable members of parliament to spend at least fifty percent of their mplads funds on swachh bharat mission., 7. india lives in her villages. my government attaches the highest priority to sustainable socio-economic growth of rural areas. mgnregs can be a powerful weapon to combat rural poverty. while implementing mgnregs with renewed vigour, emphasis is being placed on improving quality and durability of assets under the programme, besides mandating that at least sixty percent of expenditure be directed for creation of agricultural infrastructure. in keeping with my government’s focus on “skill india”, “deen dayal upadhyaya grameen kaushal yojana” and “deen dayal upadhyaya antyodaya yojana” have been announced. saansad adarsh gram yojana launched in october 2014, focuses on integrated and holistic development of our villages with active involvement of members of parliament., 8. housing is a fundamental requirement for dignified living. my government is steadfast in fulfilling the aspirations of all households, particularly the poorest of the poor, to have a dwelling unit under the mission “housing for all” by 2022, marking 75 years of our independence. a set of fiscal and non-fiscal incentives have been devised to leverage the value of land holding with government and to afford flexibility to state governments in designing their own customized housing programmes. to aid investment in housing sector, my government has liberalized fdi policy; increased tax incentives for housing loans and enhanced the corpus of national housing bank., 9. my government attaches paramount importance to safeguard the interest of farmers and families affected by land acquisition. while taking utmost care to protect the interest of farmers, including their compensation entitlements, the right to fair compensation and transparency in land acquisition, rehabilitation and resettlement act has been suitably refined to minimize certain procedural difficulties in acquisition of land inevitably required for critical public projects of infrastructure and for creation of basic amenities like rural housing, schools and hospitals, particularly in remote areas., honourable members,, 10. kisanis the sentinel of our food security. annadaata sukhibhava has been one of our fundamental civilizational values. my government attaches enormous importance to the wellbeing of farmers. this will need value-added agriculture, market reform, use of technology and improving productivity in areas with untapped potential. the year 2015 has been designated as international year of soils. in view of the critical role of soil for productivity and farm output, a soil health card scheme has been launched. price stabilization fund with a corpus of ` 500 crore has been set up for perishable commodities. to address the irrigation requirements of every village in an effective and sustainable manner, pradhan mantri krishi sinchai yojana, is being launched. extension programmes have been devised targeting resource-poor, small and marginal farmers, particularly focusing on organic farming and green house technology. rashtriya gokul mission has been launched with the objective of conserving and developing indigenous cattle breeds., 11. food processing has immense potential for generating employment in rural areas, particularly for the landless poor, besides guaranteeing remunerative price for the farm-produce. creating infrastructure in rural areas to minimize supply chain losses is a priority. a special fund of ` 2000 crore to provide affordable credit to the units in 72 notified food parks has been made operational. two mega food parks, at tumkur and fazilka, each to provide direct/indirect employment to 30,000 people have been commissioned in the last 6 months., 12. former prime minister shri atal bihari vajpayee had said and i quote: ""poverty has multiple effects. besides impacting our economy, it corrodes our democracy”. inclusive growth covering the poorest of poor from the most vulnerable and disadvantaged sections of our society is my government’s topmost priority. thrust has been given to streamlining scholarships schemes for students from sc, st, obc, and minority communities to ensure timely disbursement to the beneficiaries. government has set up a new venture capital fund for sc entrepreneurs. to upgrade skill and training in traditional arts/crafts of minorities, a new scheme “upgrading the skill and training in traditional arts/crafts for development (usttad)” is being launched. outcome based

talent amongst children in the age group of 8 to 12 through national sports development fund and target olympic podium., 14. india has the largest population of youth in the world. majority of her population is already in the working age group. to tap this demographic dividend and to bridge the demand-supply gap in skilled workforce, my government has created a new ministry of skill development and entrepreneurship with the theme “hunar hai to kalyan hai”. a new “national policy for skill development and entrepreneurship” is on the anvil to align skilling initiatives with global standards. focus will be on the youth from deprived households in rural areas. public-private partnership is being fostered to create skill development models and channelize csr funds into skilling activities.,

schemes for students with disabilities. a national help line with toll free number has been launched for those who need help against drug de-addiction and for rehabilitation., 16. my government has

facilitate availability of quality ayush drugs., honourable members,, 17. women have had a place of reverence in our society since time immemorial. my government has taken several measures to empower and protect the dignity of women. to provide complete support to women affected by violence, one stop crisis centres, one in every state, are being set up for provision of integrated services including medical aid, police assistance, temporary shelter, and legal and psycho-social counseling. another initiative has been the launch of himmat, a mobile based application, to ensure women’s safety in delhi., 18. the unabated decline in child sex ratio since 1961 is a matter of grave concern. this trend has to be reversed. to ensure survival, protection and education of the girl child, my government has launched beti bachao, beti padhao abhiyaan, which seeks to change mindsets to celebrate the girl child. a new small saving scheme‘sukanya samriddhi account’ has been notified for enabling the education of the girl child. a bill to amend juvenile justice act has been introduced in parliament to reform the law relating to juvenile offences., honourable members,, 19. shramik is the backbone of our economy. my government believes in shrameve jayate and has taken several labour welfare measures. apprentice protsahan yojana has been launched to promote apprentices in micro, small and medium enterprises in manufacturing sector. epf subscriptions have been made portable benefiting casual workers in the unorganized sector. under the employees provident fund act, the statutory wage ceiling and the minimum pension have been enhanced to ` 15,000/- and ` 1,000/- respectively. while my government is fully committed to expand the job market and to promote the welfare of workers, it is also committed to bringing in transparency and accountability in enforcement of labour-related regulations. to this end, the shram suvidha portalhas been launched to ensure ease of doing business by allowing industry to register online and file a single online return instead of 16 separate returns. a transparent online inspection scheme has been launched. recent amendments to the apprentices act, 1961 have made the legal framework friendly to both industry and employable youth., honourable members,, 20. legal reform is one of the priorities of my government., my government believes that governance and reforms are a combined effort of team india, consisting of the parliament, union government, state legislatures, state governments and the people of india. an example of this collaborative effort is the reform in the process of appointment of judges to the high courts and supreme court and the legislation to set up national judicial appointments commission. the government is also committed to repeal the obsolete and redundant laws. a committee constituted for this purpose has identified 1741 central acts for repeal under various categories., 21. maximum governance minimum government is the guiding principle of my government. with an aim to take governance to the doorstep of the poorest of the poor in remotest areas, focus is on simplification of official procedures and reducing the decision-making levels in government by leveraging technology. the system of group of ministers has been dispensed with and emphasis is on swift decision-making. while introducing stricter and sterner measures to deal with corruption; effort is being made to ensure that sufficient safeguards are in place to protect bona fide decisions taken in public interest and to inspire confidence in the civil service., 22. my government is firmly committed to engage people in the process of governance and policy-making. my gov online platform, a path breaking initiative, has been launched. this platform has ensured public participation in decision-making and ideation of various national flagship programmes like swachh bharat mission, namami gange, pradhan mantri jan dhan yojana and niti aayog., 23. my government has envisioned an ambitious umbrella programme, digital india, to prepare india for technology based transformation and citizen centric transparent governance with service orientation. aadhar based attendance system and jeevan praman, aadhar based digital life certificate portal, have shown that innovative use of technology can make enormous difference. measures are being taken to accomplish digital inclusion in rural areas, small towns, north-east and other remote areas, opening up immense job opportunities in these areas. promoting manufacturing of electronic goods has been an area of thrust., 24. my government is pledged to decentralization of power and as an important step in this direction, the planning commission has been replaced with a new body-the national institution for transforming india -niti aayog. the underlying spirit of niti aayog is to foster the spirit of cooperative federalism so that union and state governments come on a platform to forge a common national agenda for development, with thrust on empowering the impoverished., honourable members,, 25. as a result of my government’s sustained efforts and series of policy initiatives, our economy is again on the high growth trajectory. according to the latest estimates, our gdp is growing at 7.4%, which makes india the fastest growing large economy in the world. inflation and food inflation, in particular, are at a record low due to a number of decisive measures taken by the government. fixed capital formation, which faced a near stagnation in the last few years, has increased. capital markets are upbeat. our external sector is now far more resilient, particularly with a moderate current account deficit and a broadly stable rupee. our foreign exchange reserves have been substantially augmented., 26. while my government has intensified efforts to bring greater efficiency and equity into the tax system, prudence in expenditure management is also high on the agenda of my government. a constitutional (amendment) bill has been introduced to bring in goods and services tax that will simplify the indirect tax regime, broaden the tax base and result in better tax compliance., honourable members,, 27. my government is committed to taking all possible measures to stop generation of black money, both domestically and internationally. these measures include putting in place robust legislative and administrative frameworks, systems and process with due focus on capacity building, integration of information through technology, and fast tracking prosecution., 28. financial sector institutional restructuring is a priority area. my government will expedite implementation of the recommendations of the financial sector legislative reforms commission. sebi’s new foreign portfolio investment regulations have established a unified, simple regulatory framework. the insurance laws (amendment) ordinance, 2014 was promulgated enhancing the foreign equity cap from 26% to 49% while safeguarding indian ownership and control. this will enhance capital availability and ensure better access to insurance services, especially in rural areas and for economically weaker sections. small banks and payments banks are being permitted to expand the reach of the banking system., honourable members,, 29. my government has taken major initiatives for improving ‘ease of doing business’ through simplification and rationalization of existing rules and procedures. leveraging it and use of modern technologies is a key strategy. single window in a hub - spoke model is being made a reality. applying for industrial license and industrial entrepreneur memorandum can now be done online on 24x7 basis on the ebiz website. a number of entry and exit regulations have been eased out., 30. my government has launched the ""make in india” programme which aims to create a wholesome eco-system to transform india into a manufacturing hub. fdi in railways has been opened up selectively to bring in much needed capital, state-of-the-art technology and global best practices. fdi in defence has been increased to 49% subject to certain conditions. fdi norms in construction & development sector have been relaxed. continuous evaluation of inverted duties is being undertaken to make indian industries competitive. stress is being laid on research and innovation. while focusing our attention on manufacturing for creating more jobs, my government will continue to work on our formidable strength in the service sector., honourable members,, 31. my government is committed to realizing the true potential of entrepreneurs of india by nurturing the msme sector. 21 msme clusters are being supported by providing soft skills and common facilities through 965 interventions. khadi and village industries and traditional industries clusters are initiated in border, hill and poverty-stricken areas of the country. focus is on technology upgradation, better financial access and market linkages to msme units., 32. textiles sector is the second largest employer after agriculture, providing direct employment to over 4.5 crore people. the sector also contributes one seventh of industrial production and brings more than one fourth of country’s foreign exchange inflows. the growth and all round development of this sector has a direct bearing on the improvement of our economy, particularly the poor artisans. recent initiatives like setting up of trade facilitation centres in different parts of india, bringing textile marketing on-line, incentives for technical textiles, promotion of pashmina, special focus on increasing the coverage in north-eastern part of the country would lead to advancement of

development and reviving economic growth. indian railways are the arteries of our economy. my government is committed to reform and infuse new vitality into this sector through better services,

a prudent policy in national interest. the ethanol policy has been revised to promote use of ethanol in petrol and help sugarcane farmers., 40. my government is committed to optimum utilization and transparency in allocation of natural resources. the process for auction of coal blocks has been started in a manner which will reduce the power costs in the country, provide adequate fuel to increase power generation, enhance production of steel, cement, aluminium and other essential materials. this will also provide huge resources from allotment of mines to the mineral and coal bearing states particularly in eastern areas for accelerated development of the region. the swift and timely action taken by my government in this regard prevented the closure of mines which otherwise would have rendered thousands jobless. in coming years, my government would make focussed efforts to expand exploration capacity and to increase domestic coal production to 1000 mtpa., honourable members,, 41.

paramilitary forces for the outstanding service rendered during the relief operations to flood affected people in jammu & kashmir., 47. a high state of disaster preparedness is the key to contain loss

odisha together with the central government., 48. my government is committed to implement the idea of smart police (smart but sensitive, modern and mobile, alert and accountable, reliable and

companies. as the current indian government pushes for initiatives such as ‘make in india’ and ‘digital india,’ it cannot help but rely on raw materials provided by innovators who have fuelled the ‘sharing economy’ since the turn of the century., the myth that “innovation” occurs with ideas from a few entities — which was convenient for some highly concentrated global industries at the end of the 20th century — has exploded in the 21st century. wikipedia is the starting point for almost every act of learning. no proprietary software company, not even microsoft, can resist the changes in the software industry brought about by free software, also known as open source software or free and open-source software., music, photography and other creative arts have been made more accessible, both to audiences and to new creators, by the creative commons licensing approach which allows unlimited or near-unlimited sharing of creative works, turning audiences into distributors. open access scientific journals are spreading the benefits of scientific scholarship to those who cannot afford subscriptions to expensive traditional journals. for instance, initiatives like the mit open courseware have made the finest curricula in world higher education available to teachers and students, free of charge. massive collaboration among individuals, sometimes known as peer production — which not only occurs without ownership of ideas but cannot occur in the presence of over-burdensome strong iprs — has changed human society forever., this sharing economy, based not on ownership but rather on free collaboration in the digital net, is now inextricably intertwined with the legacy ownership-based economy which depends on it for growth. mobile communications, cloud computing, big data, and fast cheap genetic sequencing — indeed all the current sources of massive technical progress in human society — depend in crucial part on outputs like free and open source software, from the sharing economy. fostering national innovation may occasionally involve payoffs to foreign rent-seekers (the indian patent system is overwhelmingly exploited not by indian companies, but by foreign “owners” seeking to tax indian economic growth through extraction of royalty payments), but the core of any national policy must be freedom to invent, which in a developing society can only be provided by sharing rather than owning., the principle of freedom to invent not just implies that legal institutions should respect sharing to the same extent as owning, but also social structures — in the educational system, government action, and cultural norm-creation — that foster inventiveness in the population. “yankee ingenuity,” the technological flowering that made one part of the u.s. the workshop of the world in the early 19th century, was the outcome of economic realities, social policies and cultural practices much more than legal rules. so a national innovation policy means teaching students from the beginning of primary school that no one can own an idea., it means helping farmers share seeds and ideas to improve the effectiveness of agriculture. it means enabling creation by everyone, not limiting creation to those who can afford patent licenses. it means recognising and rewarding those who devote their creativity to humanity, like jonas salk who refused to patent his polio vaccine so that the world, rich and poor, could be healed alike.",0.12973047785547787,instituting freedom share,"innovation policy human race national intellectual property rights (

2015-04-11,text of narendra modi’s address to unesco,"director general, madam bokova,, excellencies, ladies and gentlemen,, i am truly honoured to address unesco., i feel specially privileged to visit this great institution in its 70th anniversary year., this milestone reminds us of a fundamental achievement of our age: for the first time in human history, we have an organization for the entire world – the united nations., and, through the sweeping change of these decades, through many challenges of our times, and the great progress of this era, the organization has endured and grown., there have been doubts and skepticism. there is need for urgent reforms., but, for the nations that came together at its birth; and, for three times as many that joined it later, there is one unshakeable belief:, “our world is and will remain a better place because of the united nations.”, it is this faith that has given birth to so many of its institutions that deal with every aspect of human challenges., our collective goal is to seek a peaceful and prosperous future for our world, in which every nation has a voice;, all people have an identity;, all cultures are flowers in a garden;, every human being has a life of dignity;, every child a future of opportunity;, and our planet the chance to preserve its glory., no organization serves our cause more than this one., the seeds of our collective destiny are sown in human minds., it is nurtured by the light of education and the spirit of enquiry., it makes progress through the marvels of science., and, it draws strength from the basic character of nature – the harmony and unity in diversity., that is why unesco was among the first missions of the united nations., that is why india values the work of unesco so deeply; and, cherishes our partnership so immensely., i am conscious of the extraordinary legacy of our relationship from the time of unesco’s birth., i recall mahatma gandhi’s message to unesco, calling for urgent action to address the needs of education to secure lasting peace;, and, the leadership of dr. radhakrishnan, later our first president, in the early years of this institution., we are grateful for unesco’s support for education and science, in india and for preservation of our cultural heritage., equally, we are privileged to have worked with unesco in support of its mission around the world., for, in the challenges india faces and the dreams that indians seek, our approach mirrors the ideals of unesco., we have built a modern state in an ancient land, with a timeless tradition of openness and co-existence; and, a society of extraordinary diversity., the foundation of our constitution rests on a fundamental principle: the peace and prosperity of all is indivisible from the welfare of the individual;, the strength of the nation is determined by the joined hands of every citizen;, and, real progress is measured through empowerment of the weakest., this has been our creed since we assumed office nearly a year ago., and, we shall judge our progress not just by the cold statistics of growth, but by the warm glow of belief and hope on human faces., for me, it means many things., we will defend and protect the rights and liberty of every citizen., we will ensure that every citizen , of every faith, culture and creed has an equal place in our society; belief in her future; and the confidence to pursue it., education always had a special place in our tradition., as our ancient saying goes, it is, व्यये कृते वर्धते एव नित्यं, विद्या धनं सर्व प्रधानं।, the wealth that increases by giving,, that wealth is knowledge, and is supreme of all possessions, we have launched the most ambitious programme to provide skills to our youth; and education for every child in the remotest villages., our progress will remain a mirage unless women no longer suffer from daily fear, or barriers to opportunity; and, when they are no longer victims of exclusion and prejudice. and, this change must begin with the girl child., so, the programme to educate and support the girl child in india is one that is closest to my heart. we will ensure that they can go to school; and, also, that they can attend it in safety and dignity., today, the digital age has created opportunities beyond imagination; but, digital divide can expand disparities., on the other hand, digital connectivity and smart phones have create a revolution of possibilities to educate, deliver services and extend development., this is the most exciting change in our era., our digital india will create a participative, transparent and a responsive government, connected to the citizens. and, we have launched a digital literacy mission to connect each of our 600,000 villages., the link between habitat and fulfillment of human potential is deep and strong., so, the highest priority for my government is to provide a roof over every head; power in every house; sanitation and clean water within everyone’s reach; a hope for every child to survive; and a chance for every new mother to love her child., it also means clean rivers, air that we can breathe and forests filled with the sound of birds., to achieve these goals, we need not just policies and resources, but even more the power of science., for us, science is driven by the larger purpose of human development; and, for a safe, sustainable, prosperous future for india., science also unites people across borders in a shared purpose., and, when we share its fruits with those who don’t have it, we connect lives and make our world a better place., india never forgets the help we have received in our early years; today, we are fulfilling our responsibility to others., therefore, science is a key priority of india’s international engagement., culture is a sublime expression of a people; and, the foundations of a society., unesco’s initiatives to preserve the world’s cultural heritage, including in india, are inspiring., we see india’s rich and diverse cultural heritage as humanity’s wealth., and, we will do everything to preserve it for future generations., we have launched ‘heritage development and augmentation yojana – hriday or heart in hindi – to preserve the cultural heritage of our cities., we have started a special scheme called “prasad”, or offerings – “pilgrimage rejuvenation and spirituality augmentation drive” – for rejuvenation of our pilgrim centres., madam chairman,, i speak of our vision and initiatives, because in our own aspirations and efforts, we see the value of unesco to our world with great clarity., in the challenges of our times, we see its purpose with a sense of urgency., the fault lines in our world are shifting from the boundaries of nations into the web of our societies and the streets of our cities., the threats are changing from domination by states to destruction by groups., we fight today not only over what we claim, but also for who we are., and, in many parts of the world, culture remains a source of conflict., we have access to communication at the click of a mouse., we live in a world of information., yet, we know that familiarity does not always lead to fraternity; or reduce prejudice., when ebola threatens an entire region; the fury of unseasonal storms destroys crops and lives; and, diseases still defeat our most courageous fight, we understand how fragile we are., when we see people living at the edge of existence; children shut out of classrooms; and, nations without the human resources to shoulder the responsibility of progress, we know that we still have a long way to go., to be sure, our world has made incredible progress over seven decades. so, our progress should inspire us to meet our challenges., unesco can play a vital role in addressing them., culture must connect, not divide, our world., it should be a bridge to greater respect and understanding between people., it should join nations in peace and harmony. across india’s neighbourhood, asia and indian ocean, we are retracing our cultural connections to form a closer bond of friendship in this dynamic region., we must turn deep into our cultures; traditions; and religions; to overcome the rising tide of extremism, violence, and divisions across the world., we must intensify exchanges between the youth of the world to sow the seeds of a more peaceful world., cultures also hold great wealth of traditional knowledge. societies across the world have evolved them through wisdom gathered over the ages., and, they hold the secrets to economic, efficient, and, environment friendly solutions to many of our problems., but, today they are at risk of extinction in our globalised world., so, we must here make more efforts to revive, preserve and nurture traditional knowledge., this will also redefine a fundamental truth about human civilization: as our cultures are diverse, knowledge has many sources., in doing so, we will give ourselves a greater chance to meet our challenges., we must do more to harness science for human welfare in some of the most vulnerable parts of the world – especially for health and food security., climate change is a pressing global challenge. and, it calls for a collective human action; and, a comprehensive response., we must draw upon our entire wealth of wisdom; the strength of every institution; all possibilities of innovation; and, the power of science., in india, faith and nature have had a deep link since ancient times., for us, the only path to prosperity is the sustainable one., we make this choice with the natural instincts of our culture and tradition. but, we also do this with a commitment to our future., we have, for example, set a target of adding 175,000 mw of clean and renewable energy in the next seven years., too often, our discussion is reduced to an argument about emission cuts. but, we are more likely to succeed if we offer affordable solutions, not simply impose choices., that is why i have called for global public action to develop clean energy, that is affordable and accessible to all., and, it is for the same reason that i call for a change in lifestyle. because, the emission reduction that we seek will be the natural outcome of how we live., and, it will also mean a different path to economic well being., it is with this vision that i had called the united nations general assembly last september to declare june 21st as the international day of yoga., yoga awakens a sense of oneness and harmony with self, society and nature. by changing our lifestyle and creating consciousness, it can help us deal with climate change and create a more balanced world., last december, the unga adopted it with a record co-sponsorship in a record time., it was not just an act of friendship for india. it reflected our collective ability to go beyond our familiar boundaries in search for solutions to common challenges., the campaign to clean our ganges river is a mission that connects culture, science, traditional knowledge, education, economy, and, environment; but, it is also about attitudes and lifestyles., madam chairperson,, outside this hall, i paid respect at the statue of a great indian philosopher and sage, shri aurobindo., there is much that we can learn from his humanism and spiritualism, from his belief in the unity of individual consciousness with the world outside; the enlightened purpose of education; the service of science; and, the unity of world, founded on national freedom, diversity of civilizations and autonomy of culture., it is a guiding spirit for the purpose of this institution – the defence of peace in the mind of men., the 70th anniversary is a moment to celebrate our remarkable journey so far. it is also a time to look ahead with wisdom that has come with time and experience.",0.19107999068442116,text narendra modi ’ address unesco,"director general , madam bokova ,, excellencies , ladies gentlemen ,, truly honoured address unesco. , feel specially privileged visit great institution 70th anniversary year. , milestone reminds us fundamental achievement age : first time human history , organization entire world – united nations. , , sweeping change decades , many challenges times , great progress era , organization endured grown. , doubts skepticism. need urgent reforms. , , nations came together birth ;

2015-04-19,coai calls for a debate on net neutrality,"the cellular operators association of india (coai), whose members have been at the receiving end of the net neutrality campaign, on sunday called for a debate on the issue from an indian perspective., “the association urges all stakeholders to have a comprehensive and informed debate on the subject of net neutrality keeping in mind the requirements of india and its citizens,” a statement said. a subject as important and complex as net neutrality should “not be left to the opinion of a few.”, net neutrality is the principle that internet service providers should treat all data on the internet equally, and not discriminate or charge differently by user, content, site, platform or application., “we support open internet and believe that consumers should decide what to do online. our job is to enable consumers to benefit from that freedom. we offer choice and do not block or provide any preferential access to any website or app,” the statement said., the association has said while its members are committed to investing in the government’s digital india vision, there is a need to create an enabling and equal environment that promotes the growth of the entire internet ecosystem., “without infrastructure and investment, there will be no internet access. the operators have invested billions of dollars in licence fees, spectrum fees and network roll-outs. yet the industry still makes negative return on the capital employed,” it argued., the industry estimates that the country will need an additional capital outlay of rs. 3,00,000 crore to 5,00,000 crore over the next 10 years in spectrum, new technology, equipment, towers and optical fibre backbone. “the need of the hour is to have a sustainable industry that has the ability to invest in growth of data services and connectivity to all,” the statement said. it also called for same rules for same services, including mobile and voip services., here is all you need to know about net neutrality, the internet is now a level-playing field. anybody can start up a website, stream music or use social media with the same amount of data that they have purchased with a particular isp. but in the absence of neutrality, your isp might favour certain websites over others for which you might have to pay extra. website a might load at a faster speed than website b because your isp has a deal with website a that website b cannot afford. it’s like your electricity company charging you extra for using the washing machine, television and microwave oven above and beyond what you are already paying., late last month, trai released a draft consultation paper seeking views from the industry and the general public on the need for regulations for over-the-top (ott) players such as whatsapp, skype, viber etc, security concerns and net neutrality. the objective of this consultation paper, the regulator said, was to analyse the implications of the growth of otts and consider whether or not changes were required in the current regulatory framework., ott or over-the-top refers to applications and services which are accessible over the internet and ride on operators&apos;

2015-07-18,address gender divide,"technology is not gender-neutral. photo: n. bhaskaran , when i first came to mumbai in my teens, the object of envy of all my aunt’s neighbours was a black instrument: a telephone. only those with “influence” got one. and the fact of the telephone suggested that my aunt was a person with “influence”., in the middle-class neighbourhood where she lived, ownership of the telephone made her immensely popular. because that black instrument was not just hers; it was communal property. when it rang, there was a buzz of excitement. from her balcony, people would be summoned to receive calls. others would knock on the door when they wanted to make a call. through the day, there was a steady stream of people making their way to and from that instrument., today, everyone has a phone, or almost everyone. ownership and use of mobile phones in india has gone exponentially. an estimated two-thirds of the population now has access to this technology. but do we pause to think about the remaining one-third, some 300 million people? who are they? it should not come as a surprise to us, living as we do in a gender-unequal society, that the majority of those who do not own a mobile phone, and don’t even have access to one, are women., a recent study by the gsma (groupe speciale mobile association), formed in 1995 by mobile operators worldwide, found that 1.7 billion women in poor and middle-income countries do not own a mobile phone. on an average, women were 14 per cent less likely to own a mobile phone than men, and in india that figure stood at 31 per cent. the report points out, “social norms and disparities between men and women in terms of education and income influence men’s access to and use of mobile technology, and often contribute to women experiencing barriers to mobile phone ownership and use more acutely than men.”, simply put, what this means is that even if you put a mobile phone in the hands of every single woman in this country, there is no guarantee that she will be free to use it as she wants, or even if she will know how to use it. her inherent disadvantage of being born a woman in this society works against that. she may not know how to read numbers, or letters. hence how will she manage a phone?, and if indeed she is unlettered, as are a little under half the women in india, is there any chance that the men in her family will allow her to handle a phone, or help her to learn how to use it? understanding this is essential as we continue our love affair with technology in this country with visions of a digital india and “smart” everything. technology is not gender-neutral. it cannot erase the disadvantages that are embedded in our societies. in some ways, it can even exacerbate them. to make such new technologies work for everyone, we have to recognise the gender divide and find ways to address it., to further illustrate this divide, here are some findings from a 2012 study by the grameen foundation titled “women, mobile phones and savings”. the study was assessing whether and if mobile phones were effective in encouraging women to participate in savings groups. the researchers found that even when women owned phones, they often did not know how to use them. they had to rely on their husbands or other members of the family to even make a call., another interesting fact that emerged was that 74 per cent of the married women in the group surveyed said that their husbands would not allow them to own a mobile phone. in fact, a good number of the women said that they preferred to deal with their savings without having to use the mobile phone., these studies emphasise that the current obsession with advancing new technologies in india must be tempered with the reality of gender, as well as other social factors. otherwise, those with access will build on their advantage, and those without will be left even further behind.",0.099877932145374,address gender divide,"technology gender-neutral. photo : n. bhaskaran , first came mumbai teens , object envy aunt ’ neighbours black instrument : telephone. “influence ” got one. fact telephone suggested aunt person “influence ” . , middle-class neighbourhood lived , ownership telephone made immensely popular. black instrument ; communal property. rang , buzz excitement. balcony , people would summoned receive calls. others would knock door wanted make call. day , steady stream people making way instrument. , today , everyone phone , almost everyone. ownership use mobile phones india gone exponentially. estimated two-thirds population access technology. pause think remaining one-third , 300 million people ?

2015-09-23,modi’s unrealistic american dreams,"there is at least one dimension in which the distance between narendra modi and jawaharlal nehru is not so great after all. i speak not of their fondness for the bandgala but of their >penchant for world travel. not a day passes without us being informed of some impending visit by our prime minister. right now, we are being bombarded with the details of the itinerary of his visit to the u.s. later this month. he will start, we’re told, with the annual meeting of the u.n. general assembly and from there proceed to the west coast., nehru had undertaken this journey too, in 1949. however, we were a different country then, having inherited a bloodily-partitioned nation with a declining per capita income. on the other hand, india is today one of the world’s fastest-growing economies, hoarding a young labour stock and a substantial talent pool, making the task of its leadership a little easier by comparison., while india must constantly engage with the rest of the world at all levels, the rest of the world does not hold the key to either the pace or inclusiveness of its economic growth. it is, therefore, altogether surprising that the leader of india should travel westward urging “come make in india.”, india’s unique place in world order india is made to appear as a supplicant when no one asks it to be one. nehru himself had travelled the world as the torchbearer both of an ancient civilisation and a cosmopolitan internationalism with roots in the west to which he considered himself a natural heir. till the 1990s, many an indian abroad would have been the beneficiary of praise from african students and american workers for india’s role in hastening the process of decolonisation. it is not without significance that india had been the first port of call for nelson mandela after the end of apartheid in south africa., before it comes to be imagined that nehru’s forays into the wider world had amounted only to showcasing indian attire, we may want to remember that extraordinary financial inflows had been elicited then. non-alignment brought with it an unexpected reward as the rival ideological blocks vied with one another to shower india with aid. over a quarter of the total financing for the second five-year plan was via official aid from the rest of the world. michal kalecki, the astute polish economist who was one among many intellectuals who had made a beeline for this quickening country, had remarked pithily that india’s policy of non-alignment was akin to “a clever calf sucking milk from two cows!”, it is also of interest that nehru had shown no particular anxiety over wanting india as a permanent member of the u.n. security council, even as he thanklessly championed communist china’s claims. it is not known what exactly he had thought of the prize itself, but it could not have escaped his attention that even when it was not a cabal of the rich and powerful it could hardly count as a democratic arrangement. contrast this with india’s desperate attempts today to gain membership of this discredited club. but of course the world has changed since the fifties. apartheid and colonialism have vanished, and china is firmly entrenched in the security council, and one might say with nary a thought for india’s inclusion., so, one should not expect >mr. modi to travel to the u.s. with an anachronistic agenda. yet, one may expect him to be clear of what it will yield in relation to india’s current priorities. an argument is usually made out in terms of attracting foreign direct investment (fdi) and, possibly, technology to drive the ‘digital india’ programme., it is incontestable that both foreign investment and the spread of information and communications technology are very important for india. in fact, every effort must be made to accelerate their adoption. however, on fdi, much of what can be achieved via enabling legislation has been achieved. further, the tariff barrier to trade has been rescinded along with quantitative controls., foreign trade accounts for more than 50 per cent of the indian economy by now. however, the promised gains in manufacturing are disappointing, suggesting that domestic supply and demand conditions may be at least as important for indian manufacturing as is an open trade regime. it is indeed correct that fdi has increased exponentially over the past one year, suggesting to some that this reflects a new international confidence in india’s economy. while the figure is impressive it is not unprecedented. in any case, fdi accounts for less than 10 per cent of total capital formation in the country. as for the it tsars mr. modi is to meet in silicon valley, the u.s.-based it industry, with its significant indian presence, has long ago sensed the profit opportunity in engaging with india and does not need handholding. so it is likely to bide its time., altogether, while the government is right to pursue foreign investment and technology, it does give the impression of not giving as much importance to other areas. without suggesting what these areas are, we might suggest that soon as the pm returns from abroad he goes on a virtual bharat darshan. he could even remain in the pmo while travelling backwards in a time-machine. what would be the things that he will get to see?, domestic issues, imported solutions he will find a farmer committing suicide in hyderabad because he couldn’t afford medical care for his son. he will find that in bihar, to which state he has promised an out-of-turn special assistance of rs. 1.25 lakh crore, the overwhelming majority of rural households do not have access to sanitation. in delhi, he will find a doctor of the all india institute of medical sciences (aiims) announce on television that dengue is “endemic” to its population, a grave diagnosis indeed. in rajasthan, a state run by his own party, he would find that a senior civil servant ran an extortion racket yielding four crores in ready rupees, thus taking the meaning of “ease of doing business” to an altogether new level. so, alighting from the time machine, he is likely to be struck by the thought that while ‘digital india’ is a worthwhile project per se, it can only be a partial answer to what needs to be done in this vast and yet underdeveloped country.",0.09593807977736553,modi ’ unrealistic american dreams,"least one dimension distance narendra modi jawaharlal nehru great all. speak fondness bandgala >penchant world travel. day passes

2015-09-27,full text of narendra modi's speech at san jose,"thank you, shantanu, john, satya, paul, sunder, and venkatesh, a big thank you!, i am sure this was not pre-arranged. but, here on stage you see a perfect picture of india-u.s. partnership in the digital economy., good evening, everyone!, if there was ever a gathering under one roof that could claim to be shaping the world, it is this. and, i am not talking about those in public office, here or in india! it’s a great pleasure to be here in california. it is one of the last places in the world to see the sun set. but, it is here that new ideas see the first light of the day., it’s a great honour that you have joined us tonight. i have met many of you in delhi and new york, and on facebook, twitter and instagram., these are the new neighborhoods of our new world. if facebook were a country, it would be the third most populous one and the most connected., google today has made teachers less awe-inspiring and grandparents more idle. twitter has turned everyone into a reporter. the traffic lights that need to work the best are on cisco routers., the status that now matters is not whether you are awake or asleep, but whether you are online or offline. the most fundamental debate for our youth is the choice between android, ios or windows., from computing to communication, entertainment to education, from printing documents to printing products, and, now to internet of things, it’s been a long journey in a short time., from cleaner energy to better healthcare and safer transport, everything is converging around the work you do., in africa, it’s helping people transfer money on phone. it has made reaching small island states no longer a journey of adventure, but a convenient click of a mouse., in india, a mother in a distant hill village has a better chance to save her new born infant. a child in a remote village has better access to education., a small farmer is more confident about his land holding and getting better market price. a fisherman on the sea has a better catch. and, a young professional in san francisco can skype daily to comfort her sick grandmother in india., an initiative by a father in haryana for “selfie with daughter” to draw attention to the girl child became an international movement., all this is because of the work you people are doing. since my government came to office last year, we have attacked poverty by using the power of networks and mobile phones to launch a new era of empowerment and inclusion: 180 million new bank accounts in a few months; direct transfer of benefits to the poor; funds for the unbanked; insurance within the reach of the poorest; and, pension for the sunset years for all., by using space technology and internet, we have been able to identify in the last few months 170 applications that will make governance better and development faster., when a small craftsman in a village in india brings a smile to a customer looking at his phone on a metro ride in new york; when a heart patient in a remote hospital in kyrgyz republic is treated by doctors sitting in delhi, as i saw in bishkek, we know we are creating something that has fundamentally changed our lives., the pace at which people are taking to digital technology defies our stereotypes of age, education, language and income. i like recounting my meeting with a group of unlettered tribal women in a remote part of gujarat. they were present at a local milk chilling plant i was inaugurating. they were using cell phones to take photographs of the event. i asked them what they would do with the images. the answer was a surprise for me., they said, they would go back, have the images downloaded on to a computer and take printouts. yes, they were familiar with the language of our digital world., and, farmers in maharashtra state have created a whatsapp group to share information on farming practices., customers, more than creators, are defining the use of a product. the world may be driven by the same ancient impulses. we will continue to see human struggles and successes. we will witness human glory and tragedies., but, in this digital age, we have an opportunity to transform lives of people in ways that was hard to imagine just a couple of decades ago., this is what sets us apart from the century that we have just left behind. there may be still some who see the digital economy as the tool of the rich, educated and the privileged. but, ask the taxi driver or the corner vendor in india what he has gained from his cell phone, and the debate gets settled. i see technology as a means to empower and as a tool that bridges the distance between hope and opportunity. social media is reducing social barriers. it connects people on the strength of human values, not identities., today, technology is advancing citizen empowerment and democracy that once drew their strength from constitutions. technology is forcing governments to deal with massive volume of data and generate responses, not in 24 hours but in 24 minutes., when you think of the exponential speed and scale of expansion of social media or a service, you have to believe that it is equally possible to rapidly transform the lives of those who have long stood on the margins of hope. so, friends out of this conviction was born the vision of digital india., it is an enterprise for india’s transformation on a scale that is, perhaps, unmatched in human history. not just to touch the lives of the weakest, farthest and the poorest citizen of india, but change the way our nation will live and work., for nothing else will do in a country with 800 million youth under the age of 35 years, impatient for change and eager to achieve it., we will transform governance, making it more transparent, accountable, accessible and participative. i spoke of e-governance as a foundation of better governance – efficient, economical and effective., i now speak of m-governance or mobile governance. that is the way to go in a country with one billion cell phones and use of smart phones growing at high double digit rates. it has the potential to make development a truly inclusive and comprehensive mass movement. it puts governance within everyone’s reach., after mygov.in, i have just launched the narendra modi mobile app. they are helping me stay in close touch with people. i learn a great deal from their suggestions and complaints., we want to free our citizens from the burden of excessive paper documents in every office. we want paperless transactions. we will set up a digital locker for every citizen to store personal documents that can be shared across departments., we have set up ebiz portal to make approvals for businesses and citizens easy and efficient so that they concentrate their energy on their goals, not on government processes., we are using technology to impart scale and speed to development., information, education, skills, healthcare, livelihood, financial inclusion, small and village enterprises, opportunities for women, conservation of natural resources, distributed clean energy – entirely new possibilities have emerged to change the development model., but for all this, we must bridge the digital divide and promote digital literacy in the same way that we seek to ensure general literacy., we must ensure that technology is accessible, affordable, and adds value., we want our 1.25 billion citizens to be digitally connected. we already have broadband usage across india go up by 63% last year. we need to accelerate this further., we have launched an aggressive expansion of the national optical fibre network that will take broadband to our 600,000 villages. we will connect all schools and colleges with broadband. building i-ways are as important as highways., we are expanding our public wi-fi hotspots. for example, we want to ensure that free wi fi is not only there in airport lounges, but also on our railway platforms. teaming up with google, we will cover 500 railway stations in a short time., we are also setting up common service centres in villages and towns. we will also use information technology to build smart cities., and, we want to turn our villages into smart economic hubs and connect our farmers better to markets and makes them less vulnerable to the whims of weather., for me, access also means that content should be in local languages. in a country with 22 official languages, it is a formidable, but an important task., affordability of products and services is critical for our success. there are many dimensions to this. we will promote manufacture of quality and affordable products in india. that is part of our vision of make in india, digital india and design in india., as our economy and our lives get more wired, we are also giving the highest importance to data privacy and security, intellectual property rights and cyber security., and,i know to achieve the vision of digital india, the government must also start thinking a bit like you., so, from creating infrastructure to services, from manufacture of products to human resource development, from support governments to enabling citizens and promoting digital literacy, digital india is a vast cyber world of opportunities for you., the task is huge; the challenges are many. but, we also know that we will not reach new destinations without taking new roads., much of india that we dream of is yet to be built. so, we have the opportunity to shape its path now., and, we have the talent, enterprise and skills to succeed. we also have the strength of the partnership between india and the united states., indians and americans have worked together to shape the knowledge economy. they have made us aware of the vast potential of technology., from large corporate to young professionals in this great centre of innovation, each can be part of the digital india story., the sustainable development of one-sixth of humanity will be a major force of good for our world and our planet., today, we speak of india-u.s. partnership as a defining partnership of this century. it hinges on two major reasons. both converge here in california., we all know that the dynamic asia pacific region will shape the course of this century. and, india and the united states, the world’s two largest democracies, are located at the two ends of this region.",0.1471885211562631,full text narendra modi ' speech san jose,"thank , shantanu , john , satya , paul , sunder , venkatesh , big thank ! , sure pre-arranged. ,

2015-09-28,for a win-win bilateral trade diplomacy,"rime minister narendra modi addresses ceos at digital india and digital technology dinner in san jose, california. , prime minister narendra modi’s second visit to the u.s. is garnering even more interest than his first trip, particularly because in the intervening year, the india-u.s. dialogue has intensified. the prime minister is also slated to travel to california, the first to do so at a time when people of indian origin have established themselves as frontrunners in technology and entrepreneurship in this vibrant region. indian industry has high hopes from the visit., in the run-up to the prime minister’s visit, the strategic and commercial dialogue included encouraging emphasis on economic cooperation, placing it at the heart of the india-u.s. relationship. a joint work stream on ease of doing business has been launched to address trade issues through quarterly meetings. as noted in the joint statement, cii and the american national standards institute will be setting up a portal for standards information to update trading companies on trade requirements. a notable mention was made of discussions on totalisation of social security arrangements, raising hopes that a solution could be evolved on vexing social security payments made by indian companies for their short-duration workers in the u.s., indian investments in the u.s. are robust compared to investments in the other direction in relation to sizes of respective economies. as per a cii-grant thornton report, the top indian companies in the u.s. have recorded over $15 billion of investment across all states and employ about 95,000 persons directly. u.s. investments in india stand at $28 billion cumulatively, according to u.s. sources. indian industry expects mr modi’s visit to act on a dual-pronged approach. on the one hand, issues hindering trade in goods and services need to be resolved to achieve the $500 billion trade target in the shortest possible time. on the other hand, a huge push needs to be imparted to u.s. investments in india, particularly across manufacturing and infrastructure., regarding trade, the multiple dialogue platforms revived during the past year have set the stage for new announcements. the trade policy forum, high technology cooperation group and ceos forum are looking at cooperation in areas such as agriculture, services, manufacturing and intellectual property. some of the matters taken up in these meetings include social security totalization, visa regulations, ease of doing business and international standards., trade in services can be promoted through facilitative regulations regarding movement of skilled personnel, technology and data. it is important to develop a separate work visa for professionals on short duration contracts so that they are exempted from annual quota, non-refundable social security taxes and labour conditions applications.",0.12827705627705627,win-win

2015-10-10,"first babri, now dadri","a protest in new delhi against the dadri incident. , first there was babri; now there is dadri. and in between, godhra. since 1992 and the demolition of the babri masjid by hindutva fanatics, india has moved steadily and inexorably into becoming an intolerant country where the majority rules and minorities live in fear. that process has hit an important marker, one we will not forget, with dadri, where mohammed akhlaq was brutally bludgeoned to death on the mere suspicion that he had beef in his house., on his recent visit to silicon valley, the prime minister tried to sell the world the promise of a digital india and declared that the 21st century would be india’s. that is a distant dream; the hate politics that exemplifies the murder of akhlaq is the current reality. and for this, the responsibility lies not only with fringe groups but equally with a government and a ruling party that has legitimised interference in all aspects of our lives by promoting a culture of bans and prohibition. it has claimed the right to decide what we eat, what we wear, what we read, what we view, who we meet, who we marry, who we worship and ultimately what we think., if senior bharatiya janata party functionaries can pass off mohammed akhlaq’s cold-blooded murder as an “accident” and an “unfortunate incident”, the same justification will be used when women are sexually assaulted for crossing the moral line determined by people with the same mind set as those who killed akhlaq. once you breed this type of suspicion and hatred, and justify the violence of your actions, no woman or man who thinks or acts differently is safe. is this the india we want?, we might think that such things happen more frequently in the communal cauldron of uttar pradesh and bihar. but look south. look closely at what is happening in a state like karnataka. for decades there was peace. yet, the pace of communalisation has picked up and accelerated in the last decade to the point that the district of dakshina kannada, in which the cosmopolitan city of mangaluru is located, has become the epicentre of communal tension., the fallout of this is felt most by women who have become the targets of a twisted form of moral policing. in a district where 67 per cent are hindus, 24 per cent muslims and 8 per cent christians, where the sex ratio is skewed in favour of women (1,020) unlike in the rest of the country, where female literacy is as high as 91 per cent, where a human development indicator like the infant mortality rate is substantially above the national average, young men and women are virtually forbidden from hanging out together. if they take the risk, they might have hell to pay., recent reports speak of random attacks on young people hanging out at malls, going to restaurants or going on a college trip in a so-called “mixed group”. if hindu girls are found with muslim boys, the latter are threatened and even beaten up while the former are warned. if girls, regardless of religion are found drinking alcohol, they are dragged out and shamed, as was done in the attack on a pub in 2009. if young men and women organise a private party, that too is targeted by moral vigilantes as happened in 2012 when one such birthday bash was broken up and the entire incident televised., so are we going forwards, or steadily backwards? and how will this generation of young women, educated, looking forward to careers, having access to information and communication through the internet, survive in a world where every step they take is watched? in mangaluru, a city with a huge population of young people thronging the scores of high quality educational institutions, such an atmosphere must be stifling, hardly conducive to learning or creativity., today these are stories from mangaluru; tomorrow they will happen elsewhere in india. in fact, they are happening but are not always reported., why should one worry about the response, or rather the lack of it, by the central government to this growing culture of intolerance and violence? after all, law and order is a state subject and in the case of the dadri murder, the state government of u.p. has intervened. but the combination of a silent prime minister and an unrestrained, insensitive and unapologetic culture minister (who readily expressed his regressive views on what women can and cannot do), adds up to a virtual endorsement of such actions., dadri is not a random incident; it is part of a larger picture that is emerging of the kind of india some people want to make. this is not the india envisioned by those who fought for its independence from the british. in 1947, we looked forward to a democratic, secular, plural india, where all religions are equal, where women have rights, where freedom of expression is guaranteed. join the dots and you can see clearly that the idea of india that is now being pushed envisions a monoculture where you are given no choice but to conform.",0.02469202226345084,"first babri , dadri","protest new delhi dadri incident. , first babri ; dadri. , godhra. since 1992 demolition babri masjid hindutva fanatics , india moved steadily inexorably becoming intolerant country majority rules minorities live fear. process hit important marker , one forget , dadri , mohammed akhlaq brutally bludgeoned death mere suspicion beef house. , recent visit silicon valley , prime minister tried sell world promise digital india declared 21st century would india ’ s. distant dream ; hate politics exemplifies murder akhlaq current reality. , responsibility lies fringe groups equally government ruling party legitimised interference aspects lives promoting culture bans prohibition. claimed right decide eat , wear , read , view , meet , marry , worship ultimately think. , senior bharatiya janata party functionaries pass mohammed akhlaq ’ cold-blooded murder “accident ” “unfortunate incident ” , justification used women sexually assaulted crossing moral line determined people mind set killed akhlaq. breed type suspicion hatred , justify violence actions , woman man thinks acts differently safe. india want?

2015-10-24,really harassed by facebook’s ‘real names’,"when facebook ceo mark zuckerberg holds his townhall q&a in new delhi on october 28, there is one question i would like him to answer: will he, please, scrap facebook’s ‘real names’ policy?, as it happens, i can personally vouch for its discriminatory nature, not to mention its breathtaking stupidity. three weeks ago, facebook locked me out of my account. apparently, someone had reported my name as fake. unless i submitted documentation which proved that i was me, and that my name was my real name, i could not access my account, ever., it was then that i discovered that this has been going on for a while. scores of journalists, writers, activists, political dissidents, lgbtq persons, and many vulnerable groups of people from around the world have been victimised by facebook’s absurd ‘real names’ policy and its arbitrary enforcement. like me, they all woke up one morning to find that could not access their facebook accounts. their contacts, photos, status updates, messages, followers, data — all gone., if a government body, or even a private company, were to do something like this, you could maybe visit a local office. or call customer care. but with facebook, there was nothing you could do except wait for their mails and follow their orders., coercive enforcementfor the record, facebook has had this ‘real names’ policy right from the beginning. but its enforcement had been selective, and based on reporting by users., of late, the company has been more coercive about this policy. this could be because its users have been quick to report ‘pseudonyms’ of members they don’t like for whatever reason. but i suspect there might be other, rather mercenary, reasons: one, pressure to guarantee to its advertisers that all of its 1.4 billion profiles are ‘authentic’; and two, arm-twist users into surrendering high value, government-validated data about themselves., so this is how it plays out. say you don’t like someone’s status updates. and say her profile doesn’t have what seems like a regular name. maybe it has a dictionary-listed word in it – as mine did. you can report it to facebook as a pseudonymous profile. the more the number of users who report a given profile, the more likely it is that facebook will block it and notify the user, asking her to submit documentation that authenticates her profile name as the one she uses in real life. until she does so, and unless facebook accepts her identity proofs as valid (too often it doesn’t), she’ll remain locked out of her account., this policy of facebook’s has been a boon for authoritarian governments seeking to silence dissent without attracting the attendant bad press. typically, they employ a mob of trolls who report dissident profiles — which are necessarily pseudonymous for safety reasons — as fake, prompting facebook to shut them down. the most successful of such mobs is the pro-assad syrian electronic army (sea), which has eliminated several alternative voices on the ongoing conflict in syria (http://tinyurl.com/ksmw8eg)., facebook has similarly shut down dissident or marginal political voices in vietnam, russia, egypt, china, honduras, tanzania, ethiopia, and of course, india, as well. when anti-caste activist preetha g.p. was attacked by a mob of trolls, facebook reacted by suspending her account and forcing her to reveal her caste surname (http://tinyurl.com/opmrnks)., a substantial number of those victimized by this policy are lgbtq and trans-gender people living in countries where alternative sexualities are criminalised and/or stigmatised. they had found a haven of sorts in facebook, where they used pseudonyms to bond with others like themselves. but facebook’s policy has either locked many of them out or publicised their legal names and gender — putting their lives in danger. other vulnerable groups unjustly targeted by facebook’s policy include native americans, stalking survivors, and domestic violence survivors., in response to all these abuses, on october 5, 2015, a coalition of more than 70 human rights organisations wrote a letter to facebook, asking it to either scrap its ‘real names’ policy or amend it suitably. this coalition — which calls itself the nameless coalition — includes groups such as human rights watch, american civil liberties union, electronic frontier foundation, and free women writers of afghanistan, among others., terming facebook’s ‘real names’ policy as “culturally biased and technically flawed,” the letter states that it “exposes its users to danger, disrespects the identities of its users, and curtails free speech.” the letter charges facebook with a “policy of excluding users in a discriminatory manner”, adding that “under international human rights standards, companies have a responsibility to respect human rights and to provide remedies for any abuses they cause or contribute to”., identity controlled, coming back to my own experience, my initial reaction to being locked out was – good riddance! i have always been ambivalent about facebook. now that i was locked out, i could get back to real life on a full-time basis. or so i thought., but facebook had me where it wanted. i was travelling, and had made important appointments over facebook. without access to my account, i had no way of communicating with these people, of knowing where to meet them, or even letting them know that there was a problem. the irony was that i’d stayed away from facebook for the longest time to avoid precisely such a scenario. but facebook is clever. it doesn’t enforce its ‘real names’ policy when you first sign up — no identity proofs are required. it strikes only when you’ve been lured in and truly trapped. i had no choice but to obey facebook if i wanted to retrieve data pertaining to my travel and work., after locking me out, facebook emailed me asking for my ‘authentic’ name. i sent it my authentic name — the byline you see with this article. facebook emailed back to inform me that i must be mistaken — my authentic name could not be g. sampath. i sent another email, pointing out that facebook’s “simplistic system doesn’t recognise non-western nomenclatures. please check with a tamil-speaking member of your team if my name is authentic or not.”, it made no difference. facebook insisted that i email it a government-issued document that had my “authentic identity”, my photograph, and my date of birth on it., after much anguish (all wasted), i sent facebook a scanned copy of my driver’s licence. facebook rejected it. i finally sent facebook my pan card — taking care to hide my pan number. it somehow passed muster. facebook wrote back to say that the door was open and i could crawl back in., on the bright side, i had nothing much to lose — apart from my virtual dignity, which shall remain forever diminished by my humiliating surrender to facebook’s ridiculous demands. the technical forfeiture of my already vandalised privacy doesn’t count. but the loss — in the case of a syrian dissident forced into silence, or an lgbt person forced out of the closet, or a human rights activist picked up by the secret police — is incalculable., digital dystopiathis state of affairs raises several uncomfortable questions, especially now that we are tripping over each other to usher in a so-called digital india., entities such as facebook and google are not public institutions and, therefore, not subject to laws like the rti. and yet, given that they offer the public what have become more or less life-critical services, — services patronised by a huge swathe of humanity — how do we make their functioning transparent, and accountable to both individual users and to society?, what if google decides to suspend your email account tomorrow? what recourse do you have? given that facebook has become a vital political platform for dissemination of non-mainstream views and news, shouldn’t there be a democratic mechanism to hold it responsible for its actions in shutting down dissident pages?, after all, a facebook or a google can always turn around and say, “if you don’t like us, stay away!” that’s one of the advantages of a market society — rights wither away and dissolve into meaningless choices.",0.06632059511369852,really harassed facebook ’ ‘real names ’,"facebook ceo

2015-10-28,salesmanship as statesmanship,"to characterise the foreign policy of the most peripatetic indian prime minister as ‘nationalist’ may appear contradictory. the popular demand today is that he should be in india more often, to deal with the crying needs of the country. he is selective in his eloquence on domestic issues, but he is opening out his heart to >foreign audiences. he is seen more in the company of foreign leaders, not only political leaders, but also leaders in technology, finance and economics. but the core of his agenda is domestic, not international. his >arena is international, but his concerns are domestic., the transformation of india’s foreign policy from an ‘internationalist’ one to a ‘nationalist’ one may well have begun after jawaharlal nehru and v.k. krishna menon. domestic preoccupations were brought to centre stage, though the old tradition of engagement in world affairs remained alive. the torrent of international issues — such as the conflicts in indo-china and korea, the suez canal crisis and even the conflict in austria — in all of which india played a role without any specific agenda for itself, became a trickle., perhaps our early day interventions happened because of the activism of the non-aligned movement (nam), which pronounced itself on every major international issue in its declarations. by shaping those pronouncements, mainly by balancing and moderating them, india found fulfilment in playing its international role. it did not find it necessary to take initiatives to resolve disputes or avert conflicts, except in its own neighbourhood. our insistence on bilateralism in resolving issues may also have been an inhibiting factor., from international to regional in the post-cold war era, india’s internationalism began to be confined to regional and other groupings, most of them economic. concerns about the protection of the global commons, such as the environment, assumed importance. we began looking at protecting our own interests, taking positions like ‘no mandatory reduction of green house gases for the developing countries’. we realised that our interests coincided with those of the great powers and the large developing countries like brazil and even china. copenhagen was a real turning point in our environment policy when we virtually disowned the kyoto protocol except in name. our nuclear tests in 1998 and the subsequent nuclear deal with the united states left india with no like-minded countries in disarmament. it was the arm-twisting by the u.s. that made the nuclear suppliers group (nsg) provide us an exemption., unsc membership we had earlier used the non-aligned position that only non-permanent membership should be increased until comprehensive reform is accomplished, just to thwart the u.s. sponsored quick fix solution of germany and japan being made permanent members. however, we then moved on to the g-4 initiative — under which india, brazil, japan and germany would seek permanent membership — which has very few takers among the small developing countries. the g-77 virtually disappeared from many forums because india’s leadership in it withered away., india continued to take a >global view in g-20 and the world trade organization (wto), primarily because of the reputation of dr. manmohan singh as an economic guru, even for barack obama. dr. manmohan singh’s withdrawal from the international arena and his close relationship with the u.s. in india’s interests changed the nehruvian view that india’s dreams coincided with the world’s dreams. during our last term at the u.n. security council, india seemed to be in a dilemma as to whether we should work with the nonaligned caucus or plough a lonely furrow; we ended up in flip-flops. both the permanent members and the nonaligned caucus found our term a mixed blessing., “a study of prime minister modi’s visits and speeches reveals that his strategy is that of a businessman, one who makes deals only for benefits. his neighbourhood policy is an example ”, mr. modi’s surprise initiatives in foreign policy from day one seemed to project him as an internationalist. as raja mohan summarised in his book modi’s world, “he warmed up to america, recast the approach to china and pakistan, sustained the old friendship with russia, deepened the strategic partnership with japan and australia, boosted india’s neighbourhood policy, wooed international business leaders and reconnected with the indian diaspora.”, we could add to this his championship of the >reform of the security council; his stress on the environment; and him taking initiatives on getting closer to france, germany, canada, the island states and now africa. but the change is not only in style and eloquence, but in turning indian foreign policy inward. he has abandoned internationalism, genuine in the case of some of his predecessors and a cloak in the case of some others. in any relationship, the litmus test now is: what india can gain for itself, not what india can contribute to the humanity., focusing on national interests in formulating foreign policy is fundamental for all countries. but turning statesmanship to salesmanship is a new phenomenon in indian foreign policy. our tradition has been to provide leadership to the world, not to demand it as our right, as mr. modi did in the case of the permanent membership of the security council. speaking of our eminent qualifications is one thing, but claiming it as a right may drive our supporters away. our case was that we were willing to serve on the council to restore the balance there and to make it more relevant, not to claim membership as a right to protect our interests. even the permanent members never claim that they have a right to be there., a close study of the choice of countries mr. modi has visited and the speeches he has made would reveal that his strategy is that of a pragmatic businessman who will make deals for his benefit, but the moment the profit dwindles, he will go in search of new clients. his neighbourhood policy is a case in point. he started off with the ambition to remove poverty in south asia through a >renewed south asian association for regional cooperation (saarc), but soon discovered the perfidy of pakistan. he persisted for a while as india had much to gain from a transformation in india-pakistan relations. however, saarc is no longer a priority in his development agenda. nepal is another case where his hopes were belied. remember the cordiality and the oneness he projected with nepal in the name of the eternal values the two countries shared? however, today, he has virtually imposed an embargo on nepal for not listening to our advice. indira gandhi did the same once, but she had explained repeatedly to the international community the rationale for her actions and had restored normalcy after a while. the world will watch our policies and make conclusions on our reliability and statesmanship., misplaced notion of grandeur the common elements in mr. modi’s speeches abroad can be clearly identified. first and foremost, it is the grandeur of india and his own role as its man of destiny. second, he claims that things have changed dramatically since he took over and that india is now ready to receive investments and recognition as a global player. he feels the world has a stake in india’s development and security and that it is imperative for other countries to work with india., he does not offer any specific concessions but expects the others to respond to his initiatives for their own benefit. according to him, ‘>make in india’ and ‘>digital india’ are opportunities for the world to promote india and derive benefits for themselves. in other words, the logic is one applied to a honest business in which every partner makes profit.",0.1149704508974172,salesmanship statesmanship,"characterise foreign policy peripatetic indian prime minister

2015-11-03,"boost trade ties with indonesia, says ansari","in spite of india and indonesia having been trade partners since the 2nd century b.c., their bilateral trade and investment had not realized its full potential, said vice-president hamid ansari on tuesday. addressing the indian business forum here, he said the two nations must “synergise our efforts in areas of economy and business”., mr. ansari pointed out that, in 2014-15 india’s total imports from indonesia totaled as much as $15 billion while the exports came to just $4 billion. citing this stark “imbalance of trade”, mr. ansari said the complementarities between the two nations must be harnessed in attracting investments: “india’s vast consumer market, youthful skilled human resources, and expertise in it, combined with indonesia’s natural resources, youthful population, and strategic location, would provide a platform for enhanced economic cooperation and engagement”., acknowledging the links between the two nations, indonesian vice-president jusuf kalla pointed out that indian businessmen had prominence in indonesia – he recalled that lakshmi narayan mittal had sowed the seeds of his business empire with a modest steel plant in east java., india, the largest buyer of crude palm oil from indonesia, also imports coal, minerals, rubber, pulp, hydrocarbons in significant quantities from the nation. among its major exports to indonesia are refined petroleum products, maize, telecommunication equipment, commercial vehicles and oil seeds., mr. ansari identified infrastructure development and energy security as key areas of cooperation with its “long-term strategic partner”. he sought to assure the business community in jakarta that initiatives like make in india, digital india, and the smart cities project had created massive opportunity for foreign investors to become partners in building the indian economy. the nationwide connectivity arising from such initiatives had made a tremendous

2015-12-11,delivering on the digital promise,"""much of growth in trade will be spurred by digital india and the robust technology industry.” picture shows a digital india banner in new delhi. photo: sandeep saxena , we are all guilty of judging the narendra modi government’s success on whether it can get major legislative reforms passed through parliament. the international community, media, and think tanks have obsessed over the goods and services tax (gst) bill, land acquisition bill, and labour law reforms. the focus on big-ticket items fuelled the coverage of the bihar elections. it was considered a bellwether state for the bjp and the prime minister’s future. after all, the thinking went, “if you can’t win bihar, you can’t secure a majority in the rajya sabha, and then you can’t pass any major economic reforms over the objections of the opposition”., the problem with the continued focus on gst and these other bills is that it ignores the prime minister’s flagship programme — digital india — which can be implemented in large part without parliamentary assent., the prime minister has rightfully spent significant political capital on his digital india initiative. he has put out press releases, done roll-out events, and become the first indian prime minister in over three decades to tour silicon valley. while visiting the headquarters of google, tesla, and facebook, he made the case that technology, innovation, and his digital india programme should serve as the centrepiece of u.s.-india relations. we couldn’t agree more., in the last decade, the u.s. and india have worked hand in hand to nearly triple annual bilateral trade, which currently stands at $102 billion. this is promising, but we are a long way from achieving the jointly stated goal of $500 billion. much of tomorrow’s growth in trade will be spurred by digital india and the robust technology industry., a potential game changerat its heart, digital india is an ambitious vision that has the potential to be an equaliser for indians by driving inclusive growth for the economy. digital india connects villages with broadband. it brings better, more accessible, governance to the people. it encompasses the entire gamut of prime minister modi’s other initiatives — india’s national financial inclusion plan that aims to connect every indian to a bank account, building 100 smart cities, and the make in india programme designed to spur local manufacturing and job creation., if the above programmes are implemented properly, india will enjoy the benefits of historic economic growth. indeed, mckinsey and co. estimated that the adoption of key technologies and policies across sectors spurred by the digital india initiative could help boost india’s gross domestic product (gdp) by $550 billion, propelling its gdp to $1 trillion by 2025., big numbers are tantalising, but they must be paired with sound policy — the foundation on which innovation, economic growth, and social progress is built., the crown jewel in the digital india programme lies in the private sector’s ability to innovate new technologies that enhance and modernise the way business and civic life are carried out. for india to achieve its full potential, prime minister modi must implement digital india in collaboration with the private sector., there are three policy reforms that american enterprise desires in order to enable india to achieve these social and economic goals. again, these reforms do not require parliamentary action., first, india should vigorously pursue the expansion of broadband and it infrastructure throughout the country. eighty-five per cent of indians still don’t have access to the internet, and a majority of them live in rural india. this is far short of the near-universal access and connectivity envisaged by the digital india mission. the government is currently investing resources to improve the efficiency of india’s national optical fibre network in an effort to provide broadband across the country and erase connectivity gaps. however, there remain significant gaps in last-mile connectivity, and this is a particularly ripe area for private sector collaboration. for example, making it easier to obtain clearances to install cell phone towers is one way to deal with the connectivity problem. lifting the ban on foreign satellite operators that can provide spectrum is another. both approaches should be pursued in tandem., second, in the spirit of promoting digital india and innovation, e-commerce models should enable small- and medium-sized businesses across india to reach national and global consumers. the recent bihar loss was quickly followed by the government’s announcement to open up foreign direct investment (fdi) in a number of sectors. while these reforms were largely welcome, they did not touch business-to-consumer e-commerce. fdi in that sector remains restricted, meaning smaller indian e-commerce companies cannot seek the capital they need to grow their business and hire more employees. equally troubling, small- and medium-sized indian manufacturers, who are vital to the make in india programme, are held back by their lack of access to broader domestic and international consumer markets. accordingly, the department of industrial policy and promotion should allow at least 51 per cent fdi in e-commerce — and ultimately 100 per cent.",0.07904329004329004,delivering digital promise,""" much growth trade spurred digital india robust technology industry. ” picture shows digital india banner new delhi. photo :

2015-12-27,gadget buffs may have to forego their fix,"vivek gupta, an all india trinamool congress mp, has proposed a law to prevent children and teenagers from being addicted to technological gadgets arguing they are isolating themselves socially and that the rising addiction is destroying the country’s cultural ethos., the private member’s bill that was introduced in rajya sabha on december 4 comes amidst a global debate on the subject with a growing number of experts expressing concern over the addictive properties of these devices. countries such as china, south korea and japan have identified the addiction to technological gadgets as a serious problem. south korea has, in fact, passed a law to restrict access to gaming websites for children for particular time periods every day, “the problem of gadget addiction in the country is getting serious by the day…the excessive use of technological gadgets is extremely detrimental to the health of population especially young and growing children,” according to the proposed bill., the gadgets, such as mobile phones, laptops, gaming devices and tablets, are turning children into couch potatoes; hampering their physical, mental and psychological growth as well as making them isolated from the society, mr gupta said., a survey by it security solutions firm, kaspersky lab, revealed that 73 per cent of the respondents in india were found to be ‘digital addicts’., due to this “disorder,” people stay glued into their technological gadgets at all times of the day, according to the bill., “may it be while driving or crossing the road or even while performing daily life tasks such as eating or using the washroom, people just cannot move away from their technological gadgets,” the text of the draft bill notes. “this problem is slowly but steadily penetrating into indian households and has the capability of destroying the ethos of cultural traditions of the country.” through the bill, mr gupta makes a case to recognise addiction to gadgets as a mental illness and a form of substance abuse, while insisting that the government take steps to create appropriate awareness about the addiction through television, radio and print., “our whole existence today is dependent on gadgets. even at social gatherings people are busy checking their whatsapp messages or twitter feed. there is no human interaction,” mr gupta told the hindu on the rationale behind his bill. “this is also affecting our health. there are reports that say it impacts our cervical angle.” while most bills are proposed by the government, those presented by individual mps are described as private member's bills. generally, most private bills do not get passed. they act as an instrument to draw attention to a particular issue., the bill states that china became the first country in the world to declare internet addiction a clinical disorder in the year 2008. later, in the year 2013, south korea’s government stated that one in every five students was addicted to smartphone usage. a study published by the japanese government too said that in the 2013, 8.1 per cent of about 100,000 junior-high and high-school students polled were likely to be “pathologically” addicted to the internet., “the government of south korea has passed a shutdown law also known as cinderella law whereby children under the age of 16 are not allowed to access gaming websites from midnight till 6 a.m.,” according to the bill., asked about the relevance of the bill, at a time when the government is working toward bringing all citizens online under its flagship digital india initiative, mr. gupta said the motive was to attract government’s attention to the problem and make them understand that some kind of monitoring should be there., “people should be made aware… sensitivity should be there so that people can make informed choice… you go to a dinner, you want your smartphone, you want to go for a swim or a jog, the phone should be there… excess should be avoided everywhere,” he said., the bill calls for setting up of digital detoxification centres to ensure that the “patients suffering from gadgets or internet overdose are treated in an effective manner so that they can live a more peaceful and happy life.”, moreover, this bill also mandates the creation of national research centre for prevention of technological gadget addiction in the country. “with efforts being made to promote the digital technologies in the country at every stage by the government, it is also necessary that appropriate laws are created in order to prevent the ill effects of the over usage of the same.”, ***, interestingly, there are about a dozen free application that are available for download on android or an ios powered device that help users keep a tab on their smartphone addiction levels and even remind them to take some time off from the digital world. most of these apps work in a similar manner, tracking and monitoring the amount of time a user spends on the phone and giving a heads-up when it might be time for a break. some of these are:, breakfree: it monitors phone usage in the background and notifies user incase they have used a particular app for long or are making too many calls or have used the phone for over an hour., appdetox: it lets users set their own rules for usage of different applications such as facebook and

2015-12-30,"crony connectivity, and internet for us","if the objective is to connect the whole world to the internet, then free basics by facebook (previously known as internet.org) is a controversial method to achieve it. the company wants to provide a subset of the internet free of charge to consumers, with mobile telecom operators bearing the costs of the traffic. facebook acts as the unpaid gatekeeper of the platform., this kind of arrangement has come to be called “zero rating” and attracted criticism from internet civil society groups like the electronic frontier foundation. it argues that the free basics scheme has “one unavoidable, inherent flaw: facebook’s central role, which puts it in a privileged position to monitor its users’ traffic, and allows it to act as gatekeeper (or, depending on the situation, censor)... there is no technical restriction that prevents the company from monitoring and recording the traffic of free basics users. unfortunately, this means there is no guarantee that the good faith promise facebook has made today to protect free basics users’ privacy will be permanent.”, monopolists vs free marketin india, internet civil society activists are opposing facebook’s scheme for additional reasons. while the attempt to introduce new users to the internet is a good thing, they argue, the scheme risks breaking the network into many smaller ones and skewing the playing field in favour of apps and services that enjoy privileged pricing., zero rating in general and free basics by facebook in particular has many defenders among advocates of free markets and capitalism. they argue that if the mobile operator wishes to lose money or cross-subsidise some users at the cost of others, then it should be allowed to do so. government intervention in pricing usually has bad unintended consequences, and it should be no different in the case of internet traffic., the telecom regulatory authority of india (trai) has re-engaged in a public consultation seeking submissions on which path it should take: the conservative path of insisting on net neutrality, a laissez-faire approach of non-intervention in the decisions of private firms, or other options in between these two., what seems to be taken for granted but should really surprise us is that companies and policymakers accept that getting the developing world online requires methods that are different from how the developed countries got there. so, how did the hundreds of millions of people around the world become internet subscribers? not because of government schemes, but because they could afford it. they could afford it because market forces — competition — drove prices down to levels that made an internet connection affordable. unless government policies get in the way, there is no reason why the same forces will not reduce prices further to make the service affordable to ever more people, with lower disposable incomes., there is empirical evidence for this: the 980 million mobile phone subscribers in india are able to make phone calls because they can afford the charges. even after some price capping by trai, most mobile telecom operators are doing well. despite persistent call drops and atrocious customer service, consumers enjoy reasonably good service and the industry as a whole is fairly healthy., all this happened without a mobile phone operator providing free calls to a limited set of numbers in order to demonstrate the value of mobile phones and to encourage more people to take up subscriptions. operators did, however, innovate in retailing, launching prepaid packages and recharging these connections. on the flip side, they also cut costs by skimping on customer service, overloading spectrum and sharing tower infrastructure., competition is the keytrai should reflect on its own success in transforming india from a low teledensity country to a moderately high teledensity one. this happened not due to “no-frills services for poor and developing country users” but by ensuring that market competition is allowed to take its course. there is no reason why mobile internet services will not become as popular as mobile phone services as long as there is adequate competition., therefore, the debate on whether or not to permit zero rating is beside the point. what trai ought to be asking is whether there is sufficient competition in its current policy framework. should it be licensing more telecom operators? has the government made enough spectrum available so that mobile operators can lower prices and ensure adequate service quality? are there bottlenecks in the hands of monopolists that raise the costs of service?, the path to achieving the dream of digital india lies not in foreign companies deciding on what basic services india’s poor ought to access free of charge, but by encouraging ever greater competition and a level playing field. this calls for the regulator to have a hawkish approach towards anti-competitive behaviour by existing market players., now, let’s say that the government really wishes to make the internet affordable to citizens whose incomes are too low to pay for it. there is a good case for this based on positive externalities: that some benefits of an individual’s connection to the internet accrue to society as a whole. much like primary education, an internet connection allows a citizen to participate in the modern economy. just as society as a whole benefits if all citizens are educated, it benefits if all citizens are connected. to be clear, this is not an argument for the government to run telecom businesses. rather, it is to say that it is in the public interest for nearly everyone to be connected to the internet., growth as a force multiplierwhile it is tempting to provide free or subsidised services — like we do in india for many such things — the best method to achieve this outcome is to raise people’s incomes. if the indian economy grows at 8 per cent over several years, the income effect will make internet connections more affordable even if prices do not fall.",0.19973427366284505,"crony connectivity , internet us","objective connect whole world internet , free basics facebook ( previously known internet.org ) controversial method achieve it. company wants provide subset internet free charge consumers , mobile telecom operators bearing costs traffic. facebook acts unpaid gatekeeper platform. , kind arrangement come called “zero rating ” attracted criticism internet civil society groups like electronic frontier foundation. argues free basics scheme “one unavoidable , inherent flaw : facebook ’ central role , puts privileged position monitor users ’ traffic , allows act gatekeeper ( , depending situation , censor ) ... technical restriction prevents company monitoring recording traffic free basics users. unfortunately , means guarantee good faith promise facebook made today protect free basics users ’ privacy permanent. ” , monopolists vs free marketin india , internet civil society activists opposing facebook ’ scheme additional reasons. attempt introduce new users internet good thing , argue , scheme risks breaking network many smaller ones skewing playing field favour apps services enjoy privileged pricing. , zero rating general free basics facebook particular many defenders among advocates free markets capitalism. argue mobile operator wishes lose money cross-subsidise users cost others , allowed so. government intervention pricing usually bad unintended consequences , different case internet traffic. , telecom regulatory authority india ( trai ) re-engaged public consultation seeking submissions path take : conservative path insisting net neutrality , laissez-faire approach non-intervention decisions private firms , options two. , seems taken granted really surprise us companies policymakers accept getting developing world online requires methods different developed countries got there. , hundreds millions people around world become internet subscribers ?

2016-01-15,tech tonic for the heart of india,"cgnet swara is a voice-based online portal that allows people in the central gondwana region to report local news by making a phone call. photo: cgnetswara.org , one winter morning, in barwani district of madhya pradesh, i was watching a group of adivasi kids peering into their mobile phones. the early morning sun was mellow, and they were so engrossed that they did not notice me drawing near., “we are doing bultoo sir,” one of them told me when i asked what they were doing., it took me some time to understand that they were transferring audio and video files using bluetooth technology in their mobile phones., i was in barwani to take a class on citizen journalism with adivasi children., later, i discovered that more than 80 per cent of the students had bluetooth in their mobile phones and actively use it to share audio and video files with each other. i had no idea that even my mobile phone is bluetooth-enabled. i had never used it. on the other end of central india, in balrampur district, on the border of chhattisgarh and jharkhand, i found a similar phenomenon. it is a maoist insurgency-affected district with a large proportion of oraon tribals, who speak a language called kuduk. an experiment here has thrown up a model for how to solve the problem., eighty per cent of balrampur’s gram panchayats are connected by optical fibre cables thanks to the digital india push by prime minister narendra modi., the problem is, there is broadband but there isn’t much content in kuduk on the internet., experimenting with possibilitiesthe mobile phone is common in every household even in this remote adivasi district. people earlier used it only to make calls. now, they also use it to report on the happenings around them and to listen to the “bultoo radio”. if wages under the mahatma gandhi national rural employment guarantee act (mgnrega) haven’t been paid, if forest right deeds have not been distributed, they report about it in kuduk. once the messages get recorded on a central computer connected via the internet, they also get translated into hindi and english. then it reaches officers such as collector alex paul menon, who was once abducted by the maoists, and also reaches each gram panchayat. one person from each village comes to the gram panchayat office every day and downloads the daily programme of “bultoo radio” on his mobile phone and shares it with all villagers upon return., “bultoo radio” is a small experiment being carried out over a small area but its problem-solving potential and its use of the local idiom can bring people’s faith back in the system. some thing similar can also be done with short-wave radio, which people here tune into to listen to programmes broadcast by evangelical christian groups based in places such as the philippines. balrampur has internet in most of its gram panchayats but dantewada doesn’t in even 1 per cent of its panchayats — “bultoo radio” will not work there, but short wave will., the maoist problem is basically a problem of communication breakdown: while maoists, missionaries, mining companies reach out to the adivasis, mainstream india remains blissfully cocooned. there are no officers, no journalists who understand adivasi languages such as kuduk, gondi. the maoists did not come to the dandakaranya forests to effect a revolution, they came here to hide. despite the maoists interacting and working with adivasis for 40 years in the region, there are hardly any adivasi maoist leaders. at any rate, less than 1 per cent of the maoists in central india use violence as a tool to change politics; 99 per cent of them have been sold an illusion that once their “raj” comes, all their problems will be solved, the problems of forest, land, water, health and education., connecting with the adivasisindia needs to have two strategies to solve the maoist problem, one for maoists and one for maoist supporters who make it “india’s biggest internal security threat”., there are more maoist sympathisers in our cities but not many go on to join them; adivasis become maoist supporters because we do not talk to them, because we do not help them solve their problems. mainstream india only talks to the ‘creamy layer’ of adivasis, those who have learnt our languages. many a time, this small but powerful section has let down fellow adivasi brethren more than any outsider., reaching out to the adivasis living in remote areas is admittedly difficult since many of these areas are controlled by maoists, but we can talk to them through the airwaves. we need to reinvent the radio to solve the maoist problem. we need to democratise short-wave radio. we need to be creative like “bultoo radio”., with many adivasis now having access to mobile phones, we need to train and encourage them to record their songs and report their problems in their language on platforms such as cgnet swara, a voice-based online portal that allows people in the central gondwana region to report local news by making a phone call. their messages, when recorded, need to be relayed to the authorities who can then proactively take up their issues. the fact that their problems have been solved should be relayed back to the adivasis on shortwave radio in their own languages. never mind the connectivity issues, even if they do not receive mobile phone network signals in their village, they can at least receive signals in most of their weekly markets that they visit every week. “radio does not speak in our languages and talks about barack obama, osama bin laden, which we do not understand,” the locals tell me., a bottom-up approach gondi is the lingua franca of the maoist movement today, but all india radio does not broadcast even a single new bulletin in the language. a top-down all india radio will anyway be of little use; we should strive to create a bottom-up media which is more participatory. we need adivasi broadcasting cooperatives. we need democratic and real social media., india is the world’s largest democracy but it has not allowed radio for public use yet. one can launch a newspaper and a television channel but not a radio station. this needs to change. radio must be regulated as any other media but a free radio, including medium wave and short wave, linked with mobile phone and internet, can solve the maoist problem. fm is an urban phenomenon;

2016-02-08,trai rules in favour of net neutrality,"the telecom regulatory authority of india (trai) on monday barred telecom service providers from charging differential rates for data services, effectively prohibiting facebook’s free basics and airtel zero platform by airtel in their current form., “no service provider shall offer or charge discriminatory tariffs for data services on the basis of content,” the regulator ruled in its prohibition of discriminatory tariffs for data services regulations, 2016. it said the prohibition was necessary to keep the internet open and non-discriminatory., trai said a fine of rs. 50,000 would be levied per day, subject to a maximum of rs. 50 lakh, for any violation of these regulations by the service providers. an exemption, however, has been made for offering emergency services., ruling out case-by-case approval for plans that might be priced differently, the regulator said a clear policy should be formulated., no differential rates for data services, rules trai, “we had issued a consultation paper just about 60 days ago on differential pricing …we deliberated on the issue for quite some time … anything on internet cannot be differently priced. this is the broad point that we have highlighted in the regulation,” trai chairman r.s. sharma told reporters at a conference., the regulator and facebook have been at loggerheads over the issue with the authority terming the social networking giant’s attempt to lobby for its free basics initiative a “crude” attempt at turning the consultation over differential pricing of data services into an “orchestrated opinion poll” on free basics. facebook had partnered with reliance communications in india to offer free basics service. however, the services were put in abeyance, post a trai order to this effect., disappointed: facebook, in an emailed statement, a facebook spokesperson said, “while disappointed with the outcome, we will continue our efforts to eliminate barriers and give the unconnected an easier path to the internet and the opportunities it brings.”, the trai said tariff for data services could not vary on the basis of the website/application/ platform/ or type of content being accessed. for example, a consumer could not be charged differently based on whether she was browsing social media site a or b, or on whether she was watching streaming videos or shopping on the internet, it added., it, however, said that to bring more users on the internet, this prohibition would not apply to other forms of tariff differentiation that were entirely independent of content. “for instance, providing limited free data that enables user to access the entire internet is not prohibited,” the trai said., while the move was cheered by net neutrality activists and industry bodies such as nasscom and iamai, telecom operators, who had been pushing for allowing of differential tariff for data service, expressed disappointment saying the ruling would impact the narendra modi government’s ambitious digital india initiative., rajan mathews, director-general of operators’ body coai, told the hindu: “we are very disappointed with the ruling. differential pricing is an effective marketing tool and would have helped in bringing online the next one billion people. we are confused as the decision comes at a time when the government is pushing adoption of internet.”, “it will negatively impact the growth of the industry and the consumers who may need such plans to afford data connections. we are looking at this closely to examine trai’s rationale as to how this purportedly hurts customers or negatively impacts markets or even hinders internet access,” he said., hemant joshi, partner, deloitte haskins & sells llp, said differential pricing for different levels of services was a well-accepted principle across all industries and the concept inherently recognised the economic principle of paying differently for different levels of service and experience., “for example, the differential pricing for the 2nd class, 1st ac, sleeper class, etc. based on different experiences and service levels … in the telecom sector there are virtual highways that need to follow the same principle. eu is considering allowing ‘specialised services’ with few priority services having fast lane internet connection. more awareness and education needed around the economics of differential pricing and its long-term implications on the industry and the consumer,” mr. joshi said., amresh nandan, research director, gartner, said while operators might not be happy with this notification, they still have the ability and freedom to create different kind of internet access packages as long as content was not a parameter to provide or bar access to anyone. “such practices have already started elsewhere with products such as bandwidth on demand, bandwidth calendaring etc. to create premium products.

2016-02-12,india’s digital transformation,"“india has not yet taken full advantage of the digital revolution.” picture shows a rickshaw puller in kolkata. , there is little doubt that china has stolen a march on india when it comes to leveraging the internet. of the top 20 internet companies in the world, 13 are american, five are chinese, with one each for japan and the united kingdom. alibaba, china’s largest e-commerce company, has a market capitalisation that is 25 times higher than that of flipkart, the largest e-commerce company in india., why did india, which has had the remarkable achievement of being the largest exporter of information technology services and skilled manpower among developing countries, fall behind china in digitally transforming its economy? is it now making a comeback? the world bank’s recently released world development report (wdr) ‘digital dividends’ provides some answers., the wdr finds that digital technologies have spread rapidly throughout much of the world, but their digital dividends — the broader development benefits from using these technologies — have lagged behind. in many instances digital technologies have boosted growth, expanded opportunities, and improved service delivery. yet their aggregate impact has fallen short and is unevenly distributed., the report argues that for digital technologies to confer their full benefit on society, it is vital to close the digital divide, especially in internet access. but greater digital adoption will not be enough. to get the most out of the digital revolution, countries also need to work on its “analogue complements” — by strengthening regulations that ensure competition among businesses, by adapting workers’ skills to the demands of the new economy, and by ensuring that government institutions and others are accountable., measuring the performance of india and china with the wdr metrics of connectivity and complements shows why india has not yet taken full advantage of the digital revolution., at the end of 2014, india had 227 million internet users, compared to 665 million in china. fewer than two out of every five indian businesses had an online presence compared to almost two-thirds of firms in china., the cost of a 1 mbit/s residential broadband service in india is 6-10 times higher than in china. and by most accounts, the digital divide across age, gender, geography and income within india is significantly higher than in china. thanks to its successful digital id programme, aadhaar, india scores higher than china in digital adoption by governments, but the need now is to use the platform that aadhaar provides more widely and effectively., amartya sen has written extensively on the idea of human ‘capability’. this concept has large applications in the digital world. unfortunately, not only does india have a higher digital access gap, it also has a bigger digital capability gap. the capability gap, according to the wdr, arises from two main sources: the overall business climate and the quality of human capital., despite some commendable improvements in cutting bureaucratic costs faced by small and medium enterprises, india scores considerably below china in doing business indicators. it is important for india to create space for creativity and enterprise and to promote competition., the slow pace of improvement of the quality of basic infrastructure — expressways, logistics, storage, postal delivery system and reliable supply of electricity — have also hampered the growth of e-commerce in india. and the excessively cautious approach of indian regulators towards disruptive technological innovations such as mobile money or ride-sharing services has made it difficult for digital start-ups to enter new markets and achieve scale., while indian technology workers and entrepreneurs excel in silicon valley in the united states, the skills level of the average indian worker remains significantly behind his or her chinese counterpart. india has made considerable strides in improving its human capital, but a vast majority of its population still lacks the skills to meaningfully participate in the digital economy., around 25 per cent of india’s adult population cannot read and write compared to fewer than 5 per cent in china., there is also major difference in quality of education: the latest annual status of education report (aser) test scores in rural india show that 10 per cent of children aged 16 and below cannot identify single-digit numbers consistently. fewer than one in five can do a subtraction, performing considerably below their grade level., clearly, india’s challenge to becoming a digital economy remains formidable. the government has announced a slew of new initiatives: digital india; make in india; start-up india; and innovative applications of aadhaar such as jam (jan-dhan yojana-aadhaar-mobile trinity) and digital lockers. successful and accelerated implementation of these programmes can make up for some of the lost time. but india also needs to do more by strengthening the basic foundations of its digital economy., making the internet accessible, open and safe for all indians is an urgent priority. the cost of mobile phone access is already low by international standards. and with a supportive policy environment involving smart spectrum management, public-private partnerships, and intelligent regulations of internet markets, the same can be achieved for internet access. zero-rated services for mobile data access have become controversial, though they could be an intermediate step to fully open and affordable internet access for the poorest, provided that the choice of selecting services is transparent and inclusive., access, however, is only one part of the agenda. an important lesson from the wdr is that even the most sophisticated technologies are no substitute for tackling long-standing shortcomings in other areas — most importantly basic health, education and a regulatory ethos that encourages competition and enterprise., when the world bank adopted in 2013 “shared prosperity” as one of its mission goals, it was the first time that combating inequality was being set up as a target. there was a lot of initial opposition because while the battling of poverty seems like a fairly impersonal goal, the goal of “sharing” makes many uncomfortable., fortunately, the way the shared prosperity goal is formalised has deep conceptual roots. one of the best accounts is to be found in s. subramanian’s ‘“inclusive development” and the quintile income statistic’, in economic and political weekly and this goal is now increasingly being recognised as vital for a better world. the aim of ending the digital divide discussed in our most recent wdr stems from this same basic idea and is an urgent need of our times.",0.13791791541791545,india ’ digital transformation,"“india yet taken full advantage digital revolution. ” picture

2016-05-22,investors who turned their back are coming back: nitin gadkari,"new delhi, 19/05/2016: minister for road transport and highways and shipping, nitin gadkari during an interaction with the hindu at his residence, in new delhi on thursday. photo: v. sudershan. | photo credit: v_sudershan , union road transport, highways and shipping minister nitin gadkari is confident of pushing through rs 25 lakh crore of investments in the critical transport sectors under his watch over the nda government's tenure. while private sector developers who had abandoned highway projects in 2014 are now coming back into the fray, the minister said the biggest challenge he faces is not financing, land acquisition or environmental clearances, but slow decision making processes in the administration. edited excerpts from an interview with the hindu's somesh jha and vikas dhoot:, two years after taking charge, do you feel india's economy is out of the woods yet?, look, when we came to power, the gdp (gross domestic product) growth stood at 4.25 per cent, now it has gone up to 7.5 per cent. there was a shortage of coal – we have a surplus coal after two years and similar is the case with the power generation. we can’t also say that everything is sailing smoothly, but the train that got derailed during upa regime is back on track. talking about infrastructure, road was built up at the speed of 2 km per day earlier. now, it stands at the highest ever pace of 25 km per day. in our sector, after completion of two years, i have commissioned work worth rs 2.5 lakh crore. for the first time in history, the profits of 12 major ports and three flagship organisations – cochin shipyard, shipping corporation of india, dredging corporation of india – more than rs 6,000 crore. in the port sector, it is for the first time that our efficiency compared to the private players is better. while one of the largest private port's efficiency declined 1.6 per cent, ours rose by 2.46 per cent. there is improvement in ports, inland waterways sector has opened up and work worth rs 4,000 crore has been initiated inganga. there were landmark decisions in the automobile sector –euro vi emission norms will set in by 1 april 2020. we have launched ethanol, bio-diesel, cng and electric buses and encouraging its use. these are import-substitute, cost-effective and pollution-free. talking about irrigation, there were around 89 projects valued at rs 1.5 lakh crore under aibp (accelerated irrigation benefits) which were dead assets. we will spend rs 80,000 crorein four years to complete these aibp projects. for the first time, rs 20,000 crore per year has been budgeted for pradhan mantri krishi sinchai yojana which will assist states. there were 3.60 lakh bank accounts earlier and today, 21.7 lakh crore accounts have been opened. the petroleum gas subsidy savings has helped 5 crore people to get gas cylinders. the health and insurance schemes for the poor has been a success. we have had a positive approach in development programmes for all the strata -- villagers, poor, labour and farmers. there was an indecisive government (earlier) but now we have a government with a vision for development. our relations have improved with neighbouring countries. we are making roads connectivity to bangladesh, nepal, bhutan, mynamar andbangkok. earlier, it used to take 18 hours to travel via road from agartala to kolkata but now it’s possible to travel from agartala to kolkata via dhaka. in all the countries that prime minister narendra modi has visited – be it theunited states, russia, australia, uk or dubai our prestige and respect has gone up. we have tried to build good relations with pakistan. we have been able to control naxalite movement and due to state support, we have successfully kept a check on cross-border terrorism. i think, overall, on all the fronts there has been good work., people have more expectations from us and it will take us some more time to fulfill those. it took 60 years for the congress here we have only completed two years and not all expectations can be met in two years but i can confidently say that the work that has not happened in last 60 years, we will make it happen in five years., what about road links to pakistan?, the prime minister himself visited pakistan and extended his hand for friendship. till the time pakistan stops sponsoring cross-border terrorism and doesn’t keep a check on terrorist and terrorist organisation coming into india, there can’t be good relations. pakistan too is suffering from poverty and malnutrition and i feel at this point, we all should joins hands in fighting these issues and move towards development. we have good relations with bangladesh and we will do our best to maintain good terms with nepal. we are good with bhutan. everywhere we are putting our efforts to maintain good affairs., the atal bihari vajpayee-led nda government had launched the golden quadrilateral project of four-laned national highways connecting all metros. at the time, it was said to be one of the most ambitious national projects embarked upon, since sher shah suri's times. what's the big plan for infrastructure in this government?, in our country, the road length is 52 lakh kilometres but out of this, only 96,000 km is the national highways network. at present, 40 per cent of the entire traffic commutes on this two per cent road. this has caused five lakh accidents, three lakh injuries and 1.5 lakh people dying on road (every year). now, we have decided to increase the national highways network to 2 lakh km from 96,000 km. we have already declared 1.55 lakh km of roads and when the highways network will expand to 2 lakh km, 80 per cent of the country’s traffic will ply on it. earlier, four-laning of roads was done when traffic volume was more than 25,000 pcus (passenger car units per day) which has been decreased to 10,000 pcus. we have taken two historic steps. one per cent of the cost of construction (of roads) will go into plantation, beautification and maintenance and one per cent on road safety. so, rs 5,000 each will be spent on this in the next four years. we will come up with 1,300 road side amenities and the tender for 60 is already out. we have identified 300 spots for parking plaza, hotels, motels, restaurants, petrol pump, service centres, handloom stores, fruit and vegetable shops, helipad and a small hospital for treatment of the locals. it will boost employment., we will open logistics park on the easterly and westerly bypass road so that godowns are located outside delhi. i have also told (delhi chief minister arvind) kejriwal if all the godowns can be located outside delhi, it will reduce the traffic and pollution here. we are building 14-lane delhi-meerut expressway. so, we are building roadways, expressways, highways in the entire country and i think this will create huge jobs. usually, investments worth rs 1 crore give employment to 70 people. i will complete rs 2.5 lakh crore investments by 26 may, and i will give you the list of the projects, you can calculate the jobs that it will create with that scale of investment. the country needs a policy that generates employment and without infrastructure, both industry and agriculture cannot prosper and the gdp will not grow. i have kept american president john kennedy’s quote in my office which says, ‘american roads are not good because america is rich but america is rich because american roads are good.’ so, prosperity comes with roads., but our first priority is waterways, followed by railways and roads. in china, 45 per cent of the passengers and goods travel through waterways, similarly in japan and korea it is 43-44 per cent, in european countries it is more than 40 per cent but here it stands at only 3.5 per cent. if you go by waterways, you spend 20 paisa (on logistics), through railways rs 1 and by road you spend rs 1.5. that’s why we have decided to convert 111 rivers into national waterways. we have 7,500 km coastline and we are building six new ports out of which work on three new ports will commence this year., you claim that the ministry doesn’t lack funds but private sector interest has been lukewarm and the the finance ministry is facing burden from the seventh pay commission..., please understand my economic model. the budget for the road sector is rs 55,000 crore. then, our income from toll collection is rs 10,000 crore. if i securitise my toll income for 15 years, i will get rs 130,000 crore which leaves us with around rs 2 lakh crore. if i securitise the government’s funds that went into completion of 111 projects, i will get 1 lakh crore. this makes it rs 3 lakh crore in total. apart from this, the government has given us approval to raise rs 70,000 crore tax-exempted bonds, so that becomes rs 4 lakh crore. then, if i build more roads from this fund, i will get more toll collection. so, out of my target of completing work worth rs 25 lakh crore, i will spend rs 10-12 lakh crore in roads and rs 15-20 lakh crore in shipping., can you elaborate on the securitisation aspect?, the pension funds and insurance funds are ready to take my funds. i will go into tripartite agreement and tell them we will give six per cent returns. that’s not an issue. the budget provision for shipping sector has been only rs 1,800 crore. i have made a profit of rs 6,000 crore last year. next year, it will go up to rs 8,000 crore and then 10,000 crore. so in four years, i will have profit worth rs 40,000 crore. then, i have fixed deposits worth rs 15,000 crore in banks. this means a total of rs 55,000 crore add to that rs 10,000 from creditors so it comes out to be rs 65,000 crore. i have a turnover of rs 4,000 crore in ports and shipping in dollar terms. now, for eight-laning concrete road project from jnpt to panvel, i took loans in dollar terms at the rate of 2.75 per cent, instead of the borrowing rate of 12 per cent that i took in other projects. so, i took a loan of rs 3,000 crore at 2.75 per cent. so on this rs 4,000 crore (forex-based) turnover, i will take loans worth rs 50,000 crore at 2.75 per cent in dollar terms. so, i have funds worth rs 1 lakh crore. then, i will get returns on these projects too., you are talking of external commercial borrowings (ecbs)?, no, it is not ecb. recently, i took loan from banks for the eight-lane panvel project in dollar terms instead of rupees. so, i have rs 50,000 crore. i am not dependent on the finance ministry for budget. i am spending rs 4 lakh crore in ports – rs 1 lakh towards port rail connectivity, rs 2 lakh for port road connectivity and rs 1 lakh crore on mechanisation and modernisation of ports. i will spend rs 8 lakh crore towards 27 industrial clusters barring the investments on inland waterways and smart cities. so, i have targeted spending rs 25 lakh crore whereas the actual work is worth around rs 30 lakh crore. i am not amongst those ministers who make shallow promises. i say what i mean and i mean it., what are the kinds of problems you have faced in executing the projects?, my problem is not related to land acquisition and environment clearance. my problem is addressing the decision-making process in administration. we have taken 21 cabinet decisions and a lot of committees have been set up. the decision in such committees takes months to complete. i want to fasten this process. that is my responsibility and i don’t blame anyone for that. you go to any contractor and they will say we have saved them. when i became the highways minister, 403 projects worth rs 3.85 lakh crore were stalled and today, only 14-15 projects worth rs 30,000 crore are languishing and the problems related to the rest are solved. had i not addressed those issues, the banks’ npas (non-performing assets) would have shot up to rs 3 lakh crore. i have saved the bankers and the industrialists from this trap. i held thousands of meetings with contractors and bankers. so i called all the stakeholders and solved the big issues. so, a positive approach, transparent system, time-bound approach, team spirit and development-oriented system are the strengths of our management., out of the stalled projects, how many did you have to terminate?, we have terminated 43 projects out of 403 projects. we have issued fresh tenders and work on many of these has already begun. four such projects have started on the hybrid annuity model too., what about the expressways?, this year, we will begin work on the vadodara-mumbai expressway. the highway alignment on delhi-jaipur is almost complete and similar is the case with delhi-katra expressway. we have planned delhi-meerut, bangalore-chennai, hyderabad- bangalore and vijaywada-bangalore projects., how will the land packaging work in such projects? the developers have demanded the land access along the highways in the past…, there are three successful models of land acquisition in the country – one is in amravati, another in surat and third is navi mumbai airport. the model is that we will acquire land and return 40 per cent of the land to the owner after development, 20 per cent will go into building infrastructure and the rest 40 per cent we will take. the cost of land will decrease with this model. now, let’s say we build a logistics park on a 1,000 acre land. we will give 400 acre land to the land owner, nhai will get 400 acre land and the rest 20 per cent land can go into building petrol pump or road side amenities so a new township will be created in the form of logistic park. this innovate model will help farmers, create employment and lead to development., what is the response you have got on the hybrid annuity model for highways?, when i became the minister, the ppp (public-private) model was not getting any response. already 17 projects have been commissioned on the hybrid annuity model. the response on the build operate transfer (bot) toll model was tepid as the market situation was not good. i will tell you an instance. larsen & tourbo (l&t) chairman am naik came to me and said his company’s board has taken a decision to not do any road projects and he decided to exit the road projects taking a penalty of 1.5 per cent. now, l&t is doing nine projects worth rs 15,000 crore. so, the situation has changed and investors who had exited are coming back., your ministry is also planning to develop roads through the swiss challenge model. but dr. vijay kelkar panel had criticised the model recently in its report., we have drafted a cabinet note and if the government permits us, we will go ahead. but i feel the swiss challenge model is not required in the road sector. we don’t have technology and resources and land problems., and you will acquire the land for developers?, we have made it a rule that without acquiring 80 per cent of the land, we will not give work orders or permits., but you said decision making in the administration is an issue…, file is pending for months with various committees. that’s the biggest challenge for us. although we have succeeded to a very large extent, but more work needs to be done., what about the chabahar port you were supposed to develop in iran?, the prime minister is going to iran on may 23 and i may also accompany him and finalise the agreement., what will be the model?, we have formed a global company and kandla port and jnpt (jawaharlal nehru port) has claimed equity in it and we will build the port., so, iran will also have stakes in it?, we will develop the port and return it to iran in some years., there were npa issues with banks. how do you plan to get their support?, the banks are not giving loans and financial closure is taking years. banks are scared of giving loans looking at pending cases with cbi and cvc and also because of the media. i have told this to the finance minister. i plan to set up an infrastructure finance corporation on the lines of the power trading corporation. we have floated a cabinet note. we plan to bring foreign funds., what is the timeline to double the national highways?, within three months. at present, we have completed 1.55 lakh kilometres and till the next parliament session, we will achieve that target., what was the response of the delhi government on the logistics park proposed by you to ease congestion and pollution in the capital?, the delhi government is very much receptive. i extend help to everyone -- all congress chief ministers or whether it is kejriwalji or lalu (prasad)ji. i don't do politics in my work., there were a lot of issues related to the diesel cars…, in delhi, there are 18-20,000 diesel taxis. the supreme court had put a ban on them. we requested the court that we respect your judgement and we will not give diesel permits going ahead and try to convert diesel vehicles into cng., don’t you think diesel recently got unfairly demonised campaign?, look, there is no denying that diesel causes pollution. that’s why ethanol, bio-diesel and bio-cng are the future. fifty buses in nagpur run on ethanol provided by us. we made a royalty of rs 18 crore from mahrashtra government by selling toilet water and 100 buses are running from the bio-cng produced from it. it is a import substitute, cost effective and pollution-free model. if you go for innovation, entrepreneurship, technology, research and digital india, then sky is the limit., five indian cars recently failed the global ncap safety test…, along with safety, we also need to take the cost of vehicles into account. we are trying to align with the western country standards but we also need to look at the paying capacity of our citizens. we will look at the report and will take decisions through an integrated approach. but if we conform to those standards, the cost of vehicle can go up by 15 per cent and if that happens, it will hit the affordability of the people., even after two years of the government, industry sometimes feels that they are unable to see the progress on ground…",0.13669845353807622,investors turned

2016-05-26,team india is at work,"outreach: “empowerment of individuals is a running theme of the last two years.” picture shows the prime minister at a mass yoga programme on international yoga day, in new delhi in 2015. — photo: shanker chakravarty | photo credit: shanker chakravarty , the sheer force of the aspirations of >young india led narendra modi from gandhinagar to delhi in may 2014. india, in its hour of deep crisis, found its man of the moment in mr. modi. after two years of that historic verdict, the pertinent question to ask is if the modi-led government is walking the talk., the bharatiya janata party’s strong foray into the northeast by >winning assam is a part of the narrative that had begun to unfold in 2014. it is a reassertion of the confidence of aspiring india in prime minister modi. bihar and delhi were the exceptions to this general rule., many a milestone the major outcome of the last two years has been that india has begun to regroup with a new sense of purpose and a programme of action breaking away from a sense of despair., the aspirations of individual citizens and of india as a collective are closely intertwined in the globalised world. to help people fulfil their aspirations, india needs to be pushed to newer horizons in the intricate global order by playing to its strengths. this is where mr. modi has done a great deal. the world now takes india more seriously than ever before. while the leading economic powers look at india’s market potential, mr. modi is clever enough to turn it to our advantage. >‘make in india’ is one such example., according highest priority to restoring india’s image internationally, the prime minister struck a personal equation with u.s. president barack obama, u.k. prime minister david cameron and other world leaders, while his >unscheduled stopover at lahore to greet pakistan prime minister nawaz sharif on his birthday clearly showed his innovative approach on the foreign policy front., a few other milestones relating to foreign policy include the successful evacuation of more than 18,000 people, mostly indians, from crisis-hit countries like iraq and yemen, the declaration of >international yoga day by the un and the landmark india-bangladesh land boundary agreement for exchange of 162 adversely-held enclaves. on formulation and implementation of foreign policy, everyone admits that mr. modi has scored high., the aim of the prime minister is to make india a developed nation while bringing about a complete transformation in the lives of the people through good governance, development and pro-poor, pro-farmer and pro-women policies. while mr. modi came out with many trendsetting schemes, one of the most revolutionary welfare measures has been the flagship> jan-dhan yojana, which seeks to achieve financial inclusion., unleashing india’s potential empowerment of individuals is a running theme of the last two years. skill india, promotion of entrepreneurship through mudra (micro units development and refinance agency) bank and >startup india bear this out. the results of this approach will be more in evidence soon. several other pioneering initiatives like make in india, skill india and digital india are set to boost the manufacturing and entrepreneurial talent in the country and transform the country into a nation of job creators as envisaged by the prime minister., even as developed economies have strong social security networks, more needy indians do not have them. mr. modi is keen to address this gap by creating a secured and pensioned society, the need of the hour. several schemes have been rolled out which have met with considerable success already. financial inclusion through jan-dhan and >aadhaar-linked subsidy payments are meant to benefit more and more poor., it is a settled issue by now that increased opportunities for the aspiring come only through rapid economic growth. despite adverse global economic conditions, india is being held as the ray of hope. this has been made possible through effective macroeconomic and >inflation management. foreign direct investment is on a steady rise, manufacturing and core industrial production are showing positive signs. specific attention is being paid to critical social sectors, infrastructure, agriculture and rural development, micro, small and medium enterprises, food processing, etc. this is a part of multi-pronged and balanced strategy for overall development., above all, corruption rollback is the most spectacular accomplishment under mr. modi’s leadership. delhi’s power corridors are surprised as to how this is possible so quickly. it is the prime minister’s way of keeping his promise to the people in 2014. the buzzing traffic of brokers, dealmakers and middlemen in sarkari buildings is now a thing of the past., politics is integral to democracy. but negative politics with the sole aim of derailing the government’s agenda has been attempted. campaigns of so-called growing intolerance, polarisation, etc., could only find some media space before petering out. after bouts of obstruction, parliament has now come to find a new equilibrium. so-called contentious issues are being raised with force that the opposition could muster, but bills are being passed. >the real estate (regulation and development) bill was finally passed unanimously under public pressure. something similar will happen with the goods and services tax bill too. after all, mr. modi represents the will of the people, and he has their mandate., for india’s transformation, urban transformation is the key as more and more people migrate to cities and towns, which drive the economy. under the prime minister’s leadership, a quiet transformation is taking place at the level of urban local bodies and states for scripting a new urban india. smart cities mission, atal mission for rejuvenation and urban transformation, >pradhan mantri awas yojana (urban) have been launched as vehicles of inclusive, integrated and holistic urban development. a new sense of vigour and enthusiasm is now being shown at the level of municipalities with a sense of competition to do better than the others., team india is at work. states now have greater say in addressing larger issues and implementation of policies and programmes. they now feel like real partners in working the federal

sisters in the country and abroad., 2. as we celebrate our seventieth independence day, i respectfully bow to the heroes of our independence struggle - known and unknown - who fought, suffered and sacrificed their lives to win freedom for us. mahatma gandhi’s luminous leadership finally made the british quit india in 1947. when we gained independence in 1947, nobody believed that india will survive as a democracy. yet, seven decades later, one and a quarter billion indians with all their diversity have proved those forecasts wrong. the strong edifice of democracy built by our founding fathers on the four pillars of justice, liberty, equality and fraternity has withstood several threats from both within and without and has grown from strength to strength., fellow citizens:, 3. this is for the fifth time that i speak to you on the eve of independence day. in the past four years, i have seen with some satisfaction a stable and progressive democracy in full play with peaceful transfer of power from one party to another, from one government to another, and from one generation to another. notwithstanding the different hues of political thought, i have seen the ruling party and the opposition coming together in pursuit of national agenda of development, unity, integrity and security of the nation. in the just-concluded session of parliament, the passage of the constitution amendment bill for the introduction of gst amidst non-partisan and quality parliamentary deliberations is reason enough to celebrate our democratic maturity., 4. in these four years, i also saw with, some disquiet, forces of divisiveness and intolerance trying to raise their ugly head. attacks on weaker sections that militate against our national ethos are aberrations that need to be dealt with firmly. the collective wisdom of our society and our polity gives me the confidence that such forces will remain marginalized and india’s remarkable growth story will continue uninterrupted., 5. the safety and security that we provide to our women and children determines the well-being of the state and society. every incident of violence against a woman or a child inflicts a wound on the soul of the civilization. we cannot call ourselves a civilized society if we fail in this duty., fellow citizens:, 6. democracy is more than a periodic exercise of choices to elect the government. the great tree of liberty requires constant nourishment through the institutions of democracy. disruptions, obstructionism and un-mindful pursuit of a divisive political agenda by groups and individuals lead to nothing but institutional travesty and constitutional subversion. polarizing debates only deepen the fault lines in public discourse., 7. our constitution is not only a political or legal document but also an emotional, cultural and social contract. my distinguished predecessor dr. sarvepalli radhakrishnan had said on the eve of independence day fifty years ago and i quote: ""we have adopted a democratic constitution. it helps us to maintain our individuality in the face of mounting pressures for standardized thinking and acting…….. democratic assemblies serve as safety valves for social tensions and prevent dangerous explosions. in an effective democracy, its members should be willing to accept law and lawful authority. no man, no group can be his or its own law giver” (unquote)., 8. the constitution has clearly defined the duties and responsibilities of every organ of the state. it has established the ancient indian ethos of ""maryada” as far as authorities and institutions of state power are concerned. the spirit of the constitution has to be upheld by adherence to this ""maryada” by the functionaries in the discharge of their duties., fellow citizens:, 9. one unique feature that has held india together is our respect for each other’s cultures, values and beliefs. the very essence of plurality lies in cherishing our heterogeneity and valuing our diversity. in the networked environment of today, a caring society can only be developed by harmonizing religion with modern science. swami vivekananda had once observed and i quote: ""what is needed is a fellow-feeling between the different types of religion, seeing that they all stand or fall together, a fellow-feeling which springs from mutual respect, and not the condescending, patronizing, niggardly expression of goodwill” (unquote)., 10. it is true, as was pointed out in a famous speech made on this very day 69 years ago by pandit nehru that in a nation’s history, moments come when we step out from the old to the new, when the soul of a nation finds utterance. but it is also important to realize that such moments are not strokes of luck that come upon us by surprise. a nation can and must strive to create such a moment. we must take destiny in our own hands to build the indiaof our dreams. backed by strong political will, we have to create a future which will economically empower six hundred million youth, build a digital india, a start-up india, and a skilled india. as we build an indiaof hundreds of smart cities, towns and villages, we must ensure that they are humane, hi-tech and happy places leading to the creation of a technology-driven but compassionate society. we should promote and reinforce a scientific temper by questioning our beliefs which are not compatible with scientific way of thinking. we must learn to challenge the status quo and refuse to accept inefficiency and slipshod work. in a competitive environment, a sense of immediacy and some impatience is a necessary virtue., fellow citizens:, 11. india will grow, only when all of india grows. the excluded ones have to be included in the development process. the hurt and the alienated have to be brought back into the mainstream. in this age of technological advance, machines are being pitted against men. the only way to survive this is to acquire knowledge and skills, and learn to innovate. inclusive innovations linked to the aspirations of our people can benefit a wide spectrum of society as well as preserve our diversity. we as a nation must nurture creativity, science and technology. here, our schools and institutions of higher learning have a special responsibility., 12. we often celebrate the achievements of our ancient past but it would be wrong to rest on our laurels. it is much more important to look to the future. it is time to join hands to cooperate, innovate and advance. india has had remarkable growth in recent times, often growing above eight percent per annum over the last decade. international agencies have acknowledged india’s status as the fastest growing major economy in the world and recognized major improvements in indices of ease of doing business and logistics performance. the start-up movement and the innovative spirit of our young entrepreneurs have also attracted international attention. we must build on our strengths so that, this lead can be sustained and furthered. a normal monsoon this year gives us reason to cheer, unlike the past two years when below normal rains created agrarian distress. the fact that despite two consecutive drought years, inflation has remained below 6 percent and agricultural output has been stable, is a testimony to our nation’s resilience, and to how far we have progressed since independence., fellow citizens:, 13. our foreign policy has shown considerable dynamism in recent times. we have reinvigorated our historic bonds of friendship with traditional partners of africa and asia pacific. we are in the process of forging new relationships based on shared values and mutual benefit with all countries, especially our immediate and extended neighbourhood. there will be no stepping back on our ""neighbourhood first policy”. close bonds of history, culture, civilization and geography provide the people of south asia with an extraordinary opportunity to carve out a common destiny and to march together towards prosperity. this opportunity must be seized without delay. india’s focus in foreign policy will remain on peaceful co-existence and harnessing technology and resources for its economic development. recent initiatives have enhanced energy security, promoted food security, and created international partnerships to take our flagship development programmes forward., 14. the world has witnessed a spate of terror activities having their roots in radicalization of people on the basis of religion. these forces apart from killing innocent people in the name of religion also threaten to disturb geopolitical divides, which could prove disastrous for world peace. the inhuman, mindless and barbaric modus operandi of such groups have been visible in france, belgium, united states, nigeria, kenya and closer home in afghanistan and bangladesh recently. these forces now pose a danger to the entire comity of nations. the world will have to fight them unconditionally and in one voice., fellow citizens:, 15. for all the challenges that we see in front of ourselves i have a great belief in our innate and inherent capacity as an ancient country whose soul andjijivisha-the will to live and excel can never be suppressed. various forces external as well as internal have tried to smother this soul of india over millennia but every time this soul has emerged more powerful and more glorious having neutralized, assimilated and incorporated every challenge that it faced., 16.indiathrough its unique civilizational contribution has repeatedly conveyed the message of peace and harmony to the trouble-torn world. in 1970, historian arnold toynbee had the following to say about india’s role in contemporary history. i quote: ""today, we are still living in this transitional chapter of the world’s history, but it is already becoming clear that a chapter which had a western beginning, will have to have an indian ending, if it is not to end in the self-destruction of the human race” (unquote). toynbee further went on to say that at the cross roads of human history, the only way of salvation of mankind is the indian way., fellow citizens:, 17. on this occasion, i convey my special greetings and gratitude to the members of our armed forces, paramilitary and internal security forces who are at the forefront of guarding and preserving the unity, integrity and security of our motherland., 18. in the end, i would once again invoke the upanishads as i had invoked in my first address on the eve of independence day four years ago. for this invocation shall live forever, as will mother india:, ""may god protect us;, may god nourish us;, may we work together with vigour and energy;",0.1245133763119375,president ’ address eve 70th independence day,"fellow citizens : , 1. eve sixty-ninth anniversary independence , extend warm greetings brothers sisters country abroad. , 2.

2016-09-07,the public face of a private company,"“what’s in a name,” asked shakespeare. plenty, it appears. the use of the prime minister’s name and image in advertisements by a private telecom company, as part of the roll-out of their (arguably) industry-altering telecommunication services, has caused much controversy. social media was abuzz on that day, with many questioning the propriety of a constitutional authority endorsing a private commercial venture. however, for the moment, keeping aside this question of propriety, the telecom company’s use of the prime minister’s name and image, to advertise the launch of its flagship service, raises an interesting legal question., the emblems and names (prevention of improper use) act, 1950, was enacted to “prevent the improper use of certain emblems and names for professional and commercial purposes”. the motivations behind the enactment were twofold. first, pursuant to the resolutions of the united nations general assembly and the world health assembly, member states were required to take necessary legislative measures to prevent the use, without authorisation, and in particular for commercial purposes, of the emblem, official seal and name of the united nations and/or the world health organisation, within their country. second, instances had come to light of the use of the indian national flag and emblem, and of the names and pictorial representations of mahatma gandhi and other national leaders, for commercial and trade purposes, and in a manner likely to offend the sentiments of the people. the act accordingly sought to proscribe the “…use, for the purpose of any trade, business, calling or profession... any name or emblem specified in the schedule or any colorable imitation thereof, without the previous permission of the central government or of such officer of government authorized in this behalf…”. the central government was empowered under the act to alter or amend this schedule, by notification in the official gazette. in keeping with the motivations behind the enactment, originally the schedule to the act specified only three items, namely, the name, emblem and official seal of the un and of the who; and the indian flag. however, in the course of several years, the central government through notifications added other items to the schedule, including, significantly, “the name and pictorial representation of the prime minister of india, whilst specifically carving out an exception for the pictorial use thereof on calendars, provided the calendar was not used for advertising goods.”, the question which therefore arises is whether the advertisements by using the name and image of the prime minister, fall foul of the provisions of the act. at the very outset, to attract the proscription, the use of the name and image of the prime minister has to be for the purpose of trade or business. the advertisements in question are very craftily worded to suggest that the launch of the telecom services is dedicated to the prime minister’s stated vision of a digital india, and therefore the use of his name and image have to be understood in connection therewith. however, as would be obvious to a neutral observer, the company through the advertisement cleverly appropriates the prime minister’s name and image to further its own business interest, and therefore is likely to fall within the mischief the enactment seeks to prevent. ultimately, therefore, the question of legality would turn on whether the company secured prior approval of the central government before using the prime minister’s name and image in the advertisement. however, there appears to be no formal clarification in this respect from either party.",0.0777989417989418,public face private company,"“what ’ name , ” asked shakespeare. plenty , appears. use prime minister ’ name image advertisements private telecom company , part roll-out ( arguably ) industry-altering telecommunication services , caused much controversy. social media abuzz day , many questioning propriety constitutional authority endorsing private commercial venture. however , moment , keeping aside question propriety , telecom company ’ use prime minister ’ name image , advertise launch flagship service , raises interesting legal question. , emblems names ( prevention improper use ) act , 1950 , enacted “prevent improper use certain emblems names professional commercial purposes ” . motivations behind enactment twofold. first , pursuant resolutions united nations general assembly world health assembly , member states required take necessary legislative measures prevent use , without authorisation , particular commercial purposes , emblem , official seal name united nations and/or world health organisation , within country. second , instances come light use indian national flag emblem , names pictorial representations mahatma gandhi national leaders , commercial trade purposes , manner likely offend sentiments people. act accordingly sought proscribe “ … use , purpose trade , business , calling profession ... name emblem specified schedule colorable imitation thereof , without previous permission central government officer government authorized behalf … ” . central government empowered act alter amend schedule , notification official gazette. keeping motivations behind enactment , originally schedule act specified three items , namely , name , emblem official seal un ;

2017-01-22,putting the e in empower,"in 2014, a study on internet penetration in resource-poor neighbourhoods — covering dharavi, girgaum and gazdhar bandh — by partners for urban knowledge, action & research (pukar) yielded some interesting findings. in the poorest neighbourhood, gazdhar bandh in santacruz, 95% of 1,377 people surveyed said it was the municipal corporation of greater mumbai’s responsibility to provide affordable internet. though at least 43% did not own smartphones, 584 people in the 14–30 year age group, 42% of the total, knew how to use the internet., a year later, the centre launched digital india; it’s aim: digital empowerment by creating digital infrastructure, delivering services digitally, and increasing digital literacy. more recently, in maharashtra, chief minister devendra fadnavis announced one of the biggest public wifi projects in the world: 500 hotspots in mumbai went live on january 9., but for the residents of gazdhar bandh — and many others across one of india’s best-connected cities — not much has changed on the ground. “the free wifi zones announcement is humbug,” says dr. anita patil-deshmukh, executive director, pukar. the reason, she says, is because there is a huge gap between the number of users and available facilities., setting up of wifi spots is a good starting point, says abhay karandikar, professor at the department of electrical engineering at iit bombay, but what has to be built into the plan is a sustainable service and connectivity model. the state government must consider that mumbai is densely packed, more so than many other global cities. “we will probably need several hundreds, even thousands, of hotspots.”, infrastructure issues, “how can you think of digital india,” dr. patil-deshmukh asks, “when your basic infrastructure is simply not made available to people in resource-poor neighbourhoods?” she cites kaula bunder in fort, where pukar has been working for nearly a decade. because the colony, which came up during the british raj, is on bombay port trust land, it has no electricity; those who do have power survive on stolen connections. “there are no mobile towers here, so forget about network. we have the same issue in a mankhurd slum where we are working. in our office in kherwadi, bandra east, email is very slow. we are 10 minutes away from bandra-kurla complex and this is the country’s financial capital. how do we deal with these huge gaps?” many places in the city are so dense that gps doesn’t work there. if google and insat cannot map these areas, she asks, how can you think of including them in a plan for the city? “when there’s no water, where is the space for fibre optics?”, • “right to internet is soon going to be seen as a basic right, given the number of services and opportunities moving online,” prof. karandikar says, but it is not sustainable for the government to set up hundreds of wifi spots. the government needs to look at sustainable connectivity, perhaps through a public-private partnership model, both in terms of funding and maintenance., • to some extent, the problem can be addressed by installing multiple small mobile towers and paying people whose homes are used as bases. “people in slums will love that arrangement.” dr. patil-deshmukh says, “because they need the money.”, the basics, a digital communications network depends on the availability, accessibility and affordability of broadband — high-speed internet access — via fibre-optic lines that carries large volumes of digital information faster than cable, dsl or 3g/4g., by some estimates, 58% of india’s internet users are in urban areas; most use it via mobile phones, with only 13% of households using broadband. “high costs of access, irrelevant online content/services, low digital literacy and low internet speeds, all continue to plague usage and impact the potential to scale up,” says pankaj joshi, executive director, urban design research institute (udri). “there is a large population of potential users from low-income neighbourhoods and marginalised communities who remain unconnected and excluded by service providers, resulting in a digital divide. understanding land-use requirements for physical installation of these networks is a key step to provide opportunities for them. scaling up will require sufficient investments in digital communication infrastructure especially in informal neighbourhoods, where costs need to be subsidised.”, • the urban design research institute, pukar and majlis have advocated broadband planning through the development plan. the ‘sab ke liye broadband’ campaign calls for the municipal corporation to be the planning and monitoring agency responsible for deploying broadband infrastructure, and for the private sector to be engaged in laying down last-mile connectivity. “for the mcgm, the investment has the potential to become a source of revenue,” mr. joshi says. “a private vendor will need to pay to use their fibre-to-the-kerb in order to provide last-mile connectivity.”, • for areas where infrastructure cannot be laid due to high densities or right-of-way issues, mr. joshi says, the mcgm can invest in creating public wifi spots in some of the 11,000 mcgm-owned properties like schools, hospitals, and ward offices., global best practices, “a clear strategy must also be in place to enable online services that have meaning for citizens,” mr. joshi says. “the existing land use of the mumbai development plan 2034 shows severe shortages in amenities such as educational and health facilities. bringing some of these services online can reach more people faster without requiring changes in land use or huge investments, besides creating government transparency and accountability towards citizens.” udri’s login mumbai — a site with a map overlaid with data related to population, health, education, transportation, governance and other planning parameters — gives citizens important but complex public information through easy-to-comprehend visuals to help them understand implications on their communities. “it will also serve a purpose in clarifying data and the veracity of its source, enabling a first step in citizen participation.”, across the world, cities are now recognising that greater investments need to be made to connect those who cannot afford it, and investing in municipal broadband., chattanooga, in tennessee, usa, was one of the first; in 2010, its electric power board utility launched a 1 gigabit per second municipal network. since then, the city has attracted not just startups and entrepreneurs, but also other businesses relocating in or expanding to the area. in 2016, new york proposed the new ny broadband program, a public-private partnership focussing on underserved areas. it will look for vendors to set up the infrastructure and will provide matching funds for installation., • cities must also simplify permissions and remove potential barriers for infrastructure providers. seattle, for instance, has reduced regulatory barriers to attract broadband fibre investments and encouraged public-private partnerships., true inclusion, as much as increasing internet access, digital inclusion is about policies that enable and benefit citizens., “mumbai in one sense has a big outreach,” says ravina aggarwal, director, columbia global centers, mumbai. “but is it affordable, reliable, efficient and open?” the discourse tends to be about technology, and not whether the state cares about the economically disadvantaged, she says. “it also depends on affordability and how competitive they are. how can the internet be easily accessed in different places? somebody who can afford high speed at home has a different ability to be included in the digital world than somebody who’s on a slow, municipal speed.”, “our national broadband policy, our telecom policy, they have universal service provisions as a goal,” ms. aggarwal says. for service providers, these are preconditions to get spectrum. the challenge is that providers are often afflicted with the ‘winner’s curse’: they have paid so much for licences they don’t have money for the infrastructure, so sit on their spectrum, “blocking it but not actually providing infrastructure to people they can’t recover it from.”, for government services much depends, prof. karandikar says, on the quality of the experience: ease of access, usable interfaces, quick response times. this needs both wifi connectivity as well as a robust back-end to ensure that services run smoothly., the other challenge with mumbai, he says, is that though many are familiar with the use of technology, a large section of the population has to be educated in the use of digital services. “simple transactions, like those that are being proposed through aadhaar, don’t require a high level of digital literacy. but their success will depend on whether connectivity can be established on a large scale.” for more complex transactions, online banking for instance, some level of digital education is still necessary., an essential component, dr. patil-deshmukh says, is financial and related aspects of inclusion: one should get easy access to government schemes, admissions and so on, on the internet, “without having to make 60 trips to the university or bmc office.” the second aspect is service delivery: the availability of water, healthcare and sanitation facilities. “these are fundamental; we’re not even getting into fancy stuff.”, • to enable last-mile delivery, dr. patil-deshmukh says, the government can look at subsidies to poorer sections of society., participation follows trust, “if knowledge is power,” mr. joshi says, “then providing universal access is essential to a working democracy.” this includes, he says, essential services like mobile banking, school and college admissions, tele-medicine, as well as e-governance and co-ordination during disasters., it is also necessary to create a better space for education, ms. aggarwal says, not just in the formal system, but also in building understanding of ways one can be creative in the digital space. “rather than getting messages top-down, how do you creatively use it? how can i be a discerning consumer and a producer?” this means citizens must be made comfortable with technology, unafraid of it., dr. patil-deshmukh says it’s about empowering people with knowledge and how they can leverage it as voters, especially with corporators and ward officers. “the younger generation can understand this better. they are more into development, and we’ve seen this in our younger members of parliament.” she says this will also break the back of the ‘mafia’ that corporators have become by bringing in transparency., india has one of the world’s more censored digital environments. “if you are participating, how free are you to participate?” ms. aggarwal asks. “how do we create a more accepting environment for diverse views, and how do you trust this medium where you are putting out all your information? that’s a concern.” the digital space we create will determine if we progress as an open society, tolerating diverse views. “otherwise we will continue to perpetuate proprietary kinds of knowledge.”, it’s also critical, ms. aggarwal says, to acknowledge that technology can be pervasive and intrusive, that it can force you to interact with it ways you don’t like. “that becomes a culture and you can’t step away from it. can we incentivise and create other public modes of exchange?” particularly for the poor, “identity, whether it’s through aadhar or the cashless economy, is already written into the digital world. it’s not a choice, it’s a responsibility to help people understand and navigate this space.”, broadband in policies, • broadband was recognised as key to development in may 2010, when the international telecommunication union and unesco set up the broadband commission for digital development as part of efforts to meet the millennium development goals. expanding broadband access in every country is vital to accelerating progress towards these goals by 2015, it said, seeking commitments from all member countries to effect such plans., • in india, the need for universal access to broadband infrastructure was first recognised in the national broadband policy of 2004 that set the targets for broadband penetration in rural and urban areas.",0.10936769909984198,putting e empower,"2014 , study internet penetration resource-poor neighbourhoods — covering dharavi , girgaum gazdhar bandh — partners urban knowledge , action &amp;

supreme sacrifice of their lives in defending india’s territorial integrity and maintaining law and order., , brothers and sisters:, 2.when india attained freedom on 15th august 1947, we did not have an instrument of governance of our own. we waited till 26th january, 1950 when the indian people gave to themselves a constitution to secure for all its citizens, justice, liberty, equality, and gender and economic equity. we promised to promote fraternity, dignity of the individual, and unity and integrity of the nation., on that day, we became the largest democracy of the world., , 3.the faith and commitment of people gave life to our constitution and our founding fathers, wisely and carefully, steered the new nation past its troubles of being a poor economy with huge regional imbalances and a vast citizenry deprived of even basic necessities., , 4.it goes to the credit of the strong institutions of democracy built by our founders that for the last six and a half decades, indian democracy has been an oasis of stability in the region troubled by unrest. from a population of 360 million in 1951, we are now a 1.3 billion strong nation. even then, our per capita income has shown a ten-fold increase, poverty ratio has declined by two-thirds, average life expectancy has more than doubled, and literacy rate has shown a four-fold increase. we are today the fastest growing amongst the major economies of the world. we are the second largest reservoir of scientific and technical manpower, the third largest army, the sixth member of the nuclear club, the sixth member in the race for space, and the tenth largest industrial power. from a net food grains importing country, india is now a leading exporter of food commodities. the journey so far has been eventful, sometimes painful, but most of the times, exhilarating., , 5.what has brought us thus far will take us further ahead. but we will have to learn to adjust our sails, quickly and deftly, to the winds of change. evolutionary and incremental growth will have to accommodate rapid disruptions brought in by advances of science and technology. innovation, more so inclusive innovation, will have to become a way of life. education will have to keep pace with technology. in the race between man and machine, the winner will have to be job generation. the velocity of technology adoption will call for a workforce that is willing to learn and adapt. our education system will have to join hands with innovation to prepare our youth for life-long learning., , fellow citizens:, 6.our economy has been performing well despite the challenging global economic conditions. in the first half of 2016-17, it grew at a rate of 7.2 percent – same as that last year – showing sustained recovery. we are firmly on the path of fiscal consolidation and our inflation level is within comfort zone. though our exports are yet to pick up, we have managed a stable external sector with sizeable foreign exchange reserves., , 7.demonetization, while immobilizing black money and fighting corruption, may have led to temporary slowdown of economic activity. as more and more transactions become cashless, it will improve the transparency of the economy., brothers and sisters:, , 8.born in independent india, three generations of citizens do not carry the baggage of colonial past. these generations have had the privilege of acquiring education, pursuing opportunities and chasing dreams in a free nation. this sometimes makes it easy for them to take freedom for granted; to forget the price that extraordinary men and women paid to win this freedom; to forget that the tree of freedom needs constant care and nourishment. democracy has conferred rights on each one of us. but along with these rights, come responsibilities which have to be discharged. gandhiji said and i quote: ""the highest form of freedom carries with it the greatest measure of discipline and humility. freedom that comes from discipline and humility cannot be denied; unbridled license is a sign of vulgarity injurious alike to self and others” (unquote)., , fellow citizens:, 9.youth today are brimming with hope and aspirations. they pursue their life goals, which they perceive will bring them fame, success and happiness, with single-minded devotion. they consider happiness as their existential objective, which of course is understandable. they search for happiness in the highs and lows of day-to-day emotions, and in the fulfilment of the objectives they have set for themselves. they look for a job as well as a purpose in life. lack of opportunities leads to frustration and unhappiness which manifests itself in anger, anxiety, stress and aberrations in behaviour. this has to be dealt with by inculcating pro-social behaviour through gainful employment, active engagement with community, parental guidance, and empathetic response from a caring society., brothers and sisters:, , 10.one of my predecessors left on my table a framed quotation which reads (and i quote): ""the object of government in peace and in war is not the glory of rulers or races but the happiness of the common man” (unquote). happiness is fundamental to the human experience of life. happiness is equally the outcome of economic and non-economic parameters. the quest for happiness is closely tied to sustainable development, which combines human well-being, social inclusion and environmental sustainability. we must make happiness and well-being of our people as the touchstones of public policy., , 11.many of the flagship initiatives of the government have been designed to promote the well-being of the society. the swachh bharat mission aims at a clean india by 2nd october, 2019 to coincide with the 150th birth anniversary of gandhiji. increased spending on programmes like mgnrega is enhancing employment generation to rejuvenate the rural economy. aadhaar, with its present reach of over 110 crore people, is helping in direct transfer of benefits, plugging leakages and improving transparency. the digital india programme is creating a knowledge economy through universal provision of digital infrastructure and platforms for cashless economic transactions. initiatives like start-up india and atal innovation mission are fostering innovation and new-age entrepreneurship. under the skill india initiative, the national skill development mission is working on skilling 300 million youth by 2022., , brothers and sisters:, 12.it is my firm conviction that india’s pluralism and her social, cultural, linguistic and religious diversity are our greatest strength. our tradition has always celebrated the ‘argumentative’ indian; not the ‘intolerant’ indian. multiple views, thoughts and philosophies have competed with each other peacefully for centuries in our country. a wise and discerning mind is necessary for democracy to flourish. more than the unison of ideas, a healthy democracy calls for conformity to the values of tolerance, patience and respect for others. these values must reside in the hearts and minds of every indian; inculcating in them a temperament of understanding and responsibility., , fellow citizens:, 13.we have a noisy democracy. yet, we need more and not less of democracy. the strength of our democracy is evidenced by the fact that over 66 percent of the total electorate of 834 million voted in the 2014 general elections. the depth and breadth of our democracy sparkles in the regular elections being held in our panchayati raj institutions. and yet, our legislatures lose sessions to disruptions when they should be debating and legislating on issues of importance. collective efforts must be made to bring the focus back to debate, discussion and decision-making., , 14.as our republic enters her sixty-eighth year, we must acknowledge that our systems are not perfect. the imperfections have to be recognized and rectified. the settled complacencies have to be questioned. the edifice of trust has to be strengthened. the time is also ripe for a constructive debate on electoral reforms and a return to the practice of the early decades after independence when elections to lok sabha and state assemblies were held simultaneously. it is for the election commission to take this exercise forward in consultation with political parties., , fellow citizens:, 15.in a fiercely competitive world, we have to work harder than ever to redeem the promises that we make to our people., , - we have to work harder because our war on poverty is not yet over. our economy is yet to grow at over 10 percent for an extended period of time to make a significant dent on poverty. one-fifth of our countrymen still remain below poverty line. gandhiji’s mission to wipe every tear from every eye still remains unfulfilled., , - we have to work harder to provide food security to our people and to make the agriculture sector resilient to the vagaries of nature. we have to provide better amenities and opportunities to our people in villages to ensure a decent quality of life., , - we have to work harder to provide enhanced employment opportunities to our youth through the creation of world-class manufacturing and services sectors. the competitiveness of the domestic industry has to be improved by focusing on quality, productivity and efficiency., , - we have to work harder to provide safety and security to our women and children. women must be able to lead their lives with honour and dignity. children must be able to enjoy their childhood to the fullest., , - we have to work harder to change our consumption pattern which has resulted in environmental and ecological de-gradation. we have to appease nature to prevent it from unleashing its fury in the form of floods, landslides and droughts., , - we have to work harder because our pluralistic culture and tolerance are still being put to test by vested interests. reason and moderation should be our guide in dealing with such situations., , - we have to work harder to keep at bay the dark forces of terrorism. these forces have to be dealt with firmly and decisively. the forces inimical to our interests cannot be allowed to grow., , - we have to work harder to ensure the well-being of our soldiers and security personnel who protect us from internal and external threats., and,, , -we have to work harder because;, we are all equal children before our mother;, and our motherland asks each of us in whatever role we play;, to do our duty;",0.15623289088362607,president '

both houses of parliament. this is a historic session heralding the advancement of the budget cycle and merger of the railway budget with the general budget for the first time in independent india. we gather once again to celebrate democracy, a cherished value and culture that has prospered throughout the long history of our nation. indeed, a culture that guides my government towards sabka saath, sabka vikas., 2. the ideal of saha na vavatu, saha nau bhunaktu - may we be protected together and blessed together with bliss - has inspired our civilisation from time immemorial. this year marks the 350 birth anniversary of the great sikh guru - guru gobind singhji. we are also observing the one thousandth birth anniversary of the great saint-philosopher ramanujacharya. the luminous path of

sacrifice for the larger good. this janashaktiis today our greatest strength., 4. the resilience and forbearance demonstrated by our countrymen, particularly the poor, recently in the fight against black money and corruption, is remarkable. the same spirit has driven the lpg ''give it up campaign."" over 1.2 crore consumers have voluntarily given up their lpg subsidy, which has helped the underprivileged in accessing lpg connections. this janashakti has transformedswachh bharatmission into a jan-andolan. 1.4 lakh villages, over 450 cities, 77 districts and 3 states have declared themselves open defecation free. my government salutes the strength of janashaktiand pledges to constructively utilise it in rashtra nirman., honourable members,, 5. at the core of all my government's policies is the welfare of the garib,dalit, peedit, shoshit, vanchit, kisan, shramik and yuva. my government is guided by the antyodaya philosophy of pandit deendayal upadhyaya. his centenary year is

the quality of life of the poor through assured housing, affordable healthcare, safe drinking water and sanitation, and access to clean energy., 11. my government is committed to provide shelter to every houseless poor household through the pradhan mantri aawas yojana with appropriate interest subvention on housing credit., 12. poor sanitation further weakens the economic wherewithal of a poor household. swachh bharat abhiyan aims to ensure health and sanitation, particularly for the poor. under this mission, more than 3 crore toilets have been constructed., 13. the pradhan mantri ujjwala yojana will make clean energy accessible to the poor. this scheme aims to safeguard the health of women and children by providing them with a clean cooking fuel – lpg, liberating them from the ill-effects of smoky kitchens, and long hours of collecting firewood. free gas connections are being provided to 5 crore poor households. already 1.5 crore connections have been provided in the

far benefited 55 lakh children.pradhan mantri bharatiya jan aushadi pariyojana has been launched to ensure that the poor have access to quality medicines at affordable prices. special facilities created to control the endemic japanese encephalitis have yielded encouraging results in significantly reducing mortality due to this disease., honourable members,, 16. in kisan'swelfare lies the nation's prosperity. a favourable monsoon after consecutive years of drought, supplemented by farmer-oriented schemes has increased the acreage and yield of most kharif crops. the sown area in the current rabi season has shown six percent increase in comparison to last year., 17. my government has taken various steps to transform the lives of our farmers. focus has been on holistic development of agriculture sector - making available affordable credit, ensuring assured supply of seeds and fertilizers, improving irrigation facilities, comprehensive risk coverage, improving productivity through soil health cards, assured market and remunerative prices for the produce through e-nam(national agriculture market)., 18. pradhan mantri fasal bima yojana expanded the ambit of risk-coverage, doubled the sum insured, and facilitated lowest-ever premium for the farmers. during kharif 2016, around 3.66 crore farmers were insured for a sum of rs. 1.4 lakh crore., 19. with the objective of

hectares have been brought under micro irrigation in the last two years., 21. honourable members may recall that soaring prices of pulses was a matter of grave concern around this time last year. my government has taken proactive steps and prices of pulses are now under control. to ensure fair price for farmers and to protect consumers, a buffer stock of 20 lakh tonnes of pulses has been envisaged against which 8 lakh tonnes of pulses have already been procured., honourable members,, 22. my government is making nari shakti an integral part of our development journey. our women deserve equal opportunity. the rio olympics, where we took great pride in the performance of p.v. sindhu, sakshi malik, deepa karmakarand others, illustrates the strength of our women. women are being inducted in combat streams of our armed forces. the nation is proud of its first three women fighter pilots. this reminds us of what we can achieve, as a nation, if women are fully empowered, and if their skills and talent are optimally utilised., 23. the beti bachao beti padhao scheme that addresses the issue of declining child sex ratio, is yielding encouraging results. under thesukanya samridhi yojana, launched with an objective of ensuring a secure future to our girl child, over one crore accounts have been opened and an amount of over rs. eleven thousand crore has been deposited.

2017-02-26,merely opening accounts for women won’t ensure equality ,"for some reason, the government appears to have developed last-minute cold feet about delivering the coup de grâce to the bharatiya mahila bank, started with much fanfare a few years ago as a bank of, for and by women, which has been going nowhere in a hurry since its launch. for a government headed by prime minister narendra modi, who has often reiterated that he is not one to shy away from tough decisions (and who amply demonstrated this strength of will with the demonetisation decision), this reluctance is puzzling. because killing the bharatiya mahila bank is not a very difficult decision to take. tokenism has never achieved anything much anywhere, let alone in the field of gender equality in financial inclusion., if simply having women running the show was the answer to addressing the vast gender imbalance prevailing in the financial services sector, the issue should have been solved without taking recourse to creating a special bank run by women. after all, india’s largest nationalised bank is run by a woman. so is india’s largest private sector bank. in fact, women-led banks in india – both nationalised and private sector – control an estimated 40% of assets in the banking sector. this is the highest proportion in the world – no other country comes even close. so, if having women in charge was the answer, the issue of gender inequality in financial services should have been solved. long ago., in fact, the biggest measure this government – or indeed any government that we have had so far – has taken towards redressing the gender imbalance in financial inclusion has been simply ensuring that more women have a bank account to start with. from 39% of women having bank accounts before the pradhan mantri jan-dhan yojana kicked off, the figure jumped to 61% of women within a year of the pmjdy being operational. this has been the largest single-year narrowing of the gender gap in banking achieved in any country in the world., this is a terrific beginning, but only the first step. simply opening a bank account for a woman does not make her financially independent, or even any greater a part of the financial system than she was before. unless the women actually start using these accounts, and banks actually start serving them as customers in their own right, even this spectacular achievement promises to remain no more than a tick in the tokenist checklist. at the moment, more than a third of pmjdy accounts are dormant. and 86% of women pmjdy account holders, according to a financial inclusion insights study, have only used their bank accounts for basic activities like deposits., lack of financial literacy is one big factor. a 2015 standard & poor’s survey on financial literacy found that 80% of female respondents in india were financially illiterate. there is a also a huge ‘digital divide’ – only 44% of women have a cell phone compared to over two-thirds of men in india. with ‘digital india’ driving digital delivery of financial services, this means that six out of ten women are automatically excluded., but these are solvable problems. accounts can be opened, cell-phone connections can be issued. but perceptions and attitudes cannot be changed by physical intervention. they need attitudinal change.",0.0447050172050172,merely opening

2017-03-26,how many indians have internet?,"official statistics suggest that the number is as high as 28% of the population. | photo credit: nissar ahmad , go digital or else. since demonetisation, the government has been sending out this stern message to citizens who are still wedded to cash transactions. but to go digital, a key prerequisite is access to the internet. how many indians have it?, official statistics suggest that the number is as high as 28% of the population., but as with most statistics, digging deeper reveals that this estimate could be wide off the mark., the telecom regulatory authority of india’s quarterly performance indicators report is the most authoritative source for assessing the march of the internet in india., the latest report tells us that india had 36.74 crore (367.48 million) internet subscribers in september 2016. based on a population count of 127.7 crore, it translates this into 28.77 internet subscribers per 100 population., this is the ‘internet penetration’ number that often gets cited in articles on digital india. but that’s a wrong interpretation of these statistics., trai data captures the number of internet connections in india and not the number of households with internet access. what’s the big difference?, well, if you live in an affluent neighbourhood in a metro, just look around you. if you have a four-member family (especially with teenagers), you are likely to own at least five internet connections – a broadband linked to your home computer and four 3g plans on your family-owned smartphones. while you have a surfeit of internet ‘access’, the driver of your car or the security guard at your apartment is unlikely to have any. instead of expensive broadband or 3g, they probably head to the browsing centre if they need the internet., this simple illustration tells you that 36.7 crore internet subscriptions don’t equal 36.7 crore indians connected to the internet. in fact, after doing away with such duplicate connections, it is almost a certainty that 28% of india’s population isn’t connected to the internet. depending on the number of connections hogged by the well-to-do city folk, the actual proportion may be half or even one-third that number., , to gauge the true extent of internet penetration, the question to ask is how many households in india have at least one internet connection., the previous census (2011) did this and found that 77 lakh households of the total 2,467 lakh households had it; that’s 3% of households. but then, the census only asked people about whether they had internet connections on their computers/laptops., it did not find out how many had internet connections on their mobile phones, which is likely to be a much bigger number. that gets us to the guesstimate that the actual internet penetration in india is somewhere between 3% and 28%. that’s a pretty wide range., the internet connections that india does have, are pretty unevenly distributed too., trai data recognises that while urban india has 61.9 internet subscriptions per 100 people, rural india gets by with just 13.7., there’s also a yawning gap in connectivity between states depending on the state of their network infrastructure and relative affluence. while the city of delhi alone boasts 2.2 crore internet connections, the entire north east has just 4.3 lakh. mumbai alone hogs almost half of the 3 crore connections in maharashtra. in most states, urban areas account for two-thirds of the internet users., many users are logged on to poor quality connections too, not allowing for data-intensive applications. this is not just due to patchy networks outside of the cities, but also because of the limited affordability of both devices and internet plans.",0.09902186893566203,many indians internet ?,"official statistics suggest number high 28 % population. &#124; photo credit : nissar ahmad , go digital else. since demonetisation , government sending stern message citizens still wedded cash transactions. go digital , key prerequisite access internet. many indians it?

2017-04-25,silence on vigilantism is not an option,"when was the last time the hindu community asked itself the question ‘who are we’? the last of the interrogators of hindu society was, arguably, dr. b.r. ambedkar. he catapulted to the forefront of the political agenda the many oppressions, discriminations, and exclusions of hinduism, and thus compelled at least public intellectuals to investigate tradition and reflect on the malaise of the community. after him no one has really looked within the collective self, reflected, and considered., this is a great tragedy, because unless a society asks fundamental questions of itself, it is doomed to complacency and stagnation, or simply doomed. disdaining the stimulating intellectual exercise of examining the collective self, we have swept the failings of our society under the metaphorical carpet. lulled into complacency by meaningless assertions — ‘say with pride we are hindu’, or a ‘new india’, or a ‘sanitised india’, or a ‘digital india’ — few people ask why we still practise caste discrimination, why we continue to be disgracefully hostile to religious minorities, or why we are indifferent to the plight of our own people., in a democratic political community, citizens owe obligations of justice to their fellow citizens. if the basic rights of an individual or a community are systematically violated, there should be pain, there should be empathy and outrage, and a determination to do something about the fundamental infringement of what is owed to human beings: dignity and respect. but we follow our own star; indifferent to the deplorable lack of solidarity in our community., this is our tragedy, a double tragedy, because we are the inheritors of a rich history of public intellectuals, philosophers, social and religious reformers, and national leaders asking crucial questions of indian society since the beginning of the nineteenth century. this was the beginning of the indian renaissance, and these questions escalated till the middle of the twentieth century. but no more., today, hindu society is complicit in massive crimes perpetrated against dalits, muslims, and women, because it is silent in the face of atrocities practised by vigilantes who single-handedly define what they consider ‘morality’, and who punish people merely on suspicion that they violate codes of hinduism. backed by powerful political patrons and a compliant police force, vigilantes are legislators, prosecutors, juries and executioners rolled into one. reports in our daily newspaper bring stories of horrific violence perpetrated by vigilantes masquerading as the keeper of the keys to the hindu kingdom. this abnormality in our political life has become a normal way of doing politics. we should realise that democracy has been subverted, the rule of law has become redundant, and that our representatives are responsible for this serious deviation in political life. but we are silent., in early april, cow vigilantes attacked 15 muslim men in the district of alwar because they were transporting cows. one person died in the appalling violence, others were hospitalised. the rajasthan home minister, gulab singh kataria, defended vigilantes on the plea that cow smuggling is banned in rajasthan. apart from the fact that the victims possessed government documents allowing them to transport cows, the minister’s words trivialise the system of justice. if people break a law, they should be hauled up before a court of justice for ‘the law to take its own course’. the law is, however, brushed aside as a slight inconvenience, as mercenaries attack the most vulnerable in our society, the dalits and muslims. this viciousness and this savagery is the new normal. and we watch in silence!, vigilantism takes vicious shapes. in 2011 m.f. husain died in loneliness and in exile, separated from his beloved country and its mythologies, to which he paid poetic homage on canvas. some years before his death, london-based vigilantes ransacked an exhibition in asia house that showcased some of hussain’s paintings, and damaged priceless pieces of art. in india, the works of the gifted artist were not allowed to be exhibited, warrants were prepared for his arrest by the police, and hussain had to leave the country of his birth. we live in an age when anyone, with no understanding, let alone appreciation, of aesthetics, metaphors, and allegories, can rule which painting, which book, which film can enter the public domain., deepa mehta could not shoot her film on widows in the ashrams of varanasi. and now sanjay leela bhansali, known more for his lavish presentations than serious cinema, has been put on notice by the activist group rajput karni sena. bollywood producers, directors and actors have for long genuflected before the leadership of the shiv sena and maharashtra navnirman sena to ensure that their films could be released. the process has reached its natural culmination point, and now self-appointed censors force film-makers to follow ‘this’ and not ‘that’ script.",0.03573418003565063,silence vigilantism option,"last time hindu community asked question ‘who ’ ? last interrogators hindu society , arguably , dr. b.r. ambedkar. catapulted forefront political agenda many oppressions , discriminations , exclusions hinduism , thus compelled least public intellectuals investigate tradition reflect malaise community. one really looked within collective self , reflected , considered. , great tragedy , unless society asks fundamental questions , doomed complacency stagnation , simply doomed. disdaining stimulating intellectual exercise examining collective self , swept failings society metaphorical carpet. lulled complacency meaningless assertions — ‘say pride hindu ’ , ‘new india ’ , ‘sanitised india ’ , ‘digital india ’ — people ask still practise caste discrimination , continue disgracefully hostile religious minorities , indifferent plight people. , democratic political community , citizens owe obligations justice fellow citizens. basic rights individual community systematically violated , pain , empathy outrage , determination something fundamental infringement owed human beings : dignity respect. follow star ;

2017-09-04,economy outlook still cloudy ,"the government’s move this past week to publish economic data for the april to june quarter of this year needs a look. the real growth of gdp, i.e. after removing the impact of inflation, was only 5.7%, much lower than expected. for the past six consecutive quarters, the growth rate has gone down steadily, from 9.2% at the end of the quarter ending march 2016, to 7.9%, 7.5%, 7.0%, 6.1% and now 5.7% at the end of the june quarter., this steady declining trend in the growth rate is all the more troublesome because the economy otherwise enjoys a rather conducive combination of macroeconomic parameters. inflation has been moderate, and touched a low of 1.5% recently. both trade and fiscal deficits are moderate and manageable. so they don’t eat up investible resources or precious foreign exchange. even the interest rate has been cut repeatedly over the past year and a half. the inward rush of dollars is at a peak, both in financial markets (stocks and bonds) and as direct investment. no wonder the stock market index is at an all-time high. even oil prices, the bane of the indian economy, have been stable and comfortably low. finally, the monsoon has been normal. so despite these favourable macro factors, we have not managed to convert them into a higher growth rate., as cautioned in the economic survey tabled recently in parliament, it looks as if the growth rate will be below 7% this fiscal year. that would be a potential loss of 1% growth, which we can legitimately aspire for. in nominal terms, one percentage less of growth translates into a loss of ₹1.5 lakh crore of national income. this is a notional loss, or is rather what might have been. it also signifies millions of jobs not created., if you look closer at the numbers, you find that manufacturing growth at 1.2% is the lowest in the past five years. it’s the lowest since we switched to a new methodology (based on gross value added). some of this downward movement was caused supposedly by the suspension of manufacturing activity prior to the rollout of the goods and services tax (gst) in july, and consequent de-stocking of inventory. but it is also corroborated by data from commercial banks. from april to august bank credit shrank by 1.8%, i.e. negative growth. this is the lowest it has been for at least 13 years. if you remove retail loans such as housing and other personal loans, credit to industry might actually be shrinking. this was flagged back in april also when the annual credit flow from banking for the previous fiscal year clocked a multi-decadal low. a state bank of india report said that credit growth for the year ending last march was the lowest in 63 years!, the gdp is measured in at least two different ways. the first is by looking at the production side while the second is by looking at the spending side. we look at the aggregate of all spending, whether on consumption, or by foreigners buying our exports, or on investments into new factories and projects. in addition we also have government spending. the growth in gdp can be traced to the growth and vigour of each of these components. investment, which is between 30 and 35% of the total pie, needs to grow at least in double digits. investment in future capacity creates gdp growth of the future. it needs to be led by the private sector. currently, that component is barely growing at 1.5%. this is the single most telling metric. as a result, capital formation (the basis of future growth) is steadily declining for several years. private sector investment has practically come to a standstill. despite the push for ‘make in india’, reforms for improving ‘ease of doing business’, increased access to electricity, improvement in infrastructure and private investment are not picking up. this must become the big priority. initiatives such as housing for all, smart cities and digital india give room for huge opportunities for private entrepreneurs. of course the corporate sector and banks have been affected by the twin balance sheet squeeze wherein corporates are over-leveraged, and banks have mounting bad loans. whether the new insolvency code and regulator and the reserve bank of india’s aggressive intervention will crack this puzzle remains to be seen., another significant challenge to the domestic industry is the ever-strengthening rupee. since january the rupee is 7% stronger compared to the american dollar. it is stronger than its asian peer currencies too, including china, the philippines, indonesia and thailand. this directly hurts our export prospects. since last october, our export growth has begun showing positive growth, after a long phase of negative growth for 18 months. but thanks to the strong rupee, this trend is weakening. indeed our exports are barely up 12% since january, whereas imports are up more than 30%.",0.026919523643661573,economy outlook still cloudy,"government ’ move

2017-09-04,search for a new equilibrium ,"prime minister narendra mod being greeted by chinese president xi jinping as he arrives for a group photo during the brics summit in xiamen, china's fujian province on monday. | photo credit: afp , the doklam stand-off has been resolved and its strategic implication is that a confident india now considers china an equal partner, no longer leaning on the united states for support, and showing a capacity to resolve a complex situation through classic negotiation and ‘give and take’, setting a useful precedent for exploring solutions to broader issues through direct discussions., in their bilateral meeting, at astana in june, india and china recognised that “differences should not become disputes” and “their relations are a factor of stability” in a “multipolar world, and at a time of global instability”. china’s official news agency xinhua later called for the ancient civilizations to become “cooperative partners”, “develop complementary industries and cooperate in protecting common security” for “achieving the dream of an asian century”. after the doklam settlement, wang yi, china’s foreign minister, saw “huge potential for cooperation…. under the principle of mutual respect … to work together for the rejuvenation of asia and for the development of our region and contribute our share to greater development.” strategic convergence will need recognition of the asian century with two nodes., potential of digital economy, the digital economy could be the basis of cooperative partnership. the digital economy is expected to be the biggest generator of new market growth opportunities and jobs in the next 30 to 40 years. knowledge-intensive flows, rather than labour, capital, or resource-intensive flows, already account for half of global flows and are gaining share. building on “digital india” could add a value of about a trillion dollars over the next five years in india. the experience of operating in a linguistically and culturally diverse environment will be indispensable for the asian century as global growth shifts to asian cities., the re-emergence of china, and india should be seen as a case of their cooperative coexistence for 2,000 years rather than through the prism of the west., until the mid-18th century, textiles from india were the largest globally traded commodity. chinese silk and porcelain were the most important luxury items and both nations only wanted silver in exchange. contrary to their peaceful rise and co-existence with two-thirds of global wealth in these civilisational states, the west grew rich through monopoly trade, expropriation, war and even innovation driven by the needs of the military., india’s bri concerns, in a multipolar world, countries are again gaining in influence more because of the strength of their economy than their military might. emerging economies, both as exporters and as importers, now account for 40% of goods flows, and 60% of these go to other emerging economies, most of them in asia. a third of the world’s economic activity involves cross-border flows. countries that are more connected within global networks can expect to increase gdp growth from flows of up to 40% more than the least connected countries. that is why, despite misgivings, china’s bridge & road initiative (bri) enabled connectivity has been widely welcomed in asia and in the west for providing new markets., as in the case of doklam, india has to find creative ways of raising its concerns on the bri rather than staying away. at doklam, india’s concern was the road, not sovereignty. similarly, india could work with china to widen the scope of the kashgar-gwadar portion of the bri to chabahar, 72 miles away in iran, recognising the territorial dispute and skirting the issue of sovereignty in the rules of the bri. in light of china’s keenness for partnership in the bri, india should really ‘act east’, not west, for linkages with projects in other south-east asian countries and with india’s connectivity initiatives in africa., asia — soon to have two-thirds of global wealth — provides as much opportunity to india as it does to china and chinese acts of assertion should not be interpreted as aggressiveness. china’s achilles heel is that it is ageing at an unprecedented pace while india’s working age population will increase till 2050 and economic growth will continue overtaking that of the united states. china’s working age population peaked in 2012; the median age will rise to 49 by 2050. with debt nearly at 300% of gdp, there is a small window to achieve the ‘national dream’ of getting rich before the country gets old and it does not have an appetite for aggression against a resolute neighbour.",0.10503952569169962,search new equilibrium,"prime minister narendra mod greeted chinese president xi jinping arrives group photo brics summit xiamen , china ' fujian province monday. &#124;

2017-09-04,economy outlook still cloudy ,"the government’s move this past week to publish economic data for the april to june quarter of this year needs a look. the real growth of gdp, i.e. after removing the impact of inflation, was only 5.7%, much lower than expected. for the past six consecutive quarters, the growth rate has gone down steadily, from 9.2% at the end of the quarter ending march 2016, to 7.9%, 7.5%, 7.0%, 6.1% and now 5.7% at the end of the june quarter., this steady declining trend in the growth rate is all the more troublesome because the economy otherwise enjoys a rather conducive combination of macroeconomic parameters. inflation has been moderate, and touched a low of 1.5% recently. both trade and fiscal deficits are moderate and manageable. so they don’t eat up investible resources or precious foreign exchange. even the interest rate has been cut repeatedly over the past year and a half. the inward rush of dollars is at a peak, both in financial markets (stocks and bonds) and as direct investment. no wonder the stock market index is at an all-time high. even oil prices, the bane of the indian economy, have been stable and comfortably low. finally, the monsoon has been normal. so despite these favourable macro factors, we have not managed to convert them into a higher growth rate., as cautioned in the economic survey tabled recently in parliament, it looks as if the growth rate will be below 7% this fiscal year. that would be a potential loss of 1% growth, which we can legitimately aspire for. in nominal terms, one percentage less of growth translates into a loss of ₹1.5 lakh crore of national income. this is a notional loss, or is rather what might have been. it also signifies millions of jobs not created., if you look closer at the numbers, you find that manufacturing growth at 1.2% is the lowest in the past five years. it’s the lowest since we switched to a new methodology (based on gross value added). some of this downward movement was caused supposedly by the suspension of manufacturing activity prior to the rollout of the goods and services tax (gst) in july, and consequent de-stocking of inventory. but it is also corroborated by data from commercial banks. from april to august bank credit shrank by 1.8%, i.e. negative growth. this is the lowest it has been for at least 13 years. if you remove retail loans such as housing and other personal loans, credit to industry might actually be shrinking. this was flagged back in april also when the annual credit flow from banking for the previous fiscal year clocked a multi-decadal low. a state bank of india report said that credit growth for the year ending last march was the lowest in 63 years!, the gdp is measured in at least two different ways. the first is by looking at the production side while the second is by looking at the spending side. we look at the aggregate of all spending, whether on consumption, or by foreigners buying our exports, or on investments into new factories and projects. in addition we also have government spending. the growth in gdp can be traced to the growth and vigour of each of these components. investment, which is between 30 and 35% of the total pie, needs to grow at least in double digits. investment in future capacity creates gdp growth of the future. it needs to be led by the private sector. currently, that component is barely growing at 1.5%. this is the single most telling metric. as a result, capital formation (the basis of future growth) is steadily declining for several years. private sector investment has practically come to a standstill. despite the push for ‘make in india’, reforms for improving ‘ease of doing business’, increased access to electricity, improvement in infrastructure and private investment are not picking up. this must become the big priority. initiatives such as housing for all, smart cities and digital india give room for huge opportunities for private entrepreneurs. of course the corporate sector and banks have been affected by the twin balance sheet squeeze wherein corporates are over-leveraged, and banks have mounting bad loans. whether the new insolvency code and regulator and the reserve bank of india’s aggressive intervention will crack this puzzle remains to be seen., another significant challenge to the domestic industry is the ever-strengthening rupee. since january the rupee is 7% stronger compared to the american dollar. it is stronger than its asian peer currencies too, including china, the philippines, indonesia and thailand. this directly hurts our export prospects. since last october, our export growth has begun showing positive growth, after a long phase of negative growth for 18 months. but thanks to the strong rupee, this trend is weakening. indeed our exports are barely up 12% since january, whereas imports are up more than 30%.",0.026919523643661573,economy outlook still cloudy,"government ’ move

i am pleased that india has displayed the courage and leadership to take tough decisions which have launched the interlinked process of sustainable development. the complete eradication of poverty is the most important priority of the present government. mr. president, there are two ways of addressing the curse of poverty. the traditional method is through incremental levels of aid and hand-holding. but our prime minister narendra modi has chosen the more radical route, through economic empowerment. the poor are not helpless: we have merely denied them opportunity. we are eliminating poverty by investing in the poor. we are turning them from job-seekers into job-providers., 8: all our economic programmes have a principal purpose, die empowerment of the poor; jan dhan, mudra, ujjwala, skill india, digital india, clean india, start-up india, stand-up india. to describe them all would take up more time than 1have at my disposal, and i shall therefore dwell on only three core programmes., 9: the jan dhan plan must surely count as the world's largest financial inclusion scheme. at least 300 million indians who had never crossed the doors of a bank today have bank accounts; this is equivalent to the population of the united states of america. this was, understandably, not easy to complete in three years, but our banks, achieved this visionary goal set by our prime minister. while some remain to be included, the target has been set — every indian family will have a bank account., 10; mudra yojana has enabled government to fund the unfunded. those who had never dreamt that bank credit was within their options, today, through mudra, are getting soft loans without collateral to begin micro businesses. 1 am particularly delighted to inform you that over 70 per cent of these loans have gone to women. unemployment spreads despair. through skill india, start-up india and stand-up india poor and middle class youth are being trained to match their honed talent with bank credit and become self-employed or small-scale entrepreneurs., 11: ujjwala is a signature scheme of our government. free gas cylinders are being provided to the poor so that women do not have to suffer the dangerous consequences of wood-fired kitchens. uniquely, gender emancipation is at the creative core of this programme., 12: demonetisation was a courageous decision to challenge one of the by products of corruption, the ""black money"" that disappeared from circulation. today, india has passed the goods and services tax legislation, through which there is one-tax across the country, without the untidy and punishing system of multiple taxes under differing categories in different parts of the country. our ""save the girl, educate the girl"" campaign is reducing gender inequality. our clean india programme is generating what can only be described as a revolutionary change in social attitudes and habits., 13: i would like to note, at this point, that nations with rising capabilities will be able to generate such change, but the developed world must become an active partner in helping those vulnerable countries which are still mired in stagnant poverty reach sdg horizon within 2030. that is why the principle of global partnership was included in sdgs. i am happy to report that india has started, this year, the india-un development partnership fund., , mr. president, 14: we are completely engaged in fighting poverty; alas, our neighbour pakistan seems only engaged in fighting us. on thursday, from this dais, pakistan's prime minister shahid khakan abbasi wasted rather too much of his speech in making accusations against us. he accused india of state-sponsored terrorism, and of violating human rights. those listening had only one observation: ""look who's talking!"" a country that has been the world's greatest exporter of havoc, death and inhumanity became a champion of hypocrisy by preaching about humanity from this podium., 15: pakistan's prime minister claimed that his nation's founder mohammad ali jinnah had bequeathed a foreign policy based on peace and friendship. i would like to remind him that while it remains open to question whether jinnah sahab actually advocated such principles, what is beyond doubt is that india's prime minister narendra modi has, from the moment he took his oath of office, offered the hand of peace, and friendship. pakistan's prime minister must answer why his nation spurned this offer., 16: prime minister abbasi has recalled old resolutions that have been long overtaken by events. but his memory has conveniently failed him where it matters. he has forgotten that under the shimla agreement and the lahore declaration india and pakistan resolved that they would settle all outstanding issues bilaterally. the reality is that pakistan's politicians remember everything, manipulate memory into a convenience. they are masters at ""forgetting"" facts that destroy their version., 17: pakistan's current prime minister spoke of a ""comprehensive dialogue"" between our two countries. i would like to remind him that on 9 december 2015, when i was in islamabad for the heart of asia conference, a decision was made by his leader mian nawaz sharif, then still prime minister, that dialogue between us should be renewed and named it a ""comprehensive bilateral dialogue"". the word ""bilateral"" was used consciously to remove any confusion or doubt about the fact that the proposed talks would be between our two nations and only between our two nations, without any third-party present. and he must answer why that proposal withered, because pakistan is responsible for the aborting that peace process., 18: i would like today to tell pakistan's politicians just this much, that perhaps the wisest thing they could do is to look within. india and pakistan became free within hours of each other. why is it that today india is a recognised it superpower in the world, and pakistan is recognised only as the pre-eminent export factory for terror?, 19: india has risen despite being the principal destination of pakistan s nefarious export of terrorism. there have been many governments under many parties during 70 years of indian freedom, for we have been a sustained democracy. every government has done its bit for india's development. we have marched ahead, consistently, without pause, in education, health and across the range of human welfare. we established scientific and technical institutions which are the pride of the world. but what has pakistan offered to the world and indeed to its own people apart from terrorism? we produced scholars, doctors, engineers. what have you produced? you have produced terrorists. doctors save people from death; terrorists send them to death. if pakistan had spent on its development what it has spent on developing terror, both pakistan and the world would be safer and better-off today., , mr. president, 20: terrorism is at the very top of problems for which the united nations is searching for solutions. we have been the oldest victims of this terrible and even traumatic terrorism. when we began articulating about this menace, many of the world's big powers dismissed this as a law and order issue. now they know better. the question is: what do we do about it?, 21: we must all introspect and ask ourselves whether our talk is anywhere close to the action we take. we all condemn this evil, and piously resolve to fight it in all our declaratory statements. the truth is that these have become rituals. the fact is that when we are required to fight and destroy this enemy, the self-interest of some leads them, towards duplicity., 22: this has been going on for years. although india proposed a comprehensive convention on international terrorism (ccit) as early as in 1996, yet two decades later the united nations has not been able to agree upon a definition of terrorism. if we cannot agree to define our enemy, how can we fight together? if we continue to differentiate between good terrorists and bad terrorists, how can we fight together? if even the united nations security council cannot agree on the listing of terrorists, how can we fight together?, , mr. president, 23: through you, with utmost sincerity i would like to request this august assembly to stop seeing this evil with self-defeating and indeed meaningless nuance. evil is evil. let us accept that terrorism is an existentialist danger to humankind. there is absolutely no justification for this barbaric violence. let us display our new commitment by reaching agreement on the comprehensive convention on international terrorism this year itself., , mr. president, 24: i had- identified climate change as one of the significant dangers to our existence. india has already said that it is deeply committed to the paris accord. this is not because we are afraid of any power, influenced by friend or foe, or tempted by some imagined greed. this is an outcome of a philosophy that is at least 5000 years old. our prime minister has, on his personal initiative, launched the international solar alliance as witness to our abiding commitment to a cause., 25: when we talk of world peace, we mean peace not only among, human beings but also peace with nature. we understand that human nature is sometimes inimical to nature, but we would like to amend human nature when it tends in the wrong, directions. when we inflict our greed upon nature, nature sometimes explodes. we must learn to live with the imperatives, cycles and creative urges of nature; in that lies, our own salvation., 26: we have just witnessed hurricanes, earthquakes, rains that inundate, storms which terrify. this is not a mere coincidence. nature sent its warning to the world even before the world's leadership gathered in new york at the united nations through harvey. once our gathering began an earthquake struck mexico and a hurricane landed in dominica. we must understand this requires more serious action than talk. the developed world must listen more carefully than others, because it has more capacities than others. it must help the less fortunate through technology transfer and green climate financing – that is the only way to save future generations., , mr. president, 27: we are discussing turbulence and change across the world, but the one organisation created to address world affairs is beset by its own problems. it seems to believe that it can afford not to change from the precepts and perceptions that determined its birth. on 18 september, there was a meeting here on un reform. i participated. i witnessed an evident desire for change, to do something. but 1do want to remind you that at the 2005 world summit there was a consensus that the early reform of the security council is an essential element of our overall effort to reform the united nations., 28: efforts at text-based negotiations on the reform and expansion of the security council were initiated in the last session and more than 160 nations had expressed support for this effort. if we are serious, then the least we can do is produce one text that can be the basis for negotiation. i hope that under your enlightened leadership, mr. president, this will become a priority. if that happens it will be a significant achievement., 29: we also have high expectations from the new secretary general of the united nations. if he wants to reform the peace and security architecture, he will also need to address reforms related to peacekeeping that have been urged for long. without improvements in un peacekeeping this goal can't be achieved., , mr. president, 30: there is no shortage of issues; there is even less shortage of problems which should be recognised from this podium. but time is not always on the side of those who would like to raise issues and problems in the interests of a better, more peaceful and progressive future. the issues you have chosen are relevant to the un charter as well as to the ancient traditions of my land., , mr. president, 31: my country's culture and thought has been shaped by a history and philosophy that believes in peace as humankind's only rational and practical objective. we truly believe that the world is one family and we hope that every member of this family deserves that elixir of life, happiness., , let me end by reciting a verse that is a synthesis of thought:, may all be happy;, may all be healthy;",0.07027070635279589,text sushma swaraj ' speech u.n. general assembly,"external affairs minister sushma swaraj addresses 72nd session united nations general assembly un headquarters new york saturday. &#124;

2017-09-27,"bharti to lead telecom firms in spending ₹50,000 cr. this year","india’s largest telecom player bharti airtel is investing ₹18,000-₹20,000 crore this year in building hard infrastructure and the industry as a whole is likely to invest anywhere between ₹50,000-₹60,000 crore in 2017-18, according to bharti airtel chairman sunil mittal. , mooting a collaborative approach between telecom players, including mukesh ambani’s reliance jio, in areas such as shared telecom towers and fibre networks, mr. mittal said on wednesday that government policies must make it easier for telecom companies to do business in order to expedite the impact of these investments., terming data as the ‘new oil’ that india does not need to import, mr. ambani, who shared the stage with mr. mittal at the maiden india mobile congress in the capital, said while the country may have missed out on the last three industrial revolutions, it was well well-poised to take the lead in the fourth one fuelled by data, connectivity and artificial intelligence., ‘data super abundance’, “we have data in super abundance,” said mr. ambani. “it will be a new source of value and will create opportunities and prosperity for india and millions of indians,” he said, adding he saw india’s economy expanding to $7 trillion in 10 years, from the current level of $2.5 trillion., “data is the oxygen of a digital economy. we cannot deprive indians of this vital life-sustaining resource. we have to provide ubiquitous access to high-speed data at affordable prices,” the reliance industries chairman said, predicting that india’s 4g coverage would become larger than 2g coverage in the next 12 months., “there’s generally an accusation on the indian industry for the last two or three years that we don’t invest enough,” mr. mittal said at the inaugural session of the congress, where oil and skill development minister dharmendra pradhan, electronics and it minister ravi shankar prasad and telecom minister manoj sinha were present. “partly, i will concede you are right. but the telecom industry in particular is an exception.” , “my own company airtel has put in about ₹10,000 crore upto september this year on hard infrastructure. this year, we plan to put in ₹18,000-₹20,000 crore investment. mukesh (ambani) is putting up a lot of investment and i am sure other telecom players are as well. so nearly ₹50,000-₹60,000 crore is going in this year to build hard digital infrastructure,” he said. , though the government had eased right of way norms and opened up central government buildings for telecom towers, mr. mittal said that getting permissions at the ground level was still a slow process., “state governments, municipalities and local authorities must understand the power of digital india and support what we are trying to do, as per the vision of the prime minister,” he added. , admitting that the industry faced challenges, mr. mittal said that he was confident that india would be the biggest telecom market in the world with its large population and the pm’s belief in using digital platforms to serve the people., ‘none can do it alone’, “clearly, as mukesh pointed out, none of us can do it alone. we all have to come together while we compete alone for the benefit of customers, we have to collaborate among ourselves to create the ecosystem using common fibres, common towers and so on,” he said, adding that india would no longer be behind the curve on the adoption of new telecom technologies such as 5g.

2017-11-23, dance in the digital age,"bharat and sharath prabhat , there’s been a paradigm shift in all fields of human endeavour. so it is not surprising to see art becoming entertainment. and in digital india, everything has taken on newer avatars., “contemporary art scene in india is getting more and more vibrant. this is because people want to make sense of their experiences of living in a modern world. they are constantly looking for ways to process the issues and their concerns and fears. we could engage with contemporary arts as a maker or a receiver. i often think that our body is the carrier of many experiences , which in a way shape who we are and define our identity. therefore, when you work with your body, you are not only engaging with layers of history and heritage but also processing many of your deeper and personal thoughts. therefore, contemporary dance as a medium is sacred and when expressed with commitment and conviction, encapsulates the spirit and pulse of our times,” says master of this medium jayachandran palazhy, who is the artistic director, attakkalari centre for movement arts., shama bhate of pune was inspired by s.h. raza’s ‘bindu’ series of paintings “because their contemplativeness and quietude helped my kathak seamlessly reach ‘sam’ .” shama bhate created many such works although they were more a projection of abstract paintings. today many groups, especially contemporary, use technology such as laser lights and spilt screens. but it is important that technology does not overshadow artistic skills. is it art or craft? the difference lies in the level of skill. when a skill is honed and mastered, it gives the illusion of being on auto pilot. which is why, when one sees valli or malavika dance, it looks effortless. few realise it is because of decades of practise and total surrender to art ., madhu natraj had done a commissioned work, ‘vajra’ some five years ago. where her artistry rose as her team created magic with movements backed by digital art as a prop., , while india imbibes such trends and technologies from abroad and adapts it to local conditions, end results are reasonably good. ‘jungle book’ done by a bangalore group, two brothers bharat and sharath prabhat for nadam fest was as good as a broadway production. there was good synergy between stage and screen. 3d screen images made it a riveting show., “dance was always interactive. only the mode of interaction keeps changing. in traditional folk forms a performer often turns the village or temple courtyards into a stage and makes his recitals interactive. according to natyashastra and the rasa theory, interaction between the audience and the performer is crucial in the production of rasa, which is the hallmark of any good performance., “natysastra even states that for a good performance, we need to have an ideal performer, audience and performance space. this, of course, one can only achieve rarely. this concept is still valid. a history of viewing helps the audience to understand and appreciate contemporary dance. like any other language, the visual and theatrical language of the performance can be deciphered best when one understands the basic grammar and syntax of those forms. classical performances are best appreciated when one has a basic knowledge of the stories depicted and some idea of what the mudras mean,” says palazhy., ‘matsyavtar’ was a breathtaking production by mayuri madhuri upadhaya sisters, where underwater sequences attained depth due to digital projection.",0.2564743589743589,dance digital age,"bharat sharath prabhat , ’ paradigm shift fields human endeavour. surprising see art becoming entertainment. digital india , everything taken newer avatars. , “contemporary art scene india getting vibrant. people want make sense experiences living modern world. constantly looking ways process issues concerns fears. could engage contemporary arts maker receiver. often think body carrier many experiences , way shape define identity. therefore , work body , engaging layers history heritage also processing many deeper personal thoughts. therefore , contemporary dance medium sacred expressed commitment conviction , encapsulates spirit pulse times , ” says master medium jayachandran palazhy , artistic director , attakkalari centre movement arts. , shama bhate pune inspired s.h. raza ’ ‘bindu ’ series paintings “because contemplativeness quietude helped kathak seamlessly reach ‘sam ’ . ” shama bhate created many works although projection abstract paintings. today many groups , especially contemporary , use technology laser lights spilt screens. important technology overshadow artistic skills. art craft ?

2017-11-27,students will see benefits of online system from next exam cycle: nagendran sundararajan,"software service provider merittrac’s implementation of the on-screen marking system (osm) in mumbai university was far from perfect, resulting in inordinate delays in declaring results, confusion among evaluators, alleged loss of answer sheets, widespread student protests, rise in demand for revaluation and collapse of the academic schedule. , in an email interview, nagendran sundararajan, executive vice-president of merittrac, explains what went wrong with the varsity’s online assessment system., how long does it take to digitise an answer sheet and declare results?, merittrac has a capacity to digitise one lakh answer scripts a day. as exams are staggered over 45 days, digitising 40,000 to 50,000 answer scripts would be adequate to meet the result declaration deadline. on many days, merittrac was able to digitise more than 75,000 answer scripts. following evaluation of the answer scripts, merittrac submitted results within 24 hours. later, the varsity started tabulating results when 95% of scripts of a programme were evaluated., what delayed the evaluation? , evaluating answer scripts was the varsity’s task. with exams being conducted for over 390 programmes, around 3,600 question papers had to be prepared. may 12 was set as the day of evaluation, but merittrac had no control over the availability of teachers and their evaluation of answer scripts. on days when the varsity ensured over 5,000 teachers out of a pool of 15,000 were able for evaluation, over one lakh answer scripts were evaluated. on an average, around 60,000 answer scripts were evaluated per day. ideally, answer scripts should have been available on the server seven to 10 days after the evaluation. however, unavailability of teachers delayed the evaluation process and the varsity had to extend the evaluation of answer scripts of a few programmes till september., when did you finish digitising the answer scripts? , digitisation began as soon as the answer scripts were received. over seven weeks, starting from may 4, answer scripts were transported in batches from the varsity’s warehouse to scanning centres. on may 18, one lakh answer scripts were made available on the varsity’s server. by june 28, 80% of the scripts were available, and by the first week of july, 90% of the scripts were available for evaluation. at no point of time was the evaluation process hampered by lack of answer scripts on the server., when were scores sent to the varsity for tabulation of results? , once evaluation was done for a programme, the scores were compiled and shared with the varsity in the required format within 24 hours. the varsity then fed the scores into its foxpro programme and linked them to the each student’s data such as attendance, bar codes and seat numbers., are you equipped to assess the answer papers of 481 exams written by over four lakh students? , merittrac is more than equipped to meet the varsity’s requirements. merittrac’s capability was never in question., did the system account for supplementary answer sheets used by students? , the osm platform can handle answer scripts with more than 40 pages. the supplementary sheets will have to be tagged to the main answer script with a unique bar code or seat number. mu is responsible for printing answer scripts, and allocating bar codes and seat numbers., how do you respond to allegations that you weren’t able to handle the task? , merittrac was awarded only 25% to 30% of the overall evaluation. critical tasks, including tabulating results, adding internal assessment marks, assigning overall weightage, were the university’s responsibility. and these processes delayed the final declaration of results., what was merittrac’s role? , merittrac was only tasked with digitising answer scripts, placing them in the server and sharing the scores with the university., were the answer sheets lost while being digitised? , there was no question of merittrac losing the answer scripts as they were always kept on the university’s premises, which was under constant supervision. the digitised answer sheets are available on the server for six months for re-evaluation., who has access to the digitised answer sheets? , only teachers authorised by the university can access the digitised answer sheets by logging into the osm platform. there is a two-step authentication process, which includes a one-time password delivered to the teacher’s registered mobile number and e-mail id., how will you improve the implementation of the online assessment system? , increasing awareness of the osm platform among key stakeholders will improve overall efficiency. proper planning is necessary before the start of the assessment process. the university has to drive the evaluation process and ensure teachers stick to deadlines. the osm platform has the capability to provide crucial inputs to policy makers, which could drive smart interventions in the academic system., who is to blame for the collapse of the varsity’s digital initiative? , the allegations against merittrac are baseless. vested interests might not want the university to progress in the digital space. merittrac is committed to supporting the government’s digital india initiatives and prioritising the larger perspectives of all stakeholders.",0.16253501400560225,students see benefits online system next exam cycle : nagendran sundararajan,"software service provider merittrac ’ implementation on-screen marking system ( osm ) mumbai university far perfect , resulting inordinate delays declaring results , confusion among evaluators , alleged loss answer sheets , widespread student protests , rise demand revaluation collapse academic schedule. , email interview , nagendran sundararajan , executive vice-president merittrac , explains went wrong varsity ’ online assessment system. , long take digitise answer sheet declare results?
