2009-09-18,the nuance of kathakali music,"in rhythm: the singer has to keep his eyes riveted on the actor, for every little body movement has to synchronise with the gong beat. , one of the most evolved art forms, music for kathakali, is often inadequately understood by carnatic music aficionados who normally compare it with grammar and rules that apply to their own music and find it lacking. music as a vachika element in kathakali is designed entirely to enable and enhance characterisation, and not primarily for expressing classical virtuosity. though kathakali music ragas are largely from the carnatic genre, there are ragas special to it and not known to carnatic singing and even those common to carnatic music in usage and ‘prayog’ for this dance drama form follow an individualistic mode., in the 19th century, travancore had only the sopanam style of singing as a continuation of what was used in the earlier tradition of ramanattom. in central kerala, the tiruvilwamala and mottedattu schools of music were basically sopanam. it was only around 1910 that musician kavusseri masnu bhagavatar brought in the carnatic elements and this trend was popularised for kathakali by nemmara madhava menon and with the later venkatakrishna bhagavatar, the carnatic music element increased to include raga alapana., but while the raga is often carnatic, the very slow tempo in which it is sung is certainly a regional element. in fact the “chembada tala chauka kalai’ singing which requires phenomenal voice and breath control to hold each moment of a note that much longer, without in any way lessening the flow and continuity of melody, is not easy for any singer to master. one understands the need for two singers, one main and the other who takes up the refrain from where it is left off. along with this almost boneless suppleness of voice full of emotion, a mastery over rhythm, both inherent and acquired is a must, for the singer keeps time with his beat on the gong (if the main singer) and with cymbals (for the second singer)., sense of timing, also the singer has to keep his eyes riveted on the actor for every little body movement has to synchronise with the gong beat. so adept are experienced singers that every nuance of a moving facial muscle is anticipated and synchronised with the gong rhythm. the training of a singer for kathakali is in conjunction with a performing actor, after the ‘janteswara’, etc., training like it is for the carnatic singer. after varnam, the next step of learning singing of padams from various attakalaris or plays, are in conjunction with a kathakali performer. the singer has to control the performance, its tempo and also the percussionists by his acute sense of timing. the raga used is entirely governed by the mood and character and unlike carnatic music where a kambodhi would not be followed almost immediately by a yadukula kambodhi, or a husseni or mukhari or even anandabhairavi would not follow a bhairavi rendition, kathakali music has no such qualms, for if the mood demands a certain raga, its following soon after another raga very close to it, is no restricting factor. unlike other dance forms which for abhinaya delight in using lyrics interpreting love in separation (viniyoga), kathakali revels in sambhoga sringar situations where the hero and his beloved are lost in contemplation of each other’s beauty. nalacharitam’s “kuvalaya volochane, bale, bhaimi, kisalayaadhare, charuseele” where nala addresses his wife joyfully describing every detail of her physical attributes, rendered in mandara sthayi in two avartans (rhythmic cycles) of adanta tala – the first tempo in 56 matras, moves so slowly that the really accomplished singer can add a nectarine quality with his melody and words inspiring the best out of the hero. as the eyes of the actor move to each aspect of damayanthi being described, the singer has to keep in pace – which is why kathakali experts very often price the singer more for his conducting ability than for his melodious rendition – though a wailing high-pitched singing in bhairavi or todi can create goose pimples in the listener., no pause!, apart from the slow singing which is very difficult to master, the fluidity takes years to acquire. unlike classical musicians, a kathakali musician goes from raga to raga with no pause. the singer rendering in natakuranji “devi sukhamo” as hanuman falls at the feet of sita when he is led to the ashram by lava and kusha in “lavanasuravadham” is heart rending for audiences. ragas like padi (not from mayamalavagowla as janya but from harikambhoji), puraneer, indalam, begada ragam sung using madhyama sruti, navaroz are special to kathakali natyasangeet. so also ragas are used for moods they are normally not associated with in carnatic music as neelambari used for raudra and veera rasa as against a lullaby or similar mood in carnatic music. similarly, ahiri is used for veera mood rather than karuna. in a scene showing krishna reasoning with duryodhana to hand over some part of the kingdom to the pandavas after completing the period of exile, duryodhana’s belligerence in begada and krishna’s pleading tone in senjurutti make a wonderful contrast heightening the dramatic tension.",0.1279741727199354,nuance kathakali music,"rhythm : singer keep eyes riveted actor , every little

2010-10-21,what the uid conceals,"fingerprint impression is taken on a digital machine at a special booth set up for the proof of concept phase of the unique identification project at patancheru in medak district, on march 30, 2010. photo: nagara gopal | photo credit: nagara gopal , is identity the “missing link” in india's efforts to rise as an “inclusive” economic superpower? can an identity-linked and technology-based solution change the face of governance in india? given the euphoria around the unique identification (uid) project, one is tempted to believe so. however, a careful look at the project would show that the euphoria is just hyperbole; only the politically naïve can afford to ignore the far-reaching implications of this orwellian project., one can summarise the criticisms of the uid project under four heads. first, the project would necessarily entail the violation of privacy and civil liberties of people. second, it remains unclear whether biometric technology — the cornerstone of the project – is capable of the gigantic task of de-duplication. the unique identification authority of india's (uidai) “biometrics standards committee” has noted that retaining biometric efficiency for a database of more than one billion persons “has not been adequately analysed” and the problem of fingerprint quality in india “has not been studied in depth”. third, there has been no cost-benefit analysis or feasibility report for the project till now. finally, the purported benefits of the project in the social sector, such as in the public distribution system (pds), are largely illusive. the problem of duplicate ration cards is often hugely exaggerated. even so, some states have largely eliminated duplicate ration cards using “lower” technologies like hologram-enabled ration cards., in this larger context, the uid project has two distinct political dimensions. the first dimension is that the project is fundamentally linked to “national security” concerns rather than “developmental” concerns. in fact, the marketing team of the uidai has always been on an overdrive to hush up the security angle, and play up the developmental angle, to render it more appealing., the first phase of today's uid project was initiated in 1999 by the nda government in the wake of the kargil war. following the reports of the “kargil review committee” in 2000, and a group of ministers in 2001, the nda government decided to compulsorily register all citizens into a “national population register” (npr) and issue a multi-purpose national identity card (mnic) to each citizen. to ease this process, clauses related to individual privacy in the citizenship act of 1955 were weakened through an amendment in 2003. in sum, the ground work for a national id project was completed by 2003 itself., the parallels between the upa's uid and the nda's mnic are too evident to be missed, even as the upa sells uid as a purely “developmental” initiative. the former chief of the intelligence bureau, a.k. doval, almost gave it away recently, when he said that uid, originally, “was intended to wash out the aliens and unauthorised people. but the focus appears to be shifting. now, it is being projected as more development-oriented, lest it ruffle any feathers”., the potential of the project to unleash a security frenzy is the reason why privacy concerns have to be taken seriously. the government and the uidai have made it appear as if the purported, and unsubstantiated, benefits of “good governance” from the project eclipse the concerns regarding privacy and civil liberties. this is where the problem lies. a foundational understanding in the study of individual freedoms, pioneered by scholars like amartya sen, is that consequence-independent absolute rights are rather hard to defend. hence, the demand to trade-off one freedom for another (here, the “invasive loss” of privacy for “development”) is an untenable demand. each freedom, independently, has an instrumental value, and the loss of one freedom undermines the individual's overall capability to expand up on other freedoms. no wonder then that sen himself has voiced the privacy concern regarding the uid project., there is a related concern: police and security forces, if allowed access to the biometric database, could extensively use it for regular surveillance and investigative purposes, leading to a number of human rights violations. as amartya sen has argued elsewhere, forced disclosure and loss of privacy always entailed “the social costs of the associated programmes of investigation and policing”. according to him, “some of these investigations can be particularly nasty, treating each applicant as a potential criminal.”, the second dimension of the uid project is the following: it would qualitatively restructure the role of the state in the social sector. contrary to claims, the uid project is not an instrument to expand india's social security system, for whatever it is worth. instead, the aim is to keep benefits restricted to the so-called “targeted” sections, ensure targeting with precision and thereby, limit the government's expenditure commitments. none other than the prime minister has made this amply clear. addressing the national development council (ndc) on july 24, 2010, he noted: “to reduce our fiscal deficit in the coming years, … we must be … reducing the scale of untargeted subsidies. the operationalisation of the unique identification number scheme … provides an opportunity to target subsidies effectively.”, the uidai claims that uid would help the government shift from a number of indirect benefits into direct benefits. in reality, such a shift would represent the opposite: a transformation of the role of the state from a direct provider to an indirect provider. for the uidai, the uid is a tool of empowerment. in reality, the uid would be an alibi for the state to leave the citizen unmarked in the market for social services. nowhere is the illustration more telling than in the case of the pds., let me state the argument upfront. the uid project is part of a larger effort to dismantle the pds in india. the aim is to ensure a back-door entry of food stamps in the place of pds, and later graduate it to a cash transfer scheme, thereby completing the state's withdrawal from the sphere of food procurement and distribution., according to the uidai, the most important benefit from the uid could be that you could have a “portable” pds. in other words, you could have a system where you (say, a migrant worker) could buy your pds quota from anywhere in india. the claim, of course, has a deceptive appeal. one would have to dig deeper to grasp the real intent., if we take the present fair price shop (fps) system, each fps has a specified number of households registered to it. the fps stores grains only for the registered households. the fps owner would not know how many migrants, and for what periods, would come in and demand their quota. hence, for lack of stock, he would turn away migrant workers who demand grains. hence, the fps system is incompatible with the uid-linked portability of pds. there is only one way out: do away with the fps system, accredit grocery shops to sell grains, allow them to compete with each other and allow the shop owners to get the subsidy reimbursed. this is precisely what food stamps are all about; no fps, you get food stamps worth an amount, go to any shop and buy grains (on why food stamps are deeply problematic, see madhura swaminathan, “targeted food stamps”, the hindu, august 3, 2004)., what is interesting is that everyone, except those enamoured by the uid glitter, appears to know this. on its part, uidai officially accepts that food stamps become easier to implement with the uid. so does the planning commission, which sees the uid as the fulcrum around which its plans to “reform” the pds revolve. it turns out that an opposition to the dismantling of pds, and to food stamps, also involves an opposition to the uid., on his part, nandan nilekani has been showcasing his extraordinarily poor understanding of india's developmental priorities. according to him, “in the indira years, the slogan was garibi hatao. then it was roti, kapda, makaan. in the last few years, it was bijli, sadak, pani.” however, these slogans are “passé”; the in-thing is the slogan “uid number, bank account, mobile phone.” such an inverted world view, totally divorced from the grim realities of poverty, has prompted critics to call aadhaar as just niraadhaar!",0.08369565217391302,uid conceals,"fingerprint impression taken digital machine special booth set proof concept phase unique identification project patancheru medak district , march 30 ,

of the driving licence with the unique identification number to be issued by the uidai., categories redefined, to ensure better driving and road safety, there will be different categories of licences. the committee has redefined the categories of vehicles and the classes of vehicles against each category, and suggested the need for a specific authorisation to use a vehicle for a specific purpose. a two-stage procedure has been suggested for grant of the licence and subsequent authorisation where necessary., under the proposed law, the validity of a driving licence for a non-transport vehicle will be for 20 years or until the holder attains the age of 50. it could be renewed every five years till the age of 70 and thereafter renewal will be based on medical certificate., for a transport vehicle, the driving licence will be for three years and it will be renewed thereafter for periods of five years., the committee has suggested portability of registration numbers allowing the original

2011-06-29,pm's opening remarks at the interaction with newspaper editors,"june 29, 2011, new delhi, i think that there is a growing perception that this government is in siege, that we have not been able to deliver on our agenda. an atmosphere has been created in the country - and this i say with all humility – the role of the media today in many cases has become that of the accuser, the prosecutor and the judge., now that way no parliamentary democracy can function and i would like to tell you that if you are taking governmental decisions, particularly big macro decisions, we don't know all the facts and yet we have to take decisions. when i was a student at cambridge, sir paul chambers, who was then the chairman of imperial chemical industries, came and addressed us on who is a good manager, who will be considered by industry as a good manager., he told our student group that, in an uncertain world in which we live in, if 5 out of 10 decisions that i take ex-ante turn out to be correct ex-post that would be considered as a job well done. if out of 10 decisions that i take, 7 turn out to be right ex-post that would be considered an excellent performance. but if you have a system which is required to perform 10 out of 10 cases i think no system can be effective and satisfy that onerous condition., we live in a world of uncertainty and ex-post whether it is the comptroller and auditor general, whether it is a parliamentary committee then they analyse post facto. they have a lot more facts which were not available to those who took the decision., i am not saying that it is not possible that some people may deliberately do wrong things, but in many cases it would turn out in that sort of a scenario it is very difficult to operate. so we must create in this country an environment in which governments, ministers and civil servants will not be discouraged from taking decisions in the national interest when all facts are not known, they will never be known. we take decisions in a world of uncertainty and that’s the perspective i think parliament, our cag and our media must adopt if this nation is to move forward., our basic task is to deal with poverty, ignorance and disease which still afflict millions and millions of our citizens and whatever the ideological moorings of different parties, there is nobody who would say that you can satisfy all these aspirations of the people except in the framework of a rapidly expanding economy which is able to create 10 to 12 million jobs. for this, we need skilled citizens and we need to put in place a system of skill formation in education which is going to create employable skills which alone can provide our people the security of jobs that they need., we have put in place an entitlement system. entitlements have a role, but quite frankly there is a limited role. in the institutions of social security that we are trying to build, there are a large number of leakages in health, in education, and the allocation of subsidies. our challenge is to plug these leaks and we will do that., corruption is a big issue. it has caught the imagination of the people, and we will deal with it. let me say that while the lokpal is an essential and desirable legislation, we will honestly work to evolve a broad based national consensus so that we have a viable statute in place which will give us a strong lokpal. we have differences, there will be differences, but there are mechanisms to resolves these differences., i certainly respect members of the civil society. it is out of my respect for members of the civil society that whether it is anna hazare or swami ramdev, i myself took the trouble to interact with them. in february-march itself i had an hour long meeting with anna hazare, the bhushans, both father and son, kejriwal and kiran bedi. they were all there and i assured them that we are committed to come with the bill in the monsoon session and it was not a commitment made under duress. i had mentioned it to them at that time itself. i said we will introduce a bill in parliament but then it is for parliament to pass it or amend it and that right cannot be taken away., in the same way people talk about black money. black money exists, but if you look at all european countries also the average amount of black money which is talked about is at least 25 % of the economies of a large number of european countries. these are transactions that are not taxed and intended to avoid social security payments. but this is a reality. we can deal with corruption, we can deal with black money but quite frankly it is wrong for anyone to assume there is a magic wand which will lead to an instant solution of these difficult societal problems., we need system reforms. if the project nandan nilankani has promised to design, if the uidai can give unique id numbers to all our residents we would have discovered a new pathway to eliminate the scope for corruption and leakages in the management and distribution of various subsidies to which our people are entitled. but it will take time. it cannot be done instantly., 4 lakh crores or whatever the figures or black money being mentioned…… i do not know what is the basis of those calculations. whatever is possible is being done. we are in the process of negotiating double taxation avoidance agreements, tax information agreements and we have fought hard in the group of 20 to see that the secrecy of tax saving banking systems should be modified. this is not a one shot operation. we are doing all that is possible and we could accelerate it. we are committed to pursue all that is fiscally possible to deal with these problems of black money, problems of tax evading money and corruption., but there are other instruments. tax evasion is one important source of generation of black money. but there are other issues - narcotics, trafficking in human beings - all these illegal activities…. we need a strong mechanism to track down these criminal elements. but in all these my worry is to avoid a situation when we convert this vast country of over 1.2 billion people into a state where everybody is policing everybody else. we must not bring back the license permit raj which we sought to abolish in 1991., i think our nation has prospered as a result of that. if you look at the list of top 100 firms today you will find a sea change in that list today. new entrepreneurs have come into the list. these are some of the gains of liberalization which we must cherish, we must nurse and we must develop., we are committed to a growth rate of 9 to 10 % per annum. our savings rate is about 34 to 35 % of our gdp with an investment rate of 36 to 37 %. and with a capital output ratio of 4:1 we can manage to have a growth rate of 9%. it requires strong commitment to development and modernization of our infrastructure; a strong commitment to modernizing and making our education system more relevant to the needs of our time; it requires strong commitment to work for a universal health care system. we are now engaged in looking at how insurance can be expanded to cover all elements of our population., these are some of the priorities of our government. but frankly speaking in our country this constant sniping between government and opposition or if an atmosphere of cynicism is created all round i think the growth impulses, the entrepreneurial impulses of our people will not flourish and that is what worries me. we must do all that we can to revive the animal spirits of our businesses. and the fact that businessmen cut corners is partly a reflection of the loopholes in our regulatory system. we must therefore reform and strengthen the regulatory system where there is a need to do so. and when it comes to the management of natural resources we need a regulatory system but it must be transparent and it must be functional and that is the next step of our government., despite corruption in public procurement we are committed to work towards a public procurement law which will make procurement a transparent operation, and will eliminate to the extent possible the scope for corruption., but in the situation that we are faced today, day in day out i think we are described as the most corrupt government. there have been aberrations. but quite frankly i have been a civil servant all my life, except the last 20 years. what surprises me is not that there are corrupt civil servants but that despite all the temptations, so many of our civil servants remain honest and lead frugal lives and this is the mainspring that we have to tap., we must punish the wrong doers but we must not paint all civil servants as babus and contemptuously describe them as a despicable class., these are the concerns that i have and i would like to hear from you what you think of them and what we should be doing., and let me say on the international front i think the situation is not that positive. the international global recovery is fragile. even the united states growth rate is faltering. in europe it is the sovereign debt crisis, the problem of the greek crisis and whether the euro-zone will survive or not. if it will not survive it will be a major institutional collapse., what is happening in the middle east is of direct concern to us. apart from the fact that we have 6 million indians working in the middle east nearly 70 % of our oil supplies come from the countries of the gulf and north africa. what turn these events will take nobody knows., so we have to swim against this adverse tide and therefore india requires all the energy and all the cohesiveness of our polity to swim against these tides and come out victorious. we can do it. we showed that in 2008 when most people believed that our financial system would also be a victim of the global financial crisis. we put in place correctives and we managed to retain a growth rate of 7% and next year it was back to 8 to 8.5 %. we must have the vision, the ability and the determination to prosper even when the world environment is hostile., and because nature has blessed us with a large common market, if we can put in place the goods and services tax legislation and if we can remove barriers to interstate commerce that itself will create new opportunities internally for accelerating the tempo of

david blunkett even called it not an “identity card,” but an “entitlement card.” third, mr. blair argued that the card would protect citizens from “terrorism” and “identity fraud.” for this, the biometric technology was projected as infallible., all these claims were questioned by scholarly and public opinion. a meticulous report from the london school of economics examined each claim and rejected them (see “high-cost, high-risk,” frontline, august 14, 2009). this report argued that the government was making the card compulsory across such a wide range of schemes that it would, de facto, become compulsory. it also argued that the card would not end identity fraud in entitlement schemes. the reason: biometrics was not a reliable method of de-duplication., the indian discourse around aadhaar is remarkably similar. almost identical arguments are forwarded in support of the project to provide a population of over one billion people with uid numbers. i argue that aadhaar, just as its failed counterpart in the u.k., is promoted from a platform of myths. here, there is space for three big myths only., myth 1: aadhaar number is not mandatory., this is wrong; aadhaar has stealthily been made mandatory. aadhaar is explicitly linked to the preparation of the npr. the census of india website notes that “data collected in the npr will be subjected to de-duplication by the uidai unique identification authority of india. after de-duplication, the uidai will issue a uid number. this uid number will be part of the npr and the npr cards will bear this uid number.”, the npr is the creation of an amendment in 2003 to the citizenship act of 1955. as per rule 3(3) in the citizenship rules of 2003, information on every citizen in the national register of indian citizens should compulsorily have his/her “national identity number.” again, rule 7(3) states that “it shall be the responsibility of every citizen to register once with the local registrar of citizen registration and to provide correct individual particulars.” still further, rule 17 states that “any violation of provisions of rules 5, 7, 8, 10, 11 and 14 shall be punishable with fine which may extend to one thousand rupees.”, the conclusion is simple: aadhaar has been made compulsory, even before passing the bill concerned in parliament. under the project's guise, the state is coercing individuals to part with personal information; this coercion comes with a threat of punishment., myth 2: aadhaar is just like the social security number (ssn) in the united states., there is a world of difference between the ssn and aadhaar. the ssn was introduced in the u.s. in 1936 to facilitate provision of social security benefits. a defining feature of ssn is that it is circumscribed by the privacy act of 1974. this act states that “it shall be unlawful for any…government agency to deny to any individual any right, benefit, or privilege provided by law because of such individual's refusal to disclose his social security account number.” further, federal agencies have to provide notice to, and obtain consent from, individuals before disclosing their ssns to third parties., the ssn was never conceived as an identity document. however, in the 2000s, ssn began to be used widely for proving one's identity at different delivery/access points. as a result, ssns of individuals were exposed to a wide array of private players, which identity thieves used to access bank accounts, credit accounts, utilities records and other sources of personal information. in 2006, the government accountability office noted that “over a 1-year period, nearly 10 million people — or 4.6 per cent of the adult u.s. population — discovered that they were victims of some form of identity theft, translating into estimated losses exceeding $50 billion.”, following public outcry, the president appointed a task force on identity theft in 2007. acting on its report, the president notified a plan: “combating identity theft: a strategic plan.” this plan directed all government offices to “eliminate unnecessary uses of ssns” and reduction and, where possible, elimination of the need to use ssn to identify individuals. it's quite the contrary in india. according to nandan nilekani, aadhaar number would become “ubiquitous”; he has even advised people to “tattoo it somewhere,” lest they forget it!, myth 3: identity theft can be eliminated using biometrics., there is consensus among scientists and legal experts regarding the limitations of biometrics in proving identity. first, no accurate information exists on whether the errors of matching fingerprints are negligible or non-existent. a small percentage of users would always be either falsely matched or not matched at all against the database., second, errors of matching would stand significantly amplified in countries like india. a report from 4g identity solutions, contracted by uidai for supply of biometric devices, notes that:, “it is estimated that approximately five per cent of any population has unreadable fingerprints, either due to scars or aging or illegible prints. in the indian environment, experience has shown that the failure to enrol is as high as 15 per cent due to the prevalence of a huge population dependent on manual labour.”, a 15 per cent failure rate would mean the exclusion of over 200 million people. if fingerprint readers are installed at mahatma gandhi national rural employment guarantee scheme (mnregs) work sites and ration shops, and employment or purchases made contingent on correct authentication, about 200 million persons would remain permanently excluded from accessing such schemes., the report of the uidai's “biometrics standards committee” actually accepts these concerns as real. its report notes that “fingerprint quality, the most important variable for determining de-duplication accuracy, has not been studied in depth in the indian context.” however, this critical limitation of the technology has not prevented the government from leaping into the dark with this project, one whose cost would exceed rs.50,000 crore.",0.020686895409117625,aadhaar : platform myths,"new delhi : 25/01/2011 : women showing unique id cards given delhi cm mark lauch "" aadhar ' scheme occassion republic day celebration , new delhi january 25,2011. photo : sushil kumar verma &#124;

2011-07-22,food security bill needs amendments,"new delhi : activists protesting at the planning commission office against the national food security bill and recommendations of tendulkar committee, as the empowered group of ministers (egom) on food hold its meeting in new delhi on monday. pti photo(pti5_23_2011_000209a) , the food security bill finalised by a group of ministers should not be accepted by parliament in its present form. the overriding negative features of the proposed legislation far outweigh its positive initiatives. the framework itself is questionable since the central government usurps all powers to decide the numbers, criteria and schemes while imposing a substantial level of expenditure on the state governments. far from meeting the basic requirements for a universalised system of public distribution, it actually deprives people and also state governments of existing rights on several counts — in spite of the opportunity created through huge buffer stocks., first, it cuts down on the number of eligible households. at the chief ministers' conference in february 2010, the government's agenda paper gave the total number of apl (above poverty line) and bpl (below poverty line) households covered by the targeted public distribution system as 18.03 crore. this works out to over 90 per cent of the population, calculated on the basis of the population projections used by the central government. but the bill sets a cap of 75 per cent households in rural india and just 50 per cent in urban india. this means that lakhs of families holding apl cards will be excluded from the pds., second, the bill ignores the state government estimations of bpl families. as opposed to 6.52 crore families recognised by the central government as being poor, state governments, based on their own estimation, have extended bpl coverage to 11.03 crore households, comprising 56 per cent of the population. but the bill puts a cap on bpl households at 46 per cent in the rural areas and just 28 per cent in the urban areas., at the heart of the differences between the centre and many states on this issue is the utterly inhuman poverty line determined by the planning commission, which was rs. 13 for an adult in rural india and rs. 18 in urban india. and it was fraudulently linked with poverty “quotas” or “caps.” the bill legalises this anti-poor framework through section 13(1), which states: “the central government shall, for each state determine the number of persons belonging to the priority (bpl) households.” in this, the bill prepared by the national advisory council (nac) provides the government an alibi. section 21 of the nac draft states that the identification of priority households will “be based on the criteria notified by the central government.” it is unfortunate that the nac members who lead the right-to-food campaign should have accepted such a flawed policy. it surely undermines their own campaign., third, it cuts down on allocations. the bill shifts from the present quota of 35 kg per family to an individual-based system fixed at a monthly quota of 7 kg per person for a bpl family. while individual-based quotas may appear to be reasonable, it will end up punishing poor families that have fewer children. for example, in a state like kerala where the average family size is smaller than elsewhere in the country, the present quota of 35 kg will be cut, say for a bpl family with four members, to 28 kg. it would have been fairer to have kept the minimum allocation at 35 kg for a family and increased it by a certain amount per additional person over an average of five members per family. for apl sections it is even worse, with just a 3-kg quota per individual. can 3 kg a month provide food security? this is an affront to human dignity and shows an utter lack of social conscience. also, it needs to be clarified whether a child would have the same entitlement as an adult has., the fourth issue is that of prices. around 10 state governments have established a system where bpl families get rice at rs. 2 a kg. in tamil nadu, rice is being provided at re. 1 a kg and to some sections free of cost. the bill ignores these existing price benefits. in the bill, the price of rice for bpl families is rs. 3, not rs. 2 a kg. however, the price of wheat has been kept at rs. 2 a kg and that of millets at rs. 1 a kg. but the central government has the right to change these prices at any time. for apl cardholders, schedule 1 of the bill pegs the price of foodgrains at 50 per cent of the minimum support price (msp) given to farmers for wheat and rice. instead of a fixed price as at present, apl prices are bound to move upwards given the farmers' genuine demand to raise the msp every year to cover higher input costs. thus the bill creates a division and a possible conflict between consumers and farmers. while the farmers demand a higher msp, the apl cardholders' interests will come to lie in lower msps., the bill has a section on reforms that takes forward the government's neo-liberal agenda. chapter 13, section 3(g), of the bill states: “introducing scheme for cash transfer to the targeted beneficiaries in lieu of their foodgrain entitlements… in areas and manner to be prescribed by the central government.” this is in tune with the recommendation made by the world bank in its recent analysis of social protection schemes in india. thus the cash transfer scheme opposed by a large number of food experts is made mandatory. the state governments are given no choice., it also links the right to food with the questionable aadhar, or unique identification system based on biometric information. clause 3 of the same chapter mentions “leveraging aadhaar for unique identification with biometric information of entitled beneficiaries for proper targeting under this act.” the main problem of corruption in the pds is not impersonation — which is what the uid seeks to address — but diversion and leakages to private traders. the technology is admittedly prone to serious errors. in india, a country with a large number of manual labourers, it has been estimated that the error could go up to 15 to 20 per cent. to make food security rights conditional on biometric proof would be to use another instrument of exclusion., there are some positive features in the bill including the inclusion of the mid-day meal scheme in its ambit. there are good provisions for nutritional guarantees in the form of a cooked meal for pregnant and lactating women, including for mothers for six months after childbirth. these are universal free-of-cost benefits. there are other schemes proposed for community kitchens for destitute persons, for migrant workers and special provisions for groups or communities identified as victims of starvation. however, disabled persons are once again left out., but where will the funds come from? according to the bill, the entire payment for all these free schemes proposed by the central government will have to be made by the state government. since the largest number of poor people reside in precisely those states where there are very limited resources, expecting the state governments to bear the huge expenditures is unjust and unfair. already the right to education legislation is facing serious hurdles, one of these being the lack of resources at the state level. the food bill will become a victim of the same lack of resources syndrome if the present framework for expenses is not drastically changed.",0.04447036243152748,food security bill needs amendments,"new delhi : activists protesting planning commission office national food security bill recommendations tendulkar committee , empowered group ministers ( egom ) food hold meeting new delhi monday. pti photo( pti5_23_2011_000209a ) , food security bill finalised group ministers accepted parliament present form. overriding negative features proposed legislation far outweigh positive initiatives. framework questionable since central government usurps powers decide numbers , criteria schemes imposing substantial level expenditure state governments. far meeting basic requirements universalised system public distribution , actually deprives people also state governments existing rights several counts — spite opportunity created huge buffer stocks. , first , cuts number eligible households. chief ministers ' conference february 2010 , government ' agenda paper gave total number apl ( poverty line ) bpl ( poverty line ) households covered targeted public distribution system 18.03 crore. works 90 per cent population , calculated basis population projections used central government. bill sets cap 75 per cent households rural india 50 per cent urban india. means lakhs families holding apl cards excluded pds. , second , bill ignores state government estimations bpl families. opposed 6.52 crore families recognised central government poor , state governments , based estimation , extended bpl coverage 11.03 crore households , comprising 56 per cent population. bill puts cap bpl households 46 per cent rural areas 28 per cent urban areas. , heart differences centre many states issue utterly inhuman poverty line determined planning commission , rs. 13 adult rural india rs. 18 urban india. fraudulently linked poverty “quotas ” “caps. ” bill legalises anti-poor framework section 13( 1 ) , states : “the central government shall , state determine number persons belonging priority ( bpl ) households. ” , bill prepared national advisory council ( nac ) provides government alibi. section 21 nac draft states identification priority households “be based criteria notified central government. ” unfortunate nac members lead right-to-food campaign accepted flawed policy. surely undermines campaign. , third , cuts allocations. bill shifts present quota 35 kg per family individual-based system fixed monthly quota 7 kg per person bpl family. individual-based quotas may appear reasonable , end punishing poor families fewer children. example , state like kerala average family size smaller elsewhere country , present quota 35 kg cut , say bpl family four members , 28 kg. would fairer kept minimum allocation 35 kg family increased certain amount per additional person average five members per family. apl sections even worse , 3-kg quota per individual. 3 kg month provide food security ?

leading cybersecurity expert r. bhaskar says., “the facility is ambitious and is sure to make functioning easy from the governance perspective. but at the moment, it is not clear how the government’s plan for uid will work out,” bhaskar told ians., “there is some kind of certification or guarantee needed from companies that are pooling the database or will be handling it,” he said on the sidelines of a seminar on cyberspace and democracy at the india international centre here., uids, the upa government’s flagship programme chaired by nandan nilekani, seeks to accord each indian a unique identification number., the unique identification authority of india (uidai) is the nodal agency which has appointed registrars across the country to facilitate the enrolment process. registrars, typically government departments and public sector organisations, have in turn appointed the agency to collect data., over 200 such agencies, including wipro, comat technologies, alankit and virgo softech, are involved in enrollment and will issue a 12—digit number., within the proposed process, it is to be delivered in 20—30 days at the person’s address by speed post, after verification of biometrics and demographic data. data verification is done by the authority under a centralised system., “the immediate threat may not be realised now. but in a span of next five years, when the cards will be rolled out completely, we may also witness cases of cyber mischief such as hacking,” bhaskar said., he further warned that cyber-mischief may also evolve into cyber-crime that poses serious threat to country’s national security., while the uid guarantees uniqueness and a universal identity through a centralised online identity verification process, experts point out that biometric information such as iris scan and fingerprinting lead to a misuse of an individual’s personal information., experts have also raised concerns on the number getting misused by anti—socials such as

2011-12-16,aadhaar: time to disown the idea,"in this file photo, a man records his identity with an iris scanner for obtaining the aadhar card, at the head post office in madurai. parliament's standing committee on finance has raised serious questions about the idea of aadhaar. | photo credit: the hindu , “…the committee categorically convey their unacceptability of the national identification authority of india bill, 2010…the committee would, thus, urge the government to reconsider and review the uid scheme.…”, this was the conclusion of parliament's standing committee on finance (scof), which examined the bill to convert the unique identification authority of india (uidai) into a statutory authority. with this categorical rebuff, the scof dealt a body blow to the aadhaar project, which is being implemented from september 2010 without parliament's approval., technically speaking, the scof report asked the government to bring forth fresh legislation before parliament. however, a careful examination of the report shows that it does not just reject the bill, it also raises serious questions about the idea of aadhaar itself. in fact, the report so comprehensively questions the idea that any effort to introduce fresh legislation would require, as a prerequisite, a re-look at the foundational principles on which the project was conceived., there are broadly five important arguments in the scof report., first, it contains scathing criticism of the government for beginning aadhaar enrolment without parliament's approval for the bill. currently, uidai enjoys only executive authority, and no statutory authority. the justification that the government presented before the scof was as follows: the powers of the executive are co-extensive with the legislative powers of the government, and this allows the government to exercise executive powers in spheres not regulated by legislation., the government also cited the attorney-general's advice, which noted that “executive power operates independently” of parliament and that “there is nothing in law that prevents the uidai from functioning under the executive authorisation.”, the scof rejects this position, and states that the government's legal justification “does not satisfy the committee.” the legal position upheld by the scof is that co-extensiveness of powers does not permit the executive to do what it pleases; when constitutional rights and protections are potentially violated, the powers of the executive remain circumscribed by those of the legislature., secondly, the scof raises serious questions about the enrolment process followed for aadhaar numbers. the issue of aadhaar numbers “is riddled with serious lacunae,” and this problem can be traced to conceptualisation “with no clarity of purpose” and implementation in “a directionless way with a lot of confusion.” for instance, the ministry of finance felt that there was “lack of coordination” across the six agencies collecting personal information, leading to “duplication of efforts and expenditure.” the ministry of home raised “serious security concerns” over the introducer model used to enrol persons without any proof of residence., the report concludes that the enrolment process “compromises the security and confidentiality of information of aadhaar number holders,” and has “far reaching consequences for national security.” the reason: “the possibility of possession of aadhaar numbers by illegal residents through false affidavits/introducer system.”, thirdly, the scof comes down heavily on the government for proceeding with the project without “enactment of a national data protection law,” which is a “pre-requisite for any law that deals with large-scale collection of information from individuals and its linkages across separate databases.”, in its submission to the scof, the government had taken a dismissive view of the right to privacy of individuals. it noted that “collection of information without a privacy law in place does not violate the right to privacy of the individual.” the scof rejects this view, and notes that in the absence of legislation for data protection, “it would be difficult to deal with the issues like access and misuse of personal information, surveillance, profiling, linking and matching of databases and securing confidentiality of information.”, fourthly, the report strongly disapproves of “the hasty manner” in which the project was cleared. it concludes that a “comprehensive feasibility study…ought to have been done before approving such an expensive scheme.” this conclusion follows the government's admission to the scof that “no committee has been constituted to study the financial implications of the uid scheme,” and that “comparative costs of the aadhaar number and various existing id documents are also not available.”, the total cost of the aadhaar project would run into multiples of ten thousand crore of rupees. for just phase 1 and 2, where 10 crore residents were to be enrolled, the allocation was rs. 3,170 crore. for phase 3, where another 10 crore residents are to be enrolled, the allocation is rs. 8,861 crore. in a rough extrapolation, for 120 crore residents the total cost would then be over rs. 72,000 crore. is the comptroller and auditor general listening?, fifthly, the report tears apart the faith placed on biometrics to prove the unique identity of individuals. it notes that “the scheme is full of uncertainty in technology” and is built upon “untested, unreliable technology.” it criticises the uidai for disregarding (a) the warnings of its biometrics standards committee about high error rates in fingerprint collection; (b) the inability of proof of concept studies to promise low error rates when 1.2 billion persons are enrolled; and (c) the reservations within the government on “the necessity of collection of iris image.” the report concludes that, given the limitations of biometrics, “it is unlikely that the proposed objectives of the uid scheme could be achieved.”, the scof report cites the experience from the united kingdom, where a similar id scheme was shelved. it dismisses the government's contention that “comparison between developed countries…versus india…is not a reasonable one.” it states that “there are lessons from the global experience to be learnt,” which the government has “ignored completely.” it cites issues of cost overruns, fallacies of technology and risks to the safety of citizens, and notes: “as these findings are very much relevant and applicable to the uid scheme, they should have been seriously considered.”, the scof report has invited sharp reactions from the business press and pro-business lobbies. one report argued that, after the foreign direct investment-in-retail fiasco, it is “another indian reform massacre;” for another, it is a “setback to the government's attempts to revive faltering economic reforms;” and for yet another, the title was “upa reforms agenda hit again.”, these predictable reactions only reaffirm the widely held belief that aadhaar is an integral component of the neo-liberal reform programme of upa-2. in fact, the scof deserves praise for standing up to pressure from powerful quarters, and not allowing the moment to be hijacked by vested interests. ironically, till last week, the same scof had come in for profuse praise from none other than nandan nilekani himself. he had said in august 2011: “i have had the occasion to…make a presentation on more than one occasion to the standing committee…let me tell you they do an extraordinarily thorough job. i am very, very impressed with the quality of questions, the homework, the due diligence, the seriousness that they view these things with. and it is very bipartisan, you can't make out who is from which party because they all ask on the issue. so when you have such an excellent system of law-making...let us respect that, let us give them the opportunity to call all the experts for and against and let them come out with something. they are the appropriate people, they are our representatives.”",0.028474541331684186,aadhaar : time disown idea,"file photo , man records identity iris scanner obtaining aadhar card , head post office madurai. parliament ' standing committee finance raised serious questions idea aadhaar. &#124;

2012-06-27,experiments with aadhaar,"within a few weeks of “aadhaar-enabled” payments of mahatma gandhi national rural employment guarantee scheme wages being initiated in jharkhand, earlier this year, glowing accounts of this experiment started appearing in the national media. some of them also gave the impression, intentionally or otherwise, that this successful experiment covered most of jharkhand. a fairly typical excerpt, which condenses five grand claims in a few lines, is as follows: “as the new system ensures payment of wages within a week, the demand for work under mgnregs has gone up. consequently, migration has been checked, families have been reunited and, no less important, some workers have a saving in the bank.”, enthused by these upbeat reports, we tried to trace the evidence behind them, but quickly reached a dead end. the authorities in ranchi referred us to the website of the unique identification authority of india (uidai), but we did not find any evaluation of the experiment there or, for that matter, any details of it. there was no alternative, it seemed, than to check the facts for ourselves., ratu block, we headed for the ratu block in ranchi district, the source of most of the reports. it was, at that time (early march), one of the five blocks where the experiment had been launched. on arrival, we found that only three gram panchayats (gps) were involved, out of 14 in ratu block. the showpiece appeared to be tigra gp, but it turned out that even there, only one worksite had enjoyed the blessings of aadhaar-enabled wage payments. in the three gps together, the system had been implemented at five worksites, employing a total of about 50 workers. we managed to interview 42 of them with the help of a small team of student volunteers., the main role of aadhaar in the jharkhand experiment is to facilitate the implementation of the “business correspondent” (bc) model. under this model, accredited agents provide doorstep banking services to mgnregs workers using a micro-atm. they act as extension counters of the local bank (in this case, bank of india), disbursing wages close to people’s homes. biometric authentication is meant to prevent identity fraud, e.g. someone’s wages being withdrawn by someone else. aadhaar is one possible foundation of biometric identification, though not the only one. in this approach, wages are paid through aadhaar-enabled accounts that are supposed to be opened at the time of uid enrolment. authentication requires internet connectivity, so that workers’ fingerprints and aadhaar numbers can be matched with the uidai’s central identities data repository., the bc model widens the reach of the banking system in rural areas. this, in turn, helps to bring more mgnregs workers under the umbrella of the banking system, as opposed to post offices, where corruption (including identify fraud) is a serious problem. doorstep banking facilities are also a significant convenience for workers in areas where bank offices are distant, overcrowded, or unfriendly., a little farcical, coming back to ratu, some aspects of the experiment were a little farcical. for instance, on one occasion, workers from tigra were asked to collect their wages 10 kilometres away, so that aadhaar-enabled payments could be done in front of a visiting minister. on a more positive note, the system seemed to work, at least under close supervision. further, most of the workers had a positive view of it. they appreciated being able to collect their wages closer to their homes, without the hassles of queuing in overcrowded banks or of depending on corrupt middlemen to extract their wages from the post office. they did not fully understand the new technology, but nor were they afraid or suspicious of it., having said this, there were problems too. dependence on fingerprint recognition, internet connectivity, and the goodwill of the bc created new vulnerabilities. fingerprint recognition problems alone affected 12 out of 42 respondents. some workers did not have a uid number, and some had a uid number but no aadhaar-enabled account. none of them had received bank passbooks, making it difficult for them to withdraw their wages from the bank when the aadhaar system failed., four respondents were yet to find a way of getting hold of their wages. otherwise, the payment of wages was reasonably timely, but this had more to do with intensive supervision than with aadhaar. it is important to understand that aadhaar, on its own, is of limited help in reducing delays in mgnregs wage payments. this is because the bulk of the delays occur before the banking system is involved — at the stage of submission of muster rolls, work measurement, preparation of payment advice, and so on. at every step, there is a lot of foot-dragging, and aadhaar is not the answer., (according to the mgnrega commissioner in jharkhand, quoted in one of the articles mentioned earlier, “against one month now, payments will reach workers’ accounts in one week.” this statement is typical of the delusional mindset of the jharkhand administration. not only are current delays much longer than one month, the claim that aadhaar will reduce them to one week has no basis.), nightmare, what next? it is easy to envisage a certain way of extending this experiment that would turn it into a nightmare for mgnregs workers. three steps would be a potent recipe for chaos: depriving mgnregs workers of bank passbooks, imposing the system even where there is no internet connectivity, and insisting on a single bank operating in each block (the odd “one block, one bank” rule). all this may seem far-fetched, but there are precedents of this sort of irresponsibility. short of this, if the aadhaar-based bc model is hastily extended without the system being ready (as happened earlier with the transition from cash to bank and post-office payments of mgnregs wages), it could easily compound rather than alleviate other sources of delays in wage payments., it is also possible to see a more constructive roll-out of the bc model across the country. in this constructive approach, the bc model would act as an additional facility for mgnregs workers, supplementing ordinary bank procedures instead of becoming a compulsory alternative. this would enable labourers to bypass the bc in cases of fingerprint recognition problems, or when the bc is corrupt or unreliable. for this purpose, the first step is to issue bank passbooks to mgnregs workers — this had not been done in ratu., the question remains whether aadhaar adds value to other versions of the bc model. in the adjacent block of itki, the bc model is being implemented without aadhaar, in partnership with fino, a private company. workers’ fingerprints are stored on a smart card, used for authentication and tamper-proof record-keeping. this obviates the need for internet connectivity, an important advantage of the itki system in areas like rural jharkhand., aadhaar, for its part, has two potential advantages. first, it facilitates multiple biometric applications based on single uid enrolment. second, aadhaar facilitates “inter-operability”, that is, linking of different uid-enabled databases. but the same features also have costs. for instance, dependence on a centralised enrolment system (as opposed to local biometrics) makes it much harder to correct or update the database, or to include workers who missed the initial enrolment drive. similarly, inter-operability raises a host of privacy and civil liberties issues. a brief exploratory visit to itki did not uncover any obvious reason to prefer the aadhaar system to local biometrics., poor cousin",0.06040396678151781,experiments aadhaar,"within

2012-07-13,"hardly unanimous, mr. thorat","gandhi in cartoons, navjivan trust , the debate over the cartoons used in ncert textbooks as aids to learning have thrown up a range of issues. the discussion has crystallised around a set of oppositions: motivated political correctness of our elected representatives vs. the necessity of preemptory parliamentary intervention on educational material appropriate for schools; institutional autonomy vs. political responsibility of a state presiding over a diverse and fraught society; the hubris of ‘experts’ vs. the right of others to feel hurt, in this case on solid rational grounds; the smugness of elite and upper caste votaries of a new pedagogy vs. the claims of those at the receiving end of hindu society (and history) to articulate unfamiliar adversarial intellectual positions; the celebration of the enabling learning curve of the ‘average’ schoolchild vs. the violence inflicted precisely by such homogenisations on the radically different life experiences of children from disadvantaged groups; the blindness of india’s ‘left liberals’ ensconced in their stockades vs. the insights of dalit writers and academics., the report of the cartoon committee, as it has come to be called, has brought forth a volley of criticisms and disclosures, along with a certain amount of fire-fighting by its chairman. in view of the start of the school session in july, the committee was given just one month to come up with its recommendations. some amount of sloppiness is bound to creep into a hurriedly drafted report. what sense can one make, critics say, of the suggestion: “the quotation” from the great urdu poet “faiz” may be given in urdu, and then it should be translated in three languages (hindi, english and urdu)”? or, for that matter, the stentorian but weak-kneed sentence: “the word “dalit” should be replaced by sc or it should be verified from legal sources.” what sort of political correctness is this which consigns a powerful ascriptive term of social identity to the waiting room of the law ministry, awaiting the nod of a joint secretary before it is allowed entry into class xi? critics have also berated the recommendation to delete a large number of cartoons from school books on ambiguous and spurious grounds., the committee, and especially its chairman, have drawn a good deal of flak for dealing with the views of the 13 subject experts consulted in a cavalier and patronising manner: “it is necessary to mention,” the report says, “that the views given by 13 experts were used by the committee as resource material after due consideration” (emphasis added). many of these experts have cried foul at the absence (expunging?) of their considered notes — even names — from the main body of the report. the chairman’s explanation given to a newspaper that ‘most experts did not want to be named’ seems a bit unconvincing., the most glaring omission is the excision of a note of dissent by one member of the committee on rather curious procedural grounds, arrived at in total disregard of the accepted practice in such matters. and this takes us to the way in which evidence tendered and contrarian views expressed were accommodated in the committees and commissions set up during the colonial period. take the famous hunter commission set up in october 1919 to investigate the punjab disturbances, the imposition of martial law and the notorious jallianwala bagh massacre of april of that year. headed by a scottish judge, lord hunter, it comprised a judge of the calcutta high court, a major general, a british merchant, and three indian lawyers, sir chinman lal setalvad, pt. jagat narayan and sultan ahmad khan. though all the members were critical of the actions of general dyer, the “butcher of amritsar” was grilled most severely by sir chinman lal, the distinguished legal luminary and vice chancellor of bombay university. we know this from the proceedings of the committee. the hunter commission which split down the middle on racial lines also produced six volumes of written and oral evidence that were tendered before it: unlike the cartoon committee of today, it did not “digest” this evidence in the process of producing an end product — a “unanimously arrived” report. and germane to the present controversy, the minority report of its three indian members, differing from the majority of its british members in condemning the imposition and the severity of the martial law in punjab, was published simultaneously along with the main report., had lord hunter followed the minimalist approach of prof. thorat and his committee members, our understanding of the ruthless ways of the raj would have been the poorer for it. to quote gandhi on the dissenting report of the indian members of the hunter commission: “the minority report stands out like an oasis in a desert. the indian members deserve the congratulation of their countrymen for having dared to do their duty in the face of heavy odds.” needless to say, in the structure of its power relations colonial india was radically different from the parliamentary india of today. what needs stressing is that a minority view can be productive of knowledge; unanimity, howsoever arrived at, and in the service of the most lofty of ideals can easily tip over into the land of intellectual sterility, where conformity rules and unreason thrives., or take again the education commission of 1882 which circulated a list of 70 questions for the benefit of the witnesses that appeared before it, and produced several volumes of evidence, indispensable for understanding the spread, limitations and possibilities of indigenous and western schooling. it is in these volumes that one encounters jyotibha phule’s condemnation of the casteist nature of our schools and the plea for compulsory primary education, or the views of syed ahmad khan and bhartendu harishchandra, the literary luminary of banaras, on the changing role of urdu and hindi in north indian society., colonial rule was a dispensation that, inter alia, ruled by record; a racial autocracy from which indians were excluded, it needed to document the sentiments of the “natives” and keep a vigilant eye on their activities. the collection, collation and publication of things and views “indian” — this colonial knowledge economy — was an integral part of the exercise of colonial power. parliamentary india is very different: the distance between the ruler and the ruled is sought to be bridged by universal franchise and electoral democracy. of course the need of the state to know its population inside out has generated novel and technicist modes of information recording — witness the aadhar scheme., still, the developmentalist aspect of the indian state has meant that its problem-solving enquiries largely yield policy recommendations; statistics, charts and histograms replace the evidences tendered and the voices heard or raised during the course of an enquiry. official reports now literally digest what comes up before them. the evidence volumes of yore no longer get printed or digitised and put on the web: the official report takes over the entire space.",0.10951080064716427,"hardly unanimous , mr. thorat","gandhi cartoons , navjivan trust , debate cartoons used ncert textbooks aids learning thrown range issues. discussion crystallised around set oppositions : motivated political correctness elected representatives vs. necessity preemptory parliamentary intervention educational material appropriate schools ;

2012-11-29,cashing in on schemes for poor,"in getting its ministers to endorse the shift to cash transfers from the aicc office in new delhi, the congress has highlighted the political nature of the move. the party clearly expects cash transfers to play the same role for it in 2014 that the national rural employment guarantee act did in 2009. by pouring money directly into the bank accounts of voters across the country, it expects to be paid back with additional seats in the lok sabha. but the politics of cash transfers is not the same as that of the mgnrega. and even if there is political gain for the congress from this move, it will come at a great social cost., the fundamental difference between the political economy of the nrega in 2009 and the cash transfers today is in the impact on inflation. the nrega was launched at a time when the macroeconomic goal was to provide an impetus to the indian economy at a time of a global slowdown. the impetus took the form of raising the fiscal deficit substantially, thereby providing the resources for the nrega. since the economy needed the additional expenditure there was only a limited immediate impact on inflation., this is not the macroeconomic situation today. with inflationary pressures remaining a concern there is need to be wary of any massive transfer of cash to voters. the politicians in the congress possibly believe they have got this covered since they are simply changing the way of delivering existing subsidies. as there is no additional expenditure involved, they seem convinced there will be no inflationary pressure from the move., the economist in the prime minister must however know otherwise. he will be sensitive to what economists call the multiplier effect. simply put, when cash is paid out to an individual she saves some of it and spends the rest. what she spends becomes income to someone else. the next person again saves some of this income and spends the rest, thereby creating income for a third person, and so on. the overall effect of putting cash into the economy is then several times greater than the original infusion, the exact multiple depending on the proportion of income that is spent., in the case of a transfer of welfare in kind, there is little scope for this multiplier to take effect. when a beneficiary receives food from a ration shop her family consumes the food without creating additional income for anyone else. the multiplier comes into play when the supply of subsidised food from the ration shop is replaced by cash. and if the government were to try to control the inflationary pressures by curbing money supply it runs the risk of going to the next elections with the economy slowing down. it is therefore no surprise that the food subsidy and the fertilizer subsidy have been kept out of the initial shift to cash transfers., the 29 schemes that are to form the initial round of cash transfer from january 1, 2013 focus primarily on reworking cash based welfare schemes such as pensions and student loans. the apparent political potential of this move, in the current system of patronage politics, explains the glee in the aicc office when the shift to cash transfers was endorsed. the entire transfer of the cash value of welfare schemes will now be seen as coming from the congress. the old process, in which a local politician was the link between a scheme and its beneficiaries, thus earning loyalty and building constituency, will no longer be valid. this would not only hurt opposition parties but would also weaken the grass root congress worker, while strengthening the party high command., the social costs of this move are however quite evident when we consider the precise mechanism through which the shift to cash transfers is to take place. the beneficiaries are to be identified using the unique identification of aadhar. there may be those who challenge the claims to perfection of the aadhar process, but that view is unlikely to overcome the widespread indian belief that what is technologically done must be perfect. even if we grant aadhar perfection, though, we must keep in mind that it is only a system of unique identification, nothing more. all that it does is to ensure that once a person says she is x, she cannot later say she is y., such a unique identification does not even guarantee that the person is in fact an indian. it is quite possible for a person from, say bangladesh, to cross our porous borders, go up to an aadhar office and get a card. aadhar does not believe it is its business to guarantee the nationality of the individual. with a convenient indian address she could then be eligible for direct cash transfers. this can make a significant difference to the working of cash transfers in some regions where borders are porous., moving away from the northeast there is an even greater challenge in an overreliance on aadhar. the proof that the person has once identified herself as x tells us nothing about whether x is, in fact, poor or eligible for the subsidy. the problem with ration cards today is twofold: there are multiple cards issued to the same households, and the below poverty line cards have been issued to those who are not poor. aadhar could help solve the first problem, but not the second. even with aadhar based identification, the non-poor can be classified as poor., what should cause greater concern is that there is little attention being paid to the transaction costs of the poor and illiterate accessing the bank accounts. in a study of the working of the mahatma gandhi national rural employment guarantee scheme in karnataka, it was found that the poor did not always get their full wages. in the more backward districts of the state, there was a significant difference between the wages paid out according to the mgnrega records and the wages the workers said they received. and it is not difficult to imagine how this could happen. the poor, especially if they are illiterate, are dependent on bank officials to tell them whether the money has been credited into their accounts. and if they seek the help of others in the village that too can come at an economic, if not social, cost., even in cases where the money reaches the right bank account and the right person, there could still be leakages in terms of how that money is spent. in some schemes this would not matter. a pension has served its stated purpose the moment it reaches the beneficiary. but there are other schemes such as student loans where a mechanism is still needed to ensure that the money that is transferred to the bank account is actually spent on education. when the cash transfer is from a distant source and the expenditure to be made is local, monitoring how the money is spent is no easy task. and if the money is not used for the stated purpose, it is a leakage of another kind.",0.07269532055246339,cashing schemes poor,"getting ministers endorse shift cash transfers aicc office new

2013-04-11,lessons from the east godavari pilot,"the government has initiated an interesting pilot for the public distribution system (pds) in east godavari, andhra pradesh. when cardholders go to buy their pds rations, their ration card number and uid (unique identification) number are punched into an “e-point of sale” (epos) machine. if the two match, they have to authenticate their fingerprint. if a successful authentication does not occur in five attempts, a mobile number can be entered, and a “one time password” (otp) is sent to that number. after successful fingerprint authentication or use of the otp, the sale can proceed., many firsts, there are many firsts (for andhra pradesh) in this pilot. one, a computerised database of ration cardholders makes it possible to track purchases. chhattisgarh and tamil nadu have been the pioneers in this and other states are working on it. two, the e-pos machine, a hand-held mini-computer, has made end-to-end computerisation a reality. further, it has neat features such as a voice-over facility (it calls out the commodity, quantity, prices and sale amount) and receipt printing device. these are important safeguards against cheating, especially the voice-over for those who cannot read or calculate easily. three, biometric authentication has introduced a mechanism for “last mile tracking” previously absent in andhra pradesh. four, authentication is done in real time, using the uid platform (a first in the country)., last mile tracking is any mechanism that allows the government to get information on whether grain has reached the beneficiary (and not just the ration shop). until recently, tracking mechanisms were weak or non-existent, making diversion of pds grain relatively easy. entries in ration cards (supposedly checked by government functionaries) were the commonly used method. in rajasthan and bihar, food coupons serve the same purpose — the release of grain to a dealer is linked to the number of coupons he deposits after collecting them from cardholders when they buy their rations. recent reports suggest that food coupons work relatively well in rajasthan, but not in bihar. elsewhere, “smart cards” to be swiped on epos machines are being piloted. the east godavari pilot uses online biometric authentication., the east godavari pilot has taken off largely due to the patient efforts of a dedicated joint collector. he was assisted by a full staff of functionaries — each mandal (equivalent to, but smaller than, a block) has a supply officer and a tehsildar (civil supplies). preparations took nearly two years — between december 2010 and december 2012, uid numbers were issued to 82 per cent of the population. this increased to 98 per cent by january 2013 after a special request was made to uidai. the joint collector described the operation being carried out in “mission mode” with a “war room” whereby a “control room had been set up to track enrolments and the seeding process.” the pilot began with 47 ration shops in september 2012, and was scaled up to 100 ration shops in january 2013. thus after two years of dedicated effort, the pilot was running in less than five per cent of the ration shops of the district., many hiccups were anticipated, and solutions were put in place, such as the otp facility to deal with failures of biometric authentication, particularly common with the elderly. the solutions, however, are not fool-proof. in pedabrahmadevam (samalkota mandal), biometric authentication failed for two elderly widows, thotakura ratnam and thotakura suryakantam, who were nearly in tears when i visited them. koppusetti mangayamma, an elderly antyodaya card holder, had to make four trips to get her ration. between september and january, 16-18 per cent of all transactions were through otp or manual override. other problems that needed to be resolved included data entry errors of uid and/or ration card numbers, incorrect matching of uid with ration card numbers, inability of some people to come to the ration shop, etc., a range of unexpected situations also arose. i met people who had not enrolled for, or not got, uid numbers or whose uid number had not been seeded. chikkala rajeswararao’s family is correctly reflected as a four-member household in the paper records, but the epos shows only one family member. as the andhra pradesh pds issues grain on a per capita basis, he was getting only 4 kg instead of 16 kg. in kothapalli, a pds outlet was closed because the machine had been taken to kakinada for repairs. there was no fallback option., heart-rending, the most heart-rending case was that of jyothi alamadamu (gollaprolu mandal). a tribal resident of the sweeper colony, she works as a maid. she broke into tears as she described her difficult situation: her three-year old twins were starving because in january, the e-pos did not recognise her ration card number. she had not been able to buy her ration., the purpose of listing these issues is not to find fault with the pilot, but to convey the inevitable difficulties that are bound to arise with any transition to a new system even when it is implemented with the utmost care and detailed planning. some elements of the pilot (like integrating the uid and pds databases) are extremely demanding in terms of personnel, planning, time and technology. in this case, one could count on a responsive administration to try to remedy the issues but such responsiveness is not the rule., for the government, there are two possible gains from the new system: saving grain that was earlier diverted and de-duplication. outright cheating in andhra pradesh is unusual. unclaimed ration (due to temporary migration) cannot be carried over. so dealers diverted it. with last mile biometric tracking, such diversion is not possible. if the carryover of one month’s quota to the next is allowed, it can end the diversion of unclaimed grain. other technologically less demanding last mile tracking methods such as food coupons and smart cards are also available.",0.08933982683982683,lessons east godavari pilot,"government initiated interesting pilot public distribution system

2013-05-21,"your data, going on sale soon","illustration: satwik gade , technology has created the potential to record, collate, converge, retrieve, mine, share, profile and otherwise conjure with data. data is the new property. the unique identification authority of india (uidai), with its push to enrol the whole indian resident population, signals the emergence of an information infrastructure facilitated by the government — it finances the “start up,” and uses its authority to coerce people to get on to the database, and then handed over to corporate interests when it reaches a “steady state.”, allowing private entry, the uidai was set up by an executive notification dated january 28, 2009. the planning commission was the nodal agency “for providing logistics, planning and budgetary support” and to “provide initial office and it infrastructure.” as part of its “role and responsibilities,” the uidai was to “issue necessary instructions to agencies that undertake creation of databases, to ensure standardisation of data elements that are collected and digitised and enable collation and correlation with uid unique identification number/aadhaar and its partner databases.” it was to “take necessary steps to ensure collation of npr national population register with uid”. and, the uidai “shall own and operate” the uid database., when the state holds data it collects in its transactions with its residents, it holds the data in a fiduciary capacity. it does not own the data., the framework for ownership of data was set out by the nandan nilekani-chaired technology advisory group for unique projects (tag-up), which gave its report in january 2011. while the nilekani committee directly addressed five projects — goods and services tax network, tax information network, expenditure information network, national treasury management agency and the new pension system — it recommended that the suggested framework “be more generally applicable to the complex it-intensive systems which are increasingly coming to prominence in the craft of indian public administration.”, as understood by tag-up, the government has two major tasks: policymaking and implementation. implementation is weak, and rather than spend time finding correctives, the committee found in this an opportunity for private business interests. so, tag-up suggested the setting up of national information utilities (nius)., “nius would be private companies with a public purpose: profit-making, not profit maximising.” the government would have “strategic control,” that is, it would be focused on how it would achieve the objectives and outcomes, leaving the niu “flexible” in its functioning. total private ownership should be at least 51 per cent. the government should have at least 26 per cent shares. once it reaches steady state, the government would be a “paying customer.” as a paying customer, “the government would be free to take its business to another niu”; though, given the “large upfront sunk-cost, economies of scale, and network externalities from a surrounding ecosystem (and what this means is not explained any further), nius are ... essentially set up as natural monopolies.” to get a buy-in from the bureaucracy, “in-service officers” are to be deployed in the nius and are to be given an allowance of 30 per cent of their remuneration., government as customer, “once the rollout is completed,” the nilekani committee blithely states, “the government’s role shifts to that of a customer.”, in sum, what emerges from the tag-up report is this: governmental data and databases are to be privatised through the creation of nius which will then “own” the data. nius will be natural monopolies. nius will use the data and the database for profit-making and not profit-maximising, and the definition of these terms are indeterminate., government will support the nius through funding them till they reach a steady state, and by doing what is needed to gather the data and create the database using governmental authority. once the niu reaches steady state, the government will reappear as the customer of the niu. government officers will be deployed in nius and be paid 30 per cent over their salaries, which, even if the report does not say it explicitly, is expected to forge loyalties and vested interests. the notion of holding citizens’ data in a fiduciary capacity cedes place to the vesting of ownership over citizens’ data in an entity which will then have the government as their customer., this notion of private companies owning our data has not been discussed with state governments, nor with people from whom information is being collected., unexplained, we might have treated the tag-up report as another report without a future; except, in the budget presented by mr. pranab mukherjee as finance minister in march 2012, he announced that the “gstn (goods and sales tax network) will be set up as a national information utility.” the niu was not explained to parliament, and no one seems to have raised any questions about what it is., there is disturbing evidence that the uidai provided the basis for the niu. the report is littered with references to the uidai, and suggests that the way the uidai has been functioning is a model for the niu. the biometrics standards committee set up by the uidai in september 2009 and which gave its report in december 2009 declared that the uidai intended to “create a platform to first collect identity details of residents, and subsequently perform identity authentication services that can be used by government and commercial service providers.” the “uidai strategy overview,” in april 2010, estimated that it would generate rs.288.15 crore in annual revenue through address and biometric authentication once it reaches a steady state, where authentication services for new mobile connections, pan cards, gas connections, passports, lic policies, credit cards, bank accounts and airline check-in, would net this profit. till then, it is to be funded by the government. once that stage is reached, it will be a private, profit-making entity and the government, like other commercial service providers, will become its customer., data for a price, mr. nilekani calls it “open architecture”; that is, applications can be thought up as the business grows; there are no limits or contours within which it should be used. he has repeatedly described the uid as a unique number, which will be universal and ubiquitous; the latter two indicate that, despite being marketed as voluntary, all activities and services are intended to be made dependent on the uid for all persons, ensuring steady business for the enterprise. the uid enrolment form has a column for “information sharing consent.” this will allow the uidai to part with the data, both demographic and biometric, for a price. this explains why there has been so little enthusiasm for a law on the subject. a bill was introduced in parliament close to two years after the project was started. when the parliamentary standing committee rejected the bill and the project in december 2011, the law was consigned to oblivion.",0.05636183261183261,"data , going sale soon","illustration : satwik gade , technology created potential record , collate , converge , retrieve , mine , share , profile otherwise conjure data. data new property. unique identification authority india ( uidai ) , push enrol whole indian resident population , signals emergence information infrastructure facilitated government — finances “start , ” uses authority coerce people get database , handed corporate interests reaches “steady state. ” , allowing private entry , uidai set executive notification dated january 28 , 2009. planning commission nodal agency “for providing logistics , planning budgetary support ” “provide initial office infrastructure. ” part “role responsibilities , ” uidai “issue necessary instructions agencies undertake creation databases , ensure standardisation data elements collected digitised enable collation correlation uid unique identification number/aadhaar partner databases. ” “take necessary steps ensure collation npr national population register uid ” . , uidai “shall operate ” uid database. , state holds data collects transactions residents , holds data fiduciary capacity. data. , framework ownership data set nandan nilekani-chaired technology advisory group unique projects ( tag-up ) , gave report january 2011. nilekani committee directly addressed five projects — goods services tax network , tax information network , expenditure information network , national treasury management agency new pension system — recommended suggested framework “be generally applicable complex it-intensive systems increasingly coming prominence craft indian public administration. ” , understood tag-up , government two major tasks : policymaking implementation. implementation weak , rather spend time finding correctives , committee found opportunity private business interests. , tag-up suggested setting national information utilities ( nius ) . , “nius would private companies public purpose : profit-making , profit maximising. ” government would “strategic control , ” , would focused would achieve objectives outcomes , leaving niu “flexible ” functioning. total private ownership least 51 per cent. government least 26 per cent shares. reaches steady state , government would “paying customer. ” paying customer , “the government would free take business another niu ” ;

2013-06-09,we aren’t deliberately elitist,"jonathan larsen, global head of retail banking and head of consumer banking, asia pacific , citibank is known for its sharp focus on retail banking, especially credit cards. the sub-prime crisis of 2008 forced the bank on the back foot but in the last two years, it has returned with some aggressive moves on the retail banking front including the launch of its premier miles card, the country’s first airlines-agnostic mileage-points-linked credit card., with just 42 branches across the country, citi carries the image of an exclusive bank that caters only to the affluent. in this interview with the hindu in bangalore, where he was on a visit last week, jonathan larsen, global head of retail banking and head of consumer banking, asia pacific, says that the bank’s limited network is not by choice and is due to central bank regulations. “as a consumer bank, we are more interested in cities than in countries,” says 46-yea- old mr. larsen, who’s based in hong kong, adding that given the chance, citi would build a similar network as a local bank. excerpts:, from your perch in citibank and in hong kong, how do you see the global economy moving right now?, i think we are finally seeing some level of growth resuming. to say that this is a strong recovery is premature. it’s going to be a long slow journey in europe, a very long period of low growth. i think policymakers have actually done a pretty good job, mario draghi in particular, in actually keeping the euro together and dispelling the fear in global markets relating to europe that we saw in the last couple of years. china and india are growing a little more slowly than we expected. external demand is still a factor for china, and it is taking time for them to rebuild their economy. india is very different. the real story for india over the long-term is the consumer story. interestingly, despite a slower macro environment, we are actually seeing strong growth and demand for services among our customers. so, it is a mixed picture with a relatively slower outlook for the next couple of years., as a consumer banker, what will be the challenge of operating in an environment like this for you?, i do not think we are going to shape our strategy based on short-term economic cycles. what we have learned is that we have to be very clear about what businesses we are in, what we are good at doing, where we can compete, where we can differentiate our offering, and this is especially relevant when we are a relatively small footprint bank in a very large market with very large entrenched competitors, like in india., what has been your experience promoting digital banking in emerging markets like india?, let me answer that in a couple of ways. one is that it is very clear that digitisation is, along with globalisation and urbanisation, one of the three major trends reshaping the world, and, in particular, the consumer landscape in all the industries, not just ours. banking has partially been transformed but certainly not totally at this point. the technology exists today to digitise pretty much everything that banks do. but there are a lot of other factors at play and very important customer behavioural characteristics., it is interesting that the prevailing view in the late 90s was that branches would disappear altogether and that banking would be virtualised but nothing of that sort has happened. what has really happened is that digital is really just one more channels that has overlaid on everything that existed in the past and bank branches remain very much a reality. customer behaviour takes time to adapt. partly, it is the role of cash in the society; many emerging markets tend to be heavily cash-based. it’s going to take a long time to completely displace that. so the way we think about it is that we are not in a either or world, we are in a world where we have got to actually think of where our consumers are, what their needs are, what their preferences are, and have a range of channels to meet them., in india, citibank has the image of being an elite bank. are you comfortable with that or would you like to change it?, we are who we are. if you look at our past, we have made mistakes. one of the mistakes was getting into the consumer finance business and opening 650 branches around the country and going after a target market that certainly for us was not something that was viable, so we exited it., no one could accuse us of being elitist at that time. in our credit card business we are full spectrum. we are not interested in pushing the boundaries of creditworthiness. that is not a smart strategy in a place like india for someone like us. take the suvidha business which we started right here in bangalore. at the time, it was an experiment to see whether it would be possible to build a more broadly based business that did not just speak to affluent clients. and it happened to coincide with the rapid expansion of the software and bpo industry here and we were able to sort of ride that wave and be a bank of choice. it is a really good example of us, finding our way to be relevant to the market. so, i do not think we are deliberately elitist, we’ve only got 42 branches. we are not icici or hdfc, we never will be, we cannot possibly address the market on the scale that those banks do., what has prevented you from going beyond 42 branches? is it just the central bank’s regulations or is it that you are also comfortable with this kind of a number?, no, we would love to have more branches. as a consumer bank, we are more interested in cities than we are in countries. our strategy is to focus on the top 150 cities in the world. we are in 132 of them today. we are the only bank that is anywhere close to that. there really are no global consumer banks left in the world apart from citi. the post-crisis era has seen a shake-out of pretty significant proportions and you have seen many banks that have had a broad footprint, exit from entire regions. so, for us these top cities are critical; nine of those are in india. under current regulations, there are simply no licences available in those places. it just does not make economic sense for us to go, open citibank branches in rural areas or in third-tier cities., that is not your style of banking?, it is not about style of banking but there’s just no way we can make money. and if we cannot make money, we just cannot do it., but don’t you think that has to be counter-balanced with financial inclusion?, of course, i think one of our missions as a company is to support financial inclusion in any way we can. financial inclusion is not going to be our core business strategy. we don’t know how to make money out of doing that right now. if we did, it could be a different discussion, so we don’t know how to do that., i don’t think any bank has cracked that in india…, yes. and it is a fact that we contribute in many other ways to financial inclusion. we’ve had many discussions with the government about the possibility of implementing cost-effective payments, for example, for the distribution of welfare and using things like mobile technology to support that. we definitely have technology and solutions that could be hugely helpful in these areas, and we think leveraging those kinds of capabilities is probably a much more constructive way for us to be contributing to social inclusion and financial inclusion than to force us to open five branches in places that no one has ever heard of before. we are very conscious of the need to give back in markets around the world where we built successful businesses. incidentally, we are the only foreign bank empanelled for aadhar., how does india’s regulatory environment compare with other countries you do business in?, it’s a complex regulatory environment here and is a highly restrictive one for foreign banks. we have large local banks that are listed here but they are 80 per cent owned by foreigners. what’s the difference between a foreign-owned listed local bank and a bank that has been here for 110 years, hugely committed to the country and doing everything in its power to behave with absolute responsibility and integrity? why would the regulatory framework not encourage us? that’s a fair question to ask and we understand the social inclusion objectives of the governments and not just the government in india, as we do in many countries. we do recognise the need to contribute beyond our direct business activities.",0.1471586250394197,’ deliberately elitist,"jonathan larsen , global head retail banking head consumer banking , asia pacific , citibank known sharp focus retail banking , especially

2013-06-23,‘gold should be utilised for productive use’,"having registered uninterrupted growth, aluva-based federal bank has set higher targets as part of a strategy to make its presence known within and outside kerala. shyam srinivasan, managing director and ceo, outlines the bank’s strategies and trends in the banking sector in a free-wheeling interview to the hindu., excerpts:, how does federal bank want to position itself over the next few years? do you have growth ambitions outside kerala?, among kerala-headquartered banks, we are the largest, in terms of network, across the country. state bank of travancore (sbt) has about 1,000 branches, and the majority of them are in kerala. our branches are spread more or less equally in kerala and outside., the primary objective of federal bank is that we want to be the best entity from kerala for the outside world. i want federal bank to be the biggest name after ayurveda on everybody’s lips in india. that is the dream we have., in select geographies, we are able to get good quality growth. we want to be in the consideration zone of everybody, wherever you are, for your financial requirement. that is the aspiration of the bank., the segments where we have done well are the sme and nri spaces. it has taken us 67 years to build (a strong base) in the home market., do you believe the banking sector has adequately taken care of the credit requirements of the farming segment?, there are two factors. there is credit requirement for building an agricultural-based business, and there is a larger requirement to make it an industry or a larger business., both these are business opportunities. but wherever individuals are doing farming as an occupation, establishing credit facility is a perennial challenge., there is availability of credit for anything that has a business dimension., the question is how to lend, collect and serve those who do not have established credit records., that is where the financial inclusion journey becomes very important. unfortunately, it is going to take time., have the recent restrictions on labour, such as nitaqat in saudi arabia, affected the inflow of nri remittances from middle east countries?, the flow of nri remittances is largely dependent on the rupee value. nitaqat pertains to unskilled labour without recognised work permits., they are not large remitters because their disposable income is less, but some sort of correction is also taking place. they come back or go to other locations. i think the issue is not financial; it is about rehabilitating them. in the last few weeks, the remittances have gone up substantially only because the rupee is weak., i used to live in middle east in the 90s. even then, there were talks of repatriating people who do not have formal work permits or those who haven’t been meeting certain criteria. that i think is a perennial chain of activity; every now and then it gets amplified., what progress has federal bank made in the field of net banking?, the market in india is not homogeneous. there are people who are extremely technology savvy. the young are progressive; but in some parts of india, people do not want to miss the opportunity to go to the branch. they feel comfortable when they meet the manager and have a conversation., in terms of people signed up with an id to use net banking, it is going up by almost half to one per cent every month., in a year, we are adding 5 to 10 per cent. the question is whether they use only net banking for all their transactions. the answer is ‘no’. maybe, between two and five per cent of our customers use only net banking. another 5 per cent use net banking and branch banking. the remaining avail themselves of branch banking. i believe they (net banking and branch banking) will co-exist., certain banks have been penalised for failing to wholly comply with ky c norms. what lessons are there to be learned from this?, there are mandated standards to check money laundering. what has come to light is that in some branches, the norms have not been diligently adhered to. it is not a systemic problem., individuals in certain branches are either not 100 per cent compliant; or have assumed that they are compliant., overall, we have to do an identification of the customer. you need to make sure that there are certain principles. it happens 98 per cent of the time, but there are instances when someone has either overstepped or has been coerced by others., if it money laundering is happening, it is not because people have welcomed it., that is why the regulator gives punishment. it is not that the banks are encouraging it. there may be individuals who are either innocent or naïve or whatever, who can be pushed into it. if we notice it, we take action. but the regulator is closely watching., banks have been urged to slow down on lending to purchase gold coins. what is your assessment of this decision?, the finance minister has asked banks not to encourage people to buy gold by lending money. we do lend against gold. it is collateral. it is a very good way of getting money; instead of lying in the cupboard at home, gold could be utilised for productive use. kerala is the pioneer in it. nbfcs and banks are doing it and it will continue., is that not an indirect way of encouraging purchase of gold?, india has been getting 1,000 tonnes of gold every year. official estimates say that 20,000 to 25,000 tonnes of gold is lying with people. only 1,000 tonnes have come out. the rest is lying in cupboards. once that comes into productive use, the economy will be benefited., the bigger need of the country is investment. small or big, investment has to happen., how do you look at the electronic benefit transfer scheme currently being implemented by the government? will it not create stress on banking?, about three lakh customers have signed up for the aadhaar card. in the last two weeks, we have seen some lpg subsidy coming in. about rs. 5-6 lakh is coming to the bank every day in the initial stage. it is routed through aadhar payment. it will happen; the volume we don’t know., we have created a payment bridge for those who have signed up under the aadhaar-enabled scheme. we are encouraging more and more customers to move to link to their aadhaar card account., i think the scheme is a very good because electronic transfer is happening. yes, it may mean that more customers will come to the branches and they may be small ticket customers. i think in our kind of bank, we want those customers to come. then only the banking habit gets inculcated., gold and real estate have been prime attractions for many depositors. don’t you think investment in bank deposits should be more attractive to be able to compete?, the launch of inflation-indexed bonds, to some extent, is partly an answer to this. gold has remained very attractive. but it is not true that bank deposits are not attractive. we, as a country and as indians, have great faith in gold. that is one reason (for the phenomenon)., quite often, entrepreneurs are not receiving the required support from banks. what is your opinion?",0.12828705070182342,‘gold utilised productive use ’,"registered uninterrupted growth , aluva-based federal bank set higher targets part strategy make presence known within outside kerala. shyam srinivasan , managing director ceo , outlines bank ’ strategies trends banking sector free-wheeling interview hindu. , excerpts : , federal bank want position next years ? growth ambitions outside kerala? , among kerala-headquartered banks , largest , terms network , across country. state bank travancore ( sbt ) 1,000 branches , majority kerala. branches spread less equally kerala outside. , primary objective federal bank want best entity kerala outside world. want federal bank biggest name ayurveda everybody ’ lips india. dream have. , select geographies , able get good quality growth. want consideration zone everybody , wherever , financial requirement. aspiration bank. , segments done well sme nri spaces. taken us 67 years build ( strong base ) home market. , believe banking sector adequately taken care credit requirements farming segment? , two factors. credit requirement building agricultural-based business , larger requirement make industry larger business. , business opportunities. wherever individuals farming occupation , establishing credit facility perennial challenge. , availability credit anything business dimension. , question lend , collect serve established credit records. , financial inclusion journey becomes important. unfortunately , going take time. , recent restrictions labour , nitaqat saudi arabia , affected inflow nri remittances middle east countries? , flow nri remittances largely dependent rupee value. nitaqat pertains unskilled labour without recognised work permits. , large remitters disposable income less , sort correction also taking place. come back go locations. think issue financial ;

2013-08-07,parliamentary supremacy under attack,"parliament is the custodian of the constitution of india. the preamble to the constitution proclaims the supremacy of the people of the country. they exercise their supremacy through their elected representatives who are the members of parliament. nowadays, the non-functioning of parliament is making headlines . and rightly so. the 15th lok sabha could be termed the least productive in the annals of indian parliament. as per the statistics prepared by the lok sabha secretariat, only 1,157 hours of sittings took place until the 12th session of the 15th lok sabha. this is far behind the record of the 14th lok sabha, which had 1,736 hours and 55 minutes of sittings. in fact, the first lok sabha held 677 sittings of about 3,784 hours during its 14 sessions. the story is no different in the rajya sabha, the upper house of parliament. for the first time in its history, the >upper house returned the budget without any discussion., uid bill in abeyance, however this is not the only thing corroding the functioning of democracy. the executive has taken most policy decisions without the concurrence of the supreme legislative body of our country. a classic example of this is the aadhar, a much hyped programme of the upa government. the aadhar card is regarded as a pre-requisite for getting all government benefits. without the aadhar number, a student would not get any benefit from the central and state governments. direct benefit transfer is based on aadhar numbers. bank accounts are to be linked to it. but what is the legislative backing for aadhar? the >uid bill is supposed to be the law for the implementation of aadhar. but the parliamentary standing committee had submitted its reports with serious objections to most provisions of the bill. the government has kept it in cold storage and is not ready to move the bill in parliament in any form for consideration and passing., but aadhar has already become a reality and an unavoidable part of the life of an indian citizen. this covert approach of the government was also visible when it introduced the contributory pension scheme for central and state government employees. all the state governments in our country are collecting the contribution from crores of their employees for the pension fund. but we find that the bill relating to it is still pending in parliament. what is the legality of collecting hundreds of crores of rupees during all these years? these are only a few instances of the government bypassing parliament for implementing major policy decisions., the constitution clearly defines and demarcates the powers of different organs of the democratic system. when parliament passes a law, it becomes the law of the land. all citizens of the country are bound to adhere to it. but this constitutional mandate is observed more in its violation., unanimous decision overruled, while presenting the union budget 2012-13, the then finance minister pranab mukherjee had introduced retrospective taxation. both houses passed the finance bill unanimously with these provisions. but when p. chidambaram became the finance minister, the scene dramatically changed. he constituted a one-man committee to review this new tax reform. within a week of submission of the report by parthasarathi shome, the tax expert, the government decided to defer the retrospective taxation for three years. can the unanimous decision of the supreme legislative body of this country be overruled by an expert?, usurpation, parliamentary committees are considered a miniature of parliament. usually, the committees consist of members of parliament representing most political parties. in developed democracies, only parliament can overrule the decision of the parliamentary committees. but in india, the executive has the right to adopt or reject the recommendations of a parliamentary committee. if the government incorporates a new clause in a bill, which was not there in the original bill, it should again send it to the committee for its consideration. but contrary to this constitutional convention practised hitherto, for the first time in the history of the indian republic, the government constituted an expert committee to evaluate the recommendations of a parliamentary standing committee. to our surprise, when the parliamentary standing committee on finance submitted its report on direct tax code, we found the finance ministry immediately constituting a committee on this report. though the ministry gave some explanations when the controversy erupted, can it be considered fair or just? was it not usurpation of parliamentary authority and a way of curbing the voice of the people?, all these are nothing but clear indications of a plan to undermine the legislative powers of parliament. this is further highlighted in other policy issues too. before the 1990s, the common man in india would eagerly wait before his tv set or radio for the announcement of budget proposals in order to learn about the changes in tax rates, changes in prices of different commodities, rail fares, etc. but nowadays, no one is serious about the budget. of late, we find that not only parliament but also the executive has no power in the pricing of petroleum products. the government has handed over the power to oil companies. according to the last railway budget, the train fares would be decided by a regulatory authority.",0.05226927327991159,parliamentary supremacy attack,"parliament custodian constitution india. preamble constitution proclaims supremacy people country. exercise supremacy elected representatives members parliament. nowadays , non-functioning parliament making headlines . rightly so. 15th lok sabha could termed least productive annals indian parliament. per statistics prepared lok sabha secretariat , 1,157 hours sittings took place 12th session 15th lok sabha. far behind record 14th lok sabha , 1,736 hours 55 minutes sittings. fact , first lok sabha held 677 sittings 3,784 hours 14 sessions. story different rajya sabha , upper house parliament. first time history , >upper house returned budget without discussion. , uid bill abeyance , however thing corroding functioning democracy. executive taken policy decisions without concurrence supreme legislative body country. classic example aadhar , much hyped programme upa government. aadhar card regarded pre-requisite getting government benefits. without aadhar number , student would get benefit central state governments. direct benefit transfer based aadhar numbers. bank accounts linked it. legislative backing aadhar ?

2013-08-29,food security,"it was tamil bard and freedom fighter subramania bharati who once said: “if even a single individual starves without food, we will destroy the entire world.” thus, the food bill is a laudable achievement in tune with his vision., there could be loopholes here and there. amendments, if any, as suggested by right thinking people or the opposition should be incorporated wherever necessary to make the system wholesome., r. sampath,, chennai, it is a life security bill for the aam aadmi, bringing a ray of hope to poor people. they can now lead a dignified life., kiran jose,, kottayam, this is a landmark legislation unparalleled even in the developed world. the upa chairperson deserves credit; more so her spirited speech in parliament on the vision behind it., maj. r. murugaiyan,, kochi, the fact is that agriculture will receive a much-needed boost. it will be interesting to see how modern industrial india with its hunger for land, balances fresh agrarian interest in the use of prime holdings. will we see conflict again?

in a ‘notice’ inviting a biometrics consultant, the uidai was saying, in january-february 2010: “there is a lack of a sound study that documents the accuracy achievable on indian demographics (that is, larger percentage of rural population) and in indian environmental conditions (that is, extremely hot and humid climates and facilities without air-conditioning). in fact, we do not have any credible study assessing the achievable accuracy in any of the developing countries.... the ‘quality’ assessment of fingerprint data (in the uidai’s ‘preliminary assessment’) is not sufficient to fully understand the achievable de-duplication accuracy.” yet, the decision had already been made, that the fingerprints and iris scan of the entire population be stored on the uidai database. later reports on enrolment, and fingerprint and iris authentication, revealed deep flaws in the system, and escalating costs; but no one seems to have been paying attention to the emerging evidence., no responsibility, the uid project has been weak on respect for the law. despite the potential for surveillance, tracking, tagging, profiling and even exclusion that the project holds – say, migrant workers develop calluses in their hands that makes matching their fingerprint to that on the uid database a hard task – there has been no law protecting the rights of people, or detailing the liability of agencies that handle personal data. through the years since the project was launched, there has only been the executive notification by which the uidai was set up in january 2009; which, among other things, says that the uidai would ‘own’ the data. it was december 2010 when, bowing to pressure from civil society activists, a law was tabled in the rajya sabha, which was then referred to the standing committee. in december 2011, the standing committee delivered a scathing report which asked that the project, and the law, be taken back to the drawing board; there were too many problems with both., in response, the government did nothing; the report passed by them like an idle wind, which shakespeare had taught them to respect not. from then, until now, the law is non-existent. this has allowed the uidai to expand the fields of data it collects, aggressively push for making enrolment mandatory to access any service or legal right, enter into data sharing agreements, and shrug off the idea of responsibility when there is identity fraud, or where authentication failures occur. the fait accompli is being created in a rush.",0.06035509031198685,failed number,"unique , universal , ubiquitous : three words mr nandan nilekani used describe ambitions uid project. every person across population 1.2 billion uniquely identified. every person enrolled. number ‘seeded ’ every data base , system re-engineered , making uid number indispensable every individual every system. uid project based ambitions. , biometrics uidai ’ route uniqueness. except little , nothing , known biometrics project started. much uidai know efficacy biometrics made decision capture fingerprints iris scans , use biometrics ‘de-duplicate ’ whole population ?

(anyone who has resided in an area for six months or who intends to reside in the area for six months or more is a “usual resident,” as per the official definition)., besides, the present controversy is not over the legality of the npr exercise, which, a senior official points out, is on solid footing and carried out as per law. the official also adds that through the npr process, one can get an aadhaar number., though the process covers the entire country, it is more intensive in 14 states and two union territories, which are called ‘npr states,’ which means that people in these states and union territories can get aadhaar numbers only through the npr. for 14 other states, four union territories and the national capital territory of delhi, one gets an aadhaar number through the unique identification authority of india (uidai). though andhra pradesh strictly comes under the second category of states, some districts have been assigned to the census authorities for enabling people to get aadhaar numbers., the census official says there is a strict procedure in place to ensure that “unwanted” persons are not included. when house-listing and housing census, forming part of the first phase of census 2011, were carried out in april-september 2010, enumerators, who were government servants, collected data from families concerned and took their signatures. the idea is to enable the authorities to prosecute those who furnished false information., as the second step in the npr operations, what is taking place now in several parts of the country is capture of biometric details of every resident such as iris scans and 10 fingerprints, besides photograph. these details have to be collected in the presence of government staff. once the enrolment drive is over, lists of residents will be displayed in the respective areas for claims and objections. they will also be scrutinised by local officials, in addition to placing them in meetings of ‘gram sabhas’ and ward committees. all these stages are aimed at ensuring authenticity, the official explains., procedural flaw, in rural areas, enrolment is being done village by village and taluk by taluk, while in urban areas, wards are covered in phases. as per the original plan, the distribution of ‘know your resident +’ forms should precede capture of biometric details. there is nothing to show that this has indeed been carried out in many places as per procedure., but, the official says that keeping in mind the increasing public pressure on his department to complete the coverage quickly, special counters have been opened.",0.09482142857142857,"npr rolls , regardless","supreme court ’ latest order aadhaar card seems little bearing ongoing enrolment national population register ( npr ) . reason simple : link entitlements. , also , business as-usual continues mandatory every “usual resident , ” every citizen , complete registration , per citizenship act rules.

2014-01-29,two wheels and a tragedy,"cycles gathering dust at the rohini (east) metro station for the last two years. photo: sushil kumar verma | photo credit: sushil kumar verma , this is a common chord that binds many of us no matter where we live, where we have grown up., well, i am referring to your bicycle stories. as a child, as a student riding to school or through the colony park, as an adult pedalling to work or even as a sunday cyclist belonging to an enthusiast club, you certainly would have at least one yarn on the experience of riding by balancing on the two wheels. i clearly can recall a sense of coming-of-age, of self-dependence and adventure, holding tight the handlebars, riding to school many summers ago., obviously then, on seeing sporadic signboards on delhi roads that say ‘cycle lane’, or going past bicycle lending stations on the brt and at the delhi university metro station, the heart gets hopeful, if not nostalgic. you perceive that someone somewhere at the helm of decision-making for the national capital wants the public to use bicycles. in a city of flyovers frustratingly packed with cars, it certainly gives hope — for a choice to cover short distances on a cycle through the dedicated lanes, or to complete the last mile home on a borrowed bike after a metro ride. not to mention contributing your two bits to delhi’s environment!, the thrill is soon gone though. faulty road designs, shoddy project implementation, half-hearted efforts at promoting the initiatives tell their sad stories., delhi metro rail corporation’s attempt began in 2008, as a cycle feeder service. in 2014, there is just one station — vishwa vidyalaya — that offers the facility. in over five years, instead of expanding the service, dmrc has shrunk it. not due to low user demand but because of its failure to come up with a strategy to run the service smoothly., it launched a state-of-the-art cycle lending service through a private operator at its rohini (east) station on world environment day in 2010 with fan fare. only to suspend it nine months later. a row of green-coloured cycles gathers dust in a locked enclosure outside the station since last two years., sanjeev garg and atul jain of delhi cycles pvt. ltd, who ran the service for dmrc, sound bitter. the duo claims to have given dmrc the idea. “in 2001, we emailed dmrc about a project to open cycle lending outlets at its stations for commuters to complete the last mile home. in november 2008, they took our idea and gave the contract to planet advertising to run a cycle feeder service at 15 stations. we however, continued to pursue it with dmrc. from an ngo, we formed a company. in end 2009, we were allotted one station. we began to operate in 2010 by investing 32 lakhs. we have now lost that money,” states jain. garg shows a power point presentation of the project, mentioning, “unlike our competitors, we issued smart cards to users similar to what dmrc uses. the cycles could be monitored through a chip, also the hours that a user clocks. we took space from mcd to set up sheds across rohini where users could deposit their cycles.”, while planet advertising with 15 stations and advertising rights was not asked to pay any security money or share revenue with dmrc, delhi cycles, without any advertising rights, had to. garg says, “we paid rs.50,000 as security to dmrc plus 25 per cent of the fare as revenue share.”, in mid-2013, dmrc discontinued its agreement with planet advertising before the five-year term ended, reportedly leading to arbitration., sudhir haryal of planet advertising sounds disgruntled. “dmrc seems confused, our cycle stands were running fine. the overheads are high, cycles often get stolen. nobody came forward to run the service for them, we did, but the government is not helping us.”, though dmrc floated a fresh tender in december 2013 to choose operators, it has subsequently been “kept in abeyance.”, dmrc spokesperson anuj dayal, without giving any time frame for reopening the service, says, “an overall planning and study is to be carried out by urban mass transit company ltd. with other agencies such as mcd, ndmc, dda, cpwd, uttipec (unified traffic & transportation integrated planning & engineering centre) about the cycle shelter project and after completing this study, its implementation will be reviewed.”, meanwhile, haryal’s initiative green revolution runs nine cycle lending booths on the brt corridor. he claims they are running well but others accuse him of “using the space only for advertisements.”, since there is not much scope to earn from users, advertising rights make these spaces lucrative. virender chopra, who runs the du service with advertising rights, too is pinning hopes on getting rights to open more booths., the lending booths on the brt seem user-unfriendly. either your aadhar or election card or driving licence has to be deposited without a receipt to lend a cycle. after using it, you are to return it to the same station though the operator is the same., haryal says, “a user can register on our website as a member to avoid giving originals.” i couldn’t find a booth willing to do so., du station users also need to return the cycle at the same booth plus surrender an identity card. chopra says it is because cycles get stolen., “the system works here as our users are mostly students who come out of metro, borrow a cycle to go around the campus and return here, then collect their i-d cards.” the station has 20 cycles. the average number of users per day is 12, says dayal., the number is dismal considering delhi’s transport department had a bicycle master plan as early as 1998. iit-delhi professor and project coordinator for the plan, geetam tiwari, is “still hopeful” even as she points out certain creases that need ironing., “the traffic jams happen because we are wasting road space. in the plan, we insisted on dedicated cycle lanes on the arterial roads of delhi not because cyclists would be safe this way but also because cars can go better. this has been implemented by pwd on some roads during the commonwealth games though some just end abruptly,

offices, is missing, the cap can be used in its place. this is one of the real-life incidents that was turned into a rib-tickling episode in marimayam, a popular comedy on mazhavil manorama that highlights sleaze, incompetence and delay in government offices, public and private institutions., the ‘cap episode’ was written by shihab karunagappally, one of the many from different walks of life who have contributed to the show, which shows the common man and his woes as he runs from one office to the other in search of a solution to his problems., sathyasheelan, koya, lolithan, mandodari and syamala, all characters in the show, highlight how red tape often strangles the common man or ties him in knots., “whoever thought that a series that took viewers through the maze of government would click with viewers?” wonders r. unnikrishnan, the producer of the show., steering clear of the melodramatic saas-bahu sob sagas and domestic bickering, which goes in the name of comedy on malayalam television channels, marimayam bring bytes of reality garnished with humour and satire., “conflicts and flaws within the system and society create laughs. we have avoided double entendres, sleazy dialogues and scenes by keeping the show plain and simple. while topical jokes are used aplenty, what keeps viewers glued to the show are the current topics we tackle and the conflicts and confusion that arise as a result of that,” explains unnikrishnan., perhaps that is why viewers also chip in with ideas based on their experience with the powers that be., “most of them are amateur writers who send the script to the channel. if we like the idea, changes are suggested, if needed. some viewers send just the idea and we work on it. our experiences also inspire certain episodes,” he says., n.p. sajeesh, shihab and vaddakumthala sreekumar, who have been scriptwriters, say in unison that government offices are a treasure trove of such comic situations., “it is a fact that corruption has become ingrained in our system, which is the underlying theme of the show. after the initial few episodes, we moved out of government offices to themes such as moral policing and ‘nookkukooli’ because they are relevant topics,” says sajeesh, who works as a sub-editor in a malayalam magazine., blood banks, revision of pension age, plight of small scale entrepreneurs, confusion over the aadhar card ... are some of the subjects that have been taken up in the serial., “many incidents i have seen and heard have been converted into scripts. i do tweak certain instances for the episode,” says shihab who has written over 20 episodes for the programme., sreekumar, who works as a malayalam teacher at madathil bjsm higher secondary school, thazhava, kollam, has written about the sorry state of the kerala state road transport corporation, distribution of free uniforms to school students, educational loans and the apl-bpl confusion over distribution of wheat and rice, among others., “there is always an element of grief in most of the stories. it is just that we put it across with a touch of humour,” says sreekumar, who has also written some episodes for munshi on asianet, and a couple of comedies for doordarshan and other regional channels., what they all assert is that trying to get a malayali audience to laugh or even smile is perhaps the toughest job around., “the humour has to be simple, but bang on,” says sreekumar., another tough job is the necessity for accuracy regarding procedures and laws of the land. “the episodes are not preachy, but we incorporate a lot of information pertaining to various aspects that many of us deal with. therefore a lot of research goes into ensuring that the facts are authentic,” says the producer., they have got accolades and criticism. “some government officers have even asked us how we recreate the situations so well. however, there are certain officers who complain that we are showing them in a poor light,” unnikrishnan says., while getting into the thick of things, say at a panchayat office, taluk office, a government hospital, a school or bank, these writers even come up with new ideas, without going astray, he adds., all of them lavishly give credit to the amazing cast of the show., “they are such incredible actors that the script gets transformed into a different level altogether. they improvise with dialogue delivery, body language, and the best part is that they do spot dubbing, which lends a fresh feel to the show,” says shihab., sajeesh adds: “they just behave. marimayam is all about verbal humour, not the slapstick comedy that you find in most shows.”, the characters have become so popular that film producer milan jaleel made a movie, vallatha pahayan, featuring the artistes. the serial also received the kerala state award for the best comedy programme for two consecutive years. well, as is the trend these days, it is the reign of the aam aadmi on the small screen too., marimayam airs on sundays, 9 p.m., on the rolls, manikandan pattambi (sathyasheelan), niyas bekkar (koya), s.p. sreekumar (lolithan), sneha (mandodari), manju pathrose (syamala), riyas (manmathan), mani shornur (sugathan),

2014-02-03,compulsion by stealth,"“this debate is … about our specific disagreement on the meaning of that one word,” i.e. “the government now seek to persuade us that ‘voluntary’ actually means ‘compulsory’.”, that was nick clegg in the united kingdom’s house of commons in march 2006. mr. clegg and others were opposing the labour government’s decision to renew passports only if the applicants possess a national id card. the debate, apart from being hilarious, bordered on the bizarre. the government was so keenly interpreting a sentence in the labour party’s manifesto that at one point, lord phillips of sudbury remarked: “it staggers me that we are still discussing that point. try that argument out on anyone in the high street or in a pub and you will get an ‘are you mad?’ look.”, the labour party’s 2005 manifesto had said: “we will introduce id cards, including biometric data like fingerprints, backed up by a national register and rolling out initially on a voluntary basis as people renew their passports.” in other words, while renewing passports, citizens could choose whether to apply for an id card. however, the government decided to insist on id cards while renewing passports. home secretary charles clarke offered the justification that “passports are voluntary documents.” when the house burst into laughter and jeers, mr. clarke clarified: “well, of course they are… no one is forced to renew a passport if they choose not to do so!”, for mr. clarke, “voluntary” pertained to whether one wanted a passport, and not whether one wanted an id card. edward garnier, a conservative member, suggested, “the problem facing the government is that they have as usual misused the english language.” lord phillips said: “i am afraid that my primary schoolteacher, miss lovelace, would have given mr. clarke 0 out of 10 for that.”, a similar drama has been unfolding in india since 2009. is aadhaar compulsory? if so, what is its legal basis? without aadhaar, can one buy subsidised cooking gas? the united progressive alliance government’s response to these questions is marked by “intentional ambiguity”; the phrase was originally used by edgar whitley and gus hosein in their research on the u.k. id cards programme. the strategy of “intentional ambiguity” has had elements of obfuscation, misinterpretation, inconsistency and dishonesty., camouflage job the first attempt of the government at obfuscation was on the relationship of aadhaar with the home ministry’s national register of indian citizens (nric). the unique identification authority of india (uidai) was conceptualised in the mid-2000s as a technical agency attached to the home ministry. the uidai was to de-duplicate biometric data of citizens collected under the multipurpose national identity card (mnic) project and link it with nric. registration into the nric was compulsory after the passage of the citizenship (amendment) act of 2003 (there is no place for biometrics in nric under the 2003 act, but let us defer that discussion)., however, when established in 2009, the uidai was attached to the planning commission with a proposed “developmental” objective. yet, the national identity number in the nric and aadhaar were nothing but the same. a strategy was then evolved with two objectives: (a) camouflage aadhaar’s unceasing security dimension, and (b) ensure faster enrolment into the uidai database. thus, officially, the government held that aadhaar was voluntary. on its website, the uidai still introduces aadhaar as “a voluntary service that every resident can avail irrespective of present documentation.”, in practice, the policy took a different trajectory. first, in the same breath that it denied that there was any security dimension to aadhaar, the uidai piggybacked on the home ministry and designated the census commissioner as its registrar. thus, whoever enrolled into nric automatically received an aadhaar number. second, the uidai attempted to cajole public service providers to make service provision contingent on the submission of aadhaar. for such public services, the uidai had a name: “killer applications.” in 2010, a uidai document argued: “every citizen must have a strong incentive or a ‘killer application’ to go and get herself a uid, which one could think of as a demand side pull.”, over time, leading proponents came out clearly on the government’s real intentions. at davos in january 2011, dr. montek singh ahluwalia spoke most directly: “we will simply make it compulsory for those benefiting from government programmes to register for the uid number.” the same month, mr. nandan nilekani made a daring attempt to sanitise the term compulsory: “yes, aadhaar is voluntary. but the service providers might make it mandatory. in the long run i wouldn’t call it compulsory. i’d rather say it will become ubiquitous.” in what was a reactionary spin on the rights-based framework, mr. nilekani stated in november 2012: “if you do not have the aadhaar card, you will not get the right to rights.” obfuscation was giving way to misinterpretation., there was a method behind the mad hurry to force enrolment. elections were drawing near and the government needed to showcase one application that effectively “leveraged aadhaar.” further, the prime minister was eager to expedite the use of aadhaar in social sector schemes to further targeting and cut fiscal deficit. thus, the direct benefit transfer (dbt) programme in the provision of gas cylinders was chosen as the prime “killer application.” there were smaller killers too: for not having aadhaar, post-matriculation scholarships were withheld for dalit and adivasi students; provident fund transactions were disallowed for salaried employees; salaries were not paid to government employees in maharashtra; even marriage registrations were disallowed in delhi. for the future, the option of cash transfer was kept open when the food security act was passed., scared, people ran from pillar to post for aadhaar. a delighted mr. nilekani declared that indians had “voted with their feet” for aadhaar. having forced more people to enrol, the government billed the dbt programme as a “gamechanger.” however, the upa’s ministers themselves openly differed on the utility of the scheme. on december 22, 2012, mr. p. chidambaram claimed that the >dbt scheme was “pure magic.” just two weeks later, mr. jairam ramesh disagreed; dbt was an “experiment,” and not a single “jaadu ki chhadi magic wand”., anger and harassment by then, however, public anger was building up. more people began to detest the imposition of indirect compulsoriness. threats posed by the project were being discussed on a wider scale. but most importantly, enrolment of residents, the generation of aadhaar and the seeding of aadhaar into bank accounts were all proceeding very slowly. gas agencies regularly harassed consumers with threats of ending subsidised provision of cylinders. members of parliament raised the issue in parliament. in 2013, planning minister rajiv shukla made the assurance that, “aadhaar card is not mandatory to avail subsidised facilities being offered by the government like lpg cylinders, admission in private aided schools, opening a savings account, etc.”, still, there was no end to harassment by gas agencies. on august 23, 2013, a rajya sabha member pointed out the inconsistency in the government’s actions. >mr. shukla replied: “it would not be made mandatory. it is not mandatory. if any public sector undertaking is doing it, we will correct it.”, the relief lasted just four days. in a shocking act of dishonesty, the ministry of petroleum and natural gas issued a notification on august 27 titled “aadhaar mandatory to avail lpg subsidy.” like mr. clarke had done, this notification literally turned the idea of voluntariness on its head. it stated that voluntariness applied only to the purchase of cylinders at subsidised prices, and not to the purchase of cylinders itself; even without aadhaar, consumers could continue to buy cylinders at the non-subsidised price.",0.03582080200501253,compulsion stealth,"“this debate … specific disagreement meaning one word , ” i.e. “the government seek persuade us ‘voluntary ’ actually means ‘compulsory ’ . ” , nick clegg united kingdom ’ house commons march 2006. mr. clegg others opposing labour government ’ decision renew passports applicants possess national id card. debate , apart hilarious , bordered bizarre. government keenly interpreting sentence labour party ’ manifesto one point , lord phillips sudbury remarked : “it staggers still discussing point. try argument anyone high street pub get ‘are mad? ’ look. ” , labour party ’ 2005 manifesto said : “we introduce id cards , including biometric data like fingerprints , backed national register rolling initially voluntary basis people renew passports. ” words , renewing passports , citizens could choose whether apply id card. however , government decided insist id cards renewing passports. home secretary charles clarke offered justification “passports voluntary documents. ” house burst laughter jeers , mr. clarke clarified : “well , course … one forced renew passport choose ! ” , mr. clarke , “voluntary ” pertained whether one wanted passport , whether one wanted id card. edward garnier , conservative member , suggested , “the problem facing government usual misused english language. ” lord phillips said : “i afraid primary schoolteacher , miss lovelace , would given mr. clarke 0 10 that. ” , similar drama unfolding india since 2009. aadhaar compulsory ? , legal basis ? without aadhaar , one buy subsidised cooking gas ? united progressive alliance government ’ response questions marked “intentional ambiguity ” ;

2014-02-11,soul song,"b. pasubathy, r. vicky, a. ismail, and a. kaadhar sing gaana at doomming kuppam beach. photo: m. karunakaran | photo credit: m_karunakaran , he wipes down tables in a hotel; picks rags on the roadside; washes tea glasses at an eatery; sells vegetables on the pavement… after a hard day’s work that drains him, there is one thing that the less-privileged man of chennai does to recharge himself — he sings. this song has no rules or boundaries; he is its master. the tune is from his head; the lyrics are from his life. it’s gaana. he will lounge with his friends on the bench of a neighbourhood teashop, at the mosquito-filled precincts of the kuppam’s temple, or on the cool sands of the marina at night and sing as the rest of the city sleeps and the kuppam stays wide awake., chennai is the birthplace of gaana — a genre of music popularised by tamil cinema; it is straight from the heart of the marginalised people. gaana’s beginning cannot be traced, says v. ramakrishnan, a professor of tamil literature who holds a phd in gaana. “it is ageless. this genre is chennai’s very own folk music.” ramakrishnan has written the book gaana paadalgal: chennai adithala makkal varalaru, in which he details the gaana tradition., gaana singers sing of love, life, death, their day-to-day problems… the songs are sometimes profound — don’t let the simple lyrics fool you. ramakrishnan says that gaana has traces of siddhar paadalgal, hindustani, and islamic music sung by kunangudi masthan sahib, a saint who is said to have lived in north madras decades ago., how would one describe gaana? lilting? fast-paced? melodic? kaadhar, a 17-year-old resident of doomming kuppam off the marina, shows that it is a mix of all the above. we sit facing the sea, surrounded by heaps of fishing nets as he reels off a gaana he sang at his father’s funeral. his voice defeats the monotonous ‘shhhhh’ of the waves; you hear nothing but the song sung by a son when he lost his father. “enna vittu pona appa…” he begins, singing of how his mother noor is waiting for his father vaas to return. gaana is popular in funerals — kaadhar’s friend vicky informs us that those who can afford it organise gaana kutcheris at the funerals of their loved ones., ‘marana gaana’ viji’s is a well-known voice in such kutcheris. orphaned when he was a little boy, viji grew up listening to gaana songs. he is also a researcher of the genre. “a gaana singer raises his voice from the pit of the stomach. the voice is thrown with force,” he says. the lyrics consist of typical madras baashai (dialect) — they have a smattering of english words, and sometimes telugu, kannada, hindi, and malayalam words, explains viji., there are also gaana songs calling for social change. “i sing of revolution, social, and environmental issues such as how the ocean is being polluted,” says viji. college boys in the city can be heard singing peppy gaana songs in buses to impress the girls., ramakrishnan says that there are also women who can sing good gaana. he has interacted with singers shanthi, the sister of gaana guru ‘aayiram vilakku’ selvam and padmini from kotturpuram for his upcoming book., mani, jagan, vinodh, dinesh, palani… the youngsters at doomming kuppam reel off names of the current crop of gaana singers who are creating waves. the kids store the songs of these artistes on their mobile phones. “i sing gaana when i walk back home after a football match if i’m in a good mood,” says vicky. “i sing in the class too when there is a free period,” he smiles., gaana can be fun, cheeky, romantic, and serious; it can also be a meaningless bunch of words connected together for just good music. kaadhar picks a thermocol float from a nearby boat and taps it as he sings for us the ‘share-auto song’ (see box).“, while gaana fascinates with its clarity of expression, it sometimes startles you with its ruthless honesty. for instance, vicky’s song ‘vidha vidhama matta caseu en mela’. it is about a man who laments about how he is pursued by the police. he sleeps outside his home one night and the police come to get him. he gives them the slip by hurling sand at their eyes. but they whip their guns out… “my grandfather told me this story,” explains vicky. “it happened to him when he was young.” suddenly, there is a commotion in the kuppam — a police car has just pulled over. “ennada nadakkudhu (what’s happening)?” wonders vicky. the boys run to find out. perhaps they will sing of it someday., on their lives, vidha vidhama matta case-u en mela, naa odi odi oliyurene unnala, thirundhi vaazha mudiyalaye ennala, share auto song, share-auto share-auto, janangalukku porattam, anju roova kayila kudutha, parakkuranga plane-aatom, aerunga ma aerunga share autovila aerunga…, a fun song",0.11015522875816992,soul song,"b. pasubathy , r. vicky , a. ismail , a. kaadhar sing gaana doomming kuppam beach. photo : m. karunakaran &#124; photo credit : m_karunakaran , wipes tables hotel ; picks rags roadside ; washes tea glasses eatery ; sells vegetables pavement … hard day ’ work drains , one thing less-privileged man chennai recharge — sings. song rules boundaries ; master. tune head ; lyrics life. ’ gaana. lounge friends bench neighbourhood teashop , mosquito-filled precincts kuppam ’ temple , cool sands marina night sing rest city sleeps kuppam stays wide awake. , chennai birthplace gaana — genre music popularised tamil cinema ; straight heart marginalised people. gaana ’ beginning cannot traced , says v. ramakrishnan , professor tamil literature holds phd gaana. “it ageless. genre chennai ’ folk music. ” ramakrishnan written book gaana paadalgal : chennai adithala makkal varalaru , details gaana tradition. , gaana singers sing love , life , death , day-to-day problems … songs sometimes profound — ’ let simple lyrics fool you. ramakrishnan says gaana traces siddhar paadalgal , hindustani , islamic music sung kunangudi masthan sahib , saint said lived north madras decades ago. , would one describe gaana ?

2014-03-06,no benefits for beneficiaries,"jharkhand was one of five pilot states chosen for an aadhaar-enabled payment system (aeps). beginning with mahatma gandhi national rural employment guarantee act (mgnrega) payments in select blocks in four districts in 2012, aeps added pension and scholarship schemes and the janani suraksha yojana scheme in the second phase and extended to three more districts in 2013., nearly three years after the government began experimenting with aadhaar-based payments in jharkhand, it has still not been able to start disbursing payments to beneficiaries at their doorstep as envisioned. the push towards getting beneficiaries enrolled in aadhaar continues in jharkhand, but in several instances, this is done with the threat of exclusion from existing benefits., a beneficiary’s aadhaar is “seeded” in the government’s database. banks carry out the same procedure for their account holders. banks then report the fact of the aadhaar having been seeded to the national payments corporation of india (npci) for “mapping” in its database. after all three steps have been completed, a beneficiary can electronically receive the subsidy through an aadhaar payment bridge system. then, a banking correspondent, whether appointed by a bank or a post office, acts as an automated teller machine (atm) for the village or household by making the payment after scanning the fingerprints of beneficiaries. used in conjunction with a hand-held device/micro-atm, this biometric system functions as the personal identification number (pin) of a beneficiary., in jharkhand, there have been concerted enrolment drives since 2011, but the beneficiaries of various schemes with aadhaar and aadhaar-mapped accounts constitute less than 20 per cent. the numbers are still too low to shift to aeps, say officials., in ramgarh district, for instance, a model district as far as aadhar penetration is concerned, and where aadhaar pilots were launched in 2012, enrolment is over 82 per cent of the nine-lakh strong population. but the number of aadhaar-mapped accounts is 37,938, i.e., less than four per cent. examining the numbers for individual schemes, in mgnrega for example — the scheme in which the state government first started linking beneficiary details with aadhaar — of 1.91 lakh workers in ramgarh, only 21,110 have aadhaar-mapped accounts, i.e., 11 per cent. the corresponding numbers are lower in ranchi and hazaribagh — also pilot districts — at over seven per cent and five per cent respectively., “even after beneficiaries enrolled, they had to be physically located to collect their data, which took time. banks neither deployed staff to seed data at their end, nor did they forward mapping requests to npci,” says n.n. sinha, prinicipal secretary, information technology., slow switch to post officesthe bank of india, which has a sizeable network of branches in jharkhand and was the first to migrate to an aadhaar-based platform, has been unable to rid the processes of glitches. for instance, none of the banking correspondents it employed during pilots in ranchi in the tarup, tigra and purio panchayats in 2012 has been paid wages for over a year now. under the original plan, the correspondents were to earn two per cent of all transactions as commission. ranchi’s lead district manager s. ghosal explains this by saying that “technical errors” were behind transactions not being reflected in the bank’s management information system (mis). as a result, invoices could not be prepared., further, the two crucial elements of last-mile delivery — “a dense, interoperable network of banking correspondents,” and biometric devices such as micro-atms or tablets with fingerprint scanners — are still not in place. the state chief secretary, r.s. sharma, previously the director-general, unique identification authority of india (uidai), identified poor cooperation from banks as being the main limiting factor. “for banks, this is simply not a priority. they did not hire banking correspondents or purchase micro-atms even after being granted a rs.15,000 subsidy from the government. banks were not interested at all.”, taking cognisance of the tardy response from banks, and recognising that over two-thirds of beneficiaries in schemes such as mgnrega and pension plans hold post office accounts, the government now plans to start aeps in post offices. on october 2, 2013, the union minister for rural development, jairam ramesh, inaugurated aadhaar-enabled payments by micro-atm in lali panchayat on the outskirts of ranchi., but since then — when three mgnrega workers were paid at the function — only 15 workers have been paid using the micro-atm. “the machine stopped working in mid-october. for six weeks, there was no replacement. sometimes there is no ‘line’ (power failures), and at other times, no connectivity,” says the officer at the post office, jairam mahto, while taking the micro-atm out of a cupboard in his office. of 540 “active” mgnrega workers, seeding was done for 190; the figure was much lower for mapping. the government now plans to purchase 2,800 hand-held devices worth rs.4.8 crore for post offices., in ranchi, senior officials say that while they still prefer the aadhaar route because it allows “interoperability” — the linking of different uid-enabled databases — they are now coming around to acknowledging that a majority of beneficiaries still do not have aadhaar-seeded and mapped accounts. instead of biometrics, the government now plans to start payments in post offices based on a system of “one time password” verification sent to the mobile phones of beneficiaries registered on the databases of schemes., disruptions for beneficiariesthere is another factor. the government may be beginning to search for alternatives to a biometrics-based, universal database it had set out to create. however, in the rush to enrol and map accounts, beneficiaries already face the prospect of being left out., in its interim order on september 23, 2013, the supreme court said that aadhaar cannot be made mandatory to access government schemes, but investigation reveals another story. in the implementation of individual schemes, aadhaar has de facto been made mandatory. in mgnrega, for instance, when district officials found it difficult to locate workers enrolled in the job scheme, they decided to focus on “active” workers — those who had worked in the scheme in the last or current year. who was a genuine beneficiary or not was to be determined after holding gram sabhas, but in ranchi and adjoining khunti district this was seldom done., “while seeding and freezing details, we could not find workers in remote areas such as lapung. this lowered the percentage of seeding. there was a lot of pressure. in some instances, the staff resorted to removing workers from the mis. i have received reports that workers in some villages resisted being deleted from lists when they found this out later,” says a district project officer in ranchi. records show that 2,211 workers’ cards were permanently deleted and 11,234 workers “tagged as deleted” — i.e. the cards have been temporarily marked as deleted but could be used if the worker applied afresh for work. even those who reapply for work will have to submit their aadhaar numbers or the eid, a provisional number given at the time of enrolment in aadhaar, or face the threat of being excluded from the job scheme., if among all districts in the state, khunti has the highest ratio of 78 per cent of “active” mgnrega workers, and whose details are seeded with aadhaar, beneficiaries have one person to thank for this — mr. mukesh kumar. under his eagle eye and guidance, senior officials set up a district control room for aadhaar, went to panchayats to seed data manually and hired local private computer centres to digitise the data when banks were reluctant to undertake this job. “i organised training sessions, met with panchayat representatives and explained that this is pavitra karya orsacred work since there is no ulterior motive,” says mr. kumar, who was the district collector till early february., there have been instances of coercion too. a letter by mr. kumar, as the khunti deputy commissioner and dated january 25, 2014 to all block development officers (bdos), says they would face showcause notices if aadhaar seeding targets were not met. the same day, letters by the deputy development commissioner and nodal officer, aadhaar, stopped salary payments to all bdos, panchayat sewaks and rozgar sewaks till further orders as they had “failed to achieve 100 per cent seeding.”",0.0047619047619047615,benefits beneficiaries,"jharkhand one five pilot states chosen aadhaar-enabled

2014-05-17,comprehensive win,"while it is an astounding victory for mr. narendra modi, the bharatiya janata party and the national democratic alliance, nobody could have imagined that the congress would bite the dust in this manner, with a margin that eclipsed even the wildest exit poll predictions., mr. modi has proved that he is no ordinary political leader but a strategist who has put every political challenger including regional leaders in his/her/their place. it is an electoral earthquake, especially for those who oppose mr. modi. many of us need to understand where we went wrong in our assessment of the might of this man who we seem to have misread so badly., yogeshwar davar,, new delhi, it is heartening to note that we are back to the era of single-party rule. it is time for the new government to put into action all assurances it made in its manifesto and during campaigning. the bjp needs to usher in bold reforms to energise the economy. this time round, there is no excuse to pass around of coalition dharma and errant allies. at the same time, the stunning mandate should not be misconstrued as an approval for implementing a divisive agenda., sekhar rayaprolu,, secunderabad, after a decade of coalition politics, the people of india have finally understood the price that one has to pay to move forward on development and also to get everyone on board on specific issues. another is the caste and communal card that parties have been sticking to versus agendas of governance., madhusree guha,, kolkata, while one can say that it was the better marketing strategy of mr. modi’s that propelled the bjp to power, the mandate seems to be more a reaction to the large-scale corruption unleashed by the upa, a sluggish economy and price rise. on many an occasion, the government looked ineffective. there were also many flip-flops on welfare schemes, an example being the aadhar-linking exercise., k.a. solaman,, alappuzha, projection of the prospect of single-party rule, a strong will and courage of conviction with a willingness to highlight the experiment of development in a leading state on a national platform are the ingredients of the bjp’s comprehensive win. as for the congress, it was all about corruption, confusion and chaos, paralysed governance, weak leadership, sycophants and unimpressive spokespersons. it seems to be a party with immense talent but one which never learns lessons from the past., v. rajagopal,, tirupati, one knew about the anti-incumbency wave, but never expected the scale of the congress’s defeat. in its defeat, the party’s contingent of media spokespersons have only turned out to be the great spoilers. instead of accepting wrongdoing, they are doing more damage by shielding their top brass. in the end, the clever voter spoke., mudgal venkatesh,, gulbarga, as a towering model of democracy, india has once again upheld its high standards, beliefs and the spirit of democracy. making this great feat possible, the people have given their ultimate verdict. the mandate should be read as a yearning for a paradigm change and a clean india. the thumping victory may have brought great joy in the bjp's inner circle, but it also highlights the unspoken responsibilities that need now to be shouldered., finally, one should not forget the efforts of the true musketeer, the election commission of india, and the complex logistical task it undertook. the interview, “we are into election management, we do not get into the nitty-gritty: sampath” (may 16) was enlightening., arjun r. shankar,, thiruvananthapuram, the congress party could have avoided its ignoble defeat had the upa government admitted its lapses and initiated course correction after the exposure of the 2g spectrum scam. it paid the price for its brazen defiance of public opinion., it is hoped that mr. modi will view the bjp's victory as an endorsement of his promise for decisive governance and not for divisive politics., v.n. mukundarajan,, thiruvananthapuram, mr. modi overcame all the odds of a relentless vilification campaign by an allegedly neutral (english language) media and a continuous barrage of vitriolic remarks by so-called intellectuals. edmund burke, that doyen among british parliamentarians, once said: “plain good intention which is as easily discovered at the first view as fraud is surely detected at last, is, let me say, of no mean force in the government of mankind.”, n. parthasarathy,, tiruchi, let us hope that mr. modi, who is mainly instrumental for this great victory, will do his best to make india a progressive, peaceful and prosperous country, treating all people, whatever their language, culture or religion, as one. there is no doubt that people have voted for change. the new government must stand only for “progress and prosperity” and nothing else., it is also, as leading academician zoya hasan said on television, the first time in the world that a right-wing government has been given such a massive mandate. in such a situation, there needs to be a strong and secular opposition., v.m. khaleelur rahman,, chennai, with the bjp/nda all set to come

political issues that need to be addressed is the issue of violence along communal lines, rampant in assam’s bodoland area. this is something that the upa failed to address in 2012. if the bjp deals

aspirations and the belief that these could be realized through democratic processes, has been amply reflected in the record 66.4% participation by voters, and a clear verdict in favour of a single political party after a gap of nearly 30 years. the electorate transcended the boundaries of caste, creed, region and religion to come together and vote decisively in favour of development through good governance., 5.the country needed a strong and stable government that could provide effective leadership. in my republic day speech earlier this year, i had hoped for 2014 to be a year of healing after the fractured and contentious politics of the previous years. standing here today, i applaud the wisdom of my fellow citizens for having voted for stability, honesty and development in a resurgent india in which corruption will have no place. they have voted for a united, strong, and modern india - “ek bharat - shreshtha bharat”. my government will work to fulfill these aspirations; with the involvement of all the 125 crore people of this great country., 6.my government is committed to nurturing the right environment for actualizing this mandate of the people. for this, it pledges itself to the principle of ‘sabka saath, sabka vikas’; which can be fulfilled only through your active participation. we will work together to re-establish the credibility of the institutions of democracy. my government will function on the mantra of ‘minimum government, maximum governance’. in all our actions, we will be guided by the core values of our great civilization., honourable members, 7.my government is dedicated to the poor. poverty has no religion, hunger has no creed, and despair has no geography. the greatest challenge before us is to end the curse of poverty in india. my government will not be satisfied with mere “poverty alleviation”; and commits itself to the goal of “poverty elimination”. with a firm belief that the first claim on development belongs to the poor; the government will focus its attention on those who need the basic necessities of life most urgently. it will take necessary steps to provide security in its entirety to all citizens; through empathy, support and empowerment., 8.containing food inflation will be the topmost priority for my government. there would be an emphasis on improving the supply side of various agro and agro-based products. my government will take effective steps to prevent hoarding and black marketing. it will reform the public distribution system, incorporating best practices from the states. my government is alert about the possibility of a subnormal monsoon this year and contingency plans are being prepared., 9.despite more than two-thirds of our people living in rural areas; we have not been able to provide adequate public amenities and livelihood opportunities to them. my government is committed to improving the quality of life in our villages, through empowered panchayati raj institutions. a substantial part of investment will focus on creating community assets and improving basic infrastructure such as roads, shelter, power and drinking water. my government will strive to end the rural-urban divide guided by the idea of rurban; providing urban amenities to rural areas while preserving the ethos of the villages., 10.agriculture is the source of livelihood for majority of our people. in the recent past, our farmers have been under severe stress with hopelessness driving some of them to suicides. my government is committed to reversing this unfortunate trend. it will increase investment in agriculture, both public and private, especially in agri-infrastructure. steps will be taken to convert farming into a profitable venture through scientific practices and agro-technology. my government will address issues pertaining to pricing and procurement of agricultural produce, crop insurance and post-harvest management. productivity of animal husbandry will be

high priority to water security. it will complete the long pending irrigation projects on priority and launch the ‘pradhan mantri krishi sinchayee yojana’ with the motto of ‘har khet ko paani’. there is a need for seriously considering all options including linking of rivers, where feasible; for ensuring optimal use of our water resources to prevent the recurrence of floods and drought. by harnessing rain water through ‘jal sanchay’ and ‘jal sinchan’, we will nurture water conservation and ground water recharge. micro irrigation will be popularised to ensure ‘per drop-more crop’., honourable members, 12.india is the world’s oldest civilization. today it is also a country with the largest population of the youth. we must equip and nurture our youth with the right kind of education, skill-set and opportunity to reap this demographic dividend. my government will strive to transition from youth development to youth-led development. it will set up massive open online courses and virtual classrooms. it will formulate a national education policy aimed at meeting the challenges posed by lack of quality, research and innovation in our educational institutions. we will set up iits and iims in every state. in order to empower school teachers and students, a national e-library will be established. with the motto of “har haath ko hunar”, my government will strive to break the barriers between formal education and skill development, and put in place a mechanism to give academic equivalence to vocational qualifications. with the goal of skilled india, my government will also launch a national multi-skill mission., 13. the children and youth of the country need avenues of recreation that develop them constructively and keep them fit. my government will launch a ‘national sports talent search system’. it will facilitate development and promotion of indian sports, particularly rural sports. sports will be popularised by making it an integral part of the school curriculum and providing educational incentives., 14.our country needs a holistic health care system that is universally accessible, affordable and effective. to achieve this objective, my government

training will be transformed. aiims like institutes will be established in every state in a phased manner., 15.we must not tolerate the indignity of homes without toilets and public spaces littered

anniversary to be celebrated in the year 2019., 16.keeping in mind welfare of the people belonging to the scheduled castes, scheduled tribes, other backward classes and the weaker sections of our society; my government will take steps to create an enabling eco-system of equal opportunity in education, health and livelihood. my government is committed to see that those belonging to the scheduled castes and other backward classes are able to avail emerging opportunities. for the scheduled tribes, my government will launch a dedicated “van bandhu kalyan yojana”. electrification of tribal hamlets and connecting them with all-weather roads will be a priority area., 17.it is unfortunate that even after several decades of independence, sections of minority communities continue to suffer from poverty, as benefits of government schemes do not reach them. my government is committed to making all minorities equal partners in india’s progress. the government will especially strengthen measures to spread modern and technical education among minority communities and a national madarsa modernization programme will be initiated., 18.the welfare and rehabilitation of specially-abled people is integral to my government’s vision of a caring society. it will take steps to provide dignity of life to them by facilitating their participation in all walks of life. steps will be taken to identify their special needs and to provide institutional care to them., 19.my government recognizes the important role our women play in the development of our society and growth of the nation. it is committed to providing 33 per cent reservation to them in the parliament and state legislative assemblies. with a commitment of “beti bachao - beti padhao”, my government will launch a mass campaign for saving the girl child and enabling her education. it will structure a comprehensive scheme, incorporating best practices from states in this regard. in the recent past, the country has witnessed some grue some incidents of violence against women. the government will have a policy of zero tolerance for violence against women, and will strengthen the criminal justice system for its effective implementation., honourable members, 20.india is a federal polity. but, over the years, the federal spirit has been diluted. the states and the centre should function as an organic team india. in order to actively engage with the states on national issues, my government will reinvigorate fora like the national development council and the inter-state council. the centre will be an enabler in the rapid progress of states through cooperative federalism. state-specific development models will be developed taking into account the special needs and unique problems of coastal, hilly and desert areas. highest priority will be accorded to bring eastern region of the country on par with western region in terms of physical and social infrastructure. my government is committed to addressing the issues relating to development of andhra pradesh and telangana. the government will lay special emphasis on improving the intra-region connectivity and border infrastructure in the

will be completed. special efforts will be made to ensure that kashmiri pandits return to the land of their ancestors with full dignity, security and assured livelihood., 21.my government is committed to providing a clean and efficient administration focussed on delivery. the institution of lok pal is important to curb corruption and my government will endeavour to formulate rules in conformity with the act. my government will take steps to build the confidence and morale of our bureaucracy; enabling it with the freedom to work, and welcoming innovative ideas. the government will stress on putting in place transparent systems and timebound delivery of government services. government systems and processes will be revisited to make them citizen friendly, corruption free and accountable.

in policy making and administration., 23.my government is determined to rid the country of the scourge of corruption and the menace of black money. as a first step in this direction, the government has already constituted a sit to unearth black money stashed abroad. this will be followed up vigorously by proactively engaging with foreign governments., 24.keeping in mind that justice delayed is justice denied, my government will adopt a multi-pronged approach to address the problem of high pendency of cases in our judicial system. it will progressively modernize the courts to improve their operational efficiency, and start reform of the criminal justice system to make dispensation of justice simpler, quicker and more effective. it will initiate a mission mode project for filling vacancies in the judiciary and for doubling the number of courts and judges in the subordinate judiciary in a phased manner. the government will give special emphasis to the development of alternate dispute resolution mechanisms., honourable members, 25.on the economic front, we are passing through an extremely difficult phase. for two consecutive years, our gdp growth has been less than 5 per cent. tax collection has declined. inflation continues to be at an unacceptable level. thus, putting the indian economy back on track is paramount for my government. we will work together to usher our economy into a high growth path, rein in inflation, reignite the investment cycle, accelerate job creation and restore the confidence of the domestic as well as international community in our economy., 26.my government will create a policy environment which is predictable, transparent and fair. it will embark on rationalisation and simplification of the tax regime to make it non-adversarial and conducive to investment, enterprise and growth. my government will make every effort to introduce the gst while addressing the concerns of states. reforms will be undertaken to enhance the ease of doing business. my government will follow a policy of encouraging investments, including through fdi; which will be allowed in sectors that help create jobs and assets., 27.for rapid creation of jobs in the manufacturing sector, the government will strategically promote labour-intensive manufacturing. employment opportunities will also be expanded by promoting tourism and agro-based industries. my government will transform employment exchanges into career centres - connecting our youth with job opportunities in a transparent and effective manner through the use of technology as well as through counselling and training. the government will strengthen the pension and health insurance safety nets for labour force of all categories and would provide them access to modern financial services., 28.we need to transform ourselves into a globally competitive manufacturing hub powered by skill, scale and speed. to this end, the government will set up world class investment and industrial regions, particularly along the dedicated freight corridors and industrial corridors spanning the country. my government will encourage the domestic industry to innovate and

revamping of railways is on top of the infrastructure agenda. my government will launch a diamond quadrilateral project of high speed trains. the country will have a network of freight corridors with specialised agri-rail networks for perishable agricultural products. investment in railways will be increased using innovative financing methods. expansion of railways in hilly states and northeast

civil nuclear agreements will be operationalized and nuclear power projects for civilian purposes will be developed., 32.my government is conscious of the fact that our urban infrastructure is under severe stress. soon, 50 per cent of our population would be residing in urban areas. taking urbanization as an opportunity rather than a challenge, the government will build 100 cities focussed on specialized domains and equipped with world class amenities. integrated infrastructure will be rolled out in model towns to focus on cleanliness and sanitation. by the time the nation completes 75 years of its independence, every family will have a pucca house with water connection, toilet facilities, 24x7 electricity supply and access., honourable members, 33.while putting the country on a high growth path, my government will keep sustainability at the core of our planning process. my government strongly believes that environmental conservation can go hand in hand with development. to

discretionary powers in allocation of our precious natural resources. the government will formulate clear and transparent policies on allocation of critical natural resources such as coal, minerals and spectrum., 35.river ganga is a part of our rich cultural heritage, a symbol of faith and the lifeline for millions. however, ganga continues to remain polluted with many stretches of the river becoming dry in lean season. my government will take all necessary steps to ensure a perennial, clean and pristine ganga., 36.our rich cultural heritage is the very foundation on which rests the unity

defence and spur industrial development as well as exports., 41.the country is proud of its armed forces. they serve the nation with professionalism, dedication and valour; securing our nation and

the global crisis of 2007 had provided just the right spur. upa-ii would undertake significant reforms well before the next round of elections loomed. unfortunately, the reformers were roundly disappointed. the nda was said to be better placed than any government since the nineties, as the bjp had a majority of its own in the lok sabha and could easily make course corrections in the first couple of years. india’s reformers must marvel at the perversity of the indian political class., the reformers just don’t get it. if two different coalitions that span virtually the entire political spectrum cannot undertake some measures or do something to the contrary, it must be because of the demands of the political economy. as the economist joseph stigltiz once said, measures that are populist are also genuinely popular., ‘second generation’ reformsthe >reforms of the nineties were relatively easy to push through because the benefits clearly outweighed the short-term as well as long-term costs. the same cannot be said of the ‘second generation’ reforms. these entail substantial costs in the short-run and the benefits are not unambiguous nor can they be attained unless certain conditions are met.",0.03682659932659933,"short-term costs , long-term benefits","chennai , 19-02-2009 : hyundai plant facility irungattukottai near chennai. photo : s_r_raghunathan &#124;

2014-08-24,commissioning a new plan,"with the announcement of the demise of the planning commission by the prime minister, many obituaries of the commission are being written. however, it is worth remembering that the east asian superstars of development all had planning as a key part of their development programme. south korea had a powerful economic planning board (epb) which guided development programmes in three decades since 1962. china has had a continuum of plans with the xii five year plan going up to 2015. india too simply cannot achieve its development objectives without some sort of planning., it should be clearly understood that a pure market economy is inconsistent with bjp’s much admired vision: sabka vikas, sabke sath. it is also inconsistent with the prime minister’s call in his independence day speech to rise above “me-ism”. votaries of pure market economy emphasize, as the father of modern market economics adam smith did, that markets ensure that individuals taking care of their own interests lead to social good. in that philosophy, there is no need to think of the country or of its development or of the welfare of all. but markets by themselves will not ensure swachha bharat or shauchalaya for women in rural areas. in general, ‘development’ is not market’s business just as business may not be government’s business. if we want development, we need the government’s help and that needs planning of some sort or other. the only question is what the new avatar of planning will look like. let me suggest some features of that new avatar., suggested namelet us begin with the name. i suggest national development commission (ndc), which, while simple, includes all development-related activities such as policy reforms, investment programmes, regulations, social marketing, consensus-building and the like. the alternative that is being bandied about (‘national development and reforms commission’) makes an unnatural distinction between development and reforms. development is the objective; reforms are but one instrument., blueprintthe objective of ndc will be to prepare blueprints, help design action programmes, and monitor and evaluate outcomes to achieve the goal of “sabka vikas, sabke sath”. ndc will define what ‘vikas’ will mean for india of the 21st century. one possible definition could be that india would become a high-income country by 2050 when it celebrates the centenary of the republic. but prosperity will be not just in economic dimension but also social, cultural and spiritual dimensions. in short, the goal will be that india, with the largest number of people in the world in 2050, will also be number one country in the world., in preparing the blueprint for india as no.1, ndc will bring long-term perspectives which are generally missing in operating ministries fighting day-to-day battles. such long-term perspectives are important because in many areas (such as human capital formation) gestation lag is long. similarly, in many areas (such as infrastructure) what we do today will bind us for the next 40-50 years. climate change issues will become serious over a long period but mitigation and adaptation measures have to start now. if we wait for the consequences of climate change to become evident, it will be too late. the second area where ndc will contribute is to take fully into account the connectivity between sectoral programmes. it is well-known that different operating ministries operate as silos (and even jagirs as the prime minister mentioned in his independence day speech) while in real life their operations are connected. for highlighting these links and achieve “optimum utilisation of resources” a central economic agency is needed., co-ordinationndc will be the agency to co-ordinate policy issues where different ministries are working with their own imperatives and mindsets. energy policy, transport policy, urbanisation policy, water policy, land policy all require inter-ministerial co-ordination which only a central agency such as ndc can provide. in addition to preparing national long-term blueprint, ndc will help each state and union territory to prepare its own long-term blueprints. the task will be managed by states and uts but ndc will provide financial and intellectual support as needed., by producing blueprints on which there can be a national consensus, ndc will help in making development a mass movement similar to what was done at the time of freedom struggle. all individuals at different levels will understand what the nation is trying to achieve and how it is in the interest of all and requires support of all. this will help in ensuring that steps of 1.25 billion people are in the same direction and not cancelling each other’s efforts. in the light of nationally agreed long-term blueprints, operating ministries will prepare detailed annual action programmes/budgets in consultation with the ministry of finance and with right to comment by ndc. the prime minister’s office (pmo) will decide in cases of conflicting views., allocation of resourcesthe allocation of financial resources between states and the centre will be the function of the finance commission. however, there would be many central projects (for example, in railways, ports, shipping, education and health) where the allocation of resources by the centre will have an obvious spatial pattern and thus impinge on states’ development. for these expenditure by the centre, ndc will be a forum for ensuring inter-state balance with full participation of the states., monitoring and evaluation of the programmes will be an important function of ndc. this will focus not on auditing functions but on effectiveness and efficiency of the operations in achieving the objectives. ndc will report to pmo for follow-up and necessary actions.",0.120774425995945,commissioning new plan,"announcement demise

months., the first official hint that india was undertaking a mission to mars came in the budget speech of 2012. subsequently, prime minister manmohan singh formally declared in his independence day speech that year that an indian mission was heading to mars. the mission itself was launched on a balmy afternoon on november 5, 2013, and the journey from the red fort to the red planet has had a dream run., on his last visit to isro, when he witnessed the launch of a polar satellite launch vehicle, prime minister narendra modi said india’s mars orbiter is a “great achievement” since it costs less than the making of the hollywood blockbuster movie “gravity” which had a tag of $100 million., an inexpensive missionmany have questioned why india should be sending a robotic mission to mars when there is so much poverty, malnutrition, death, disaster and diseases among its 1.2 billon population. some have even called this mission as being a part of india’s “delusional dream” of becoming a superpower in the 21st century. there can be nothing farther from the truth. if one analyses the cost of the mars orbiter mission of rs.450 crore, for indians it works out to be about rs.4 per person. today, a bus ride would cost a lot more., india’s mars orbiter mission has paved the way for cheaper and faster inter-planetary probes. during his upcoming u.s. visit, mr. modi and u.s. president barack obama are likely to sign a new agreement for the making of the joint indo-u.s. radar satellite mission. china and india recently signed an agreement on “peaceful uses of outer space.” so, many are now wanting to partner in isro’s success., the mission, within minutes of reaching mars, has already taken its first images of the martian surface. the mars colour camera, which is essentially an indian eye to track mars, will bring back the first tangible truths to indian taxpayers that their money has been well spent., if the 20th century witnessed a “space race” between the u.s. and the ussr, the 21st century is seeing an asian space race. in most aspects of space technology, china is way ahead of india. it has larger rockets, bigger satellites and several rocket ports. it even launched its first astronaut in space way back in 2003 and has a space laboratory in the making., in 2008, when india undertook its first mission to moon chandrayaan-1, china raced ahead and orbited its chang’e-1 satellite ahead of india. but in this martian marathon, india has reached the finish line ahead of china. this now puts india in the pole position as far as asian martian exploration goes. in 2012, the first chinese probe to mars yinghuo-1 failed. it was riding atop a russian satellite called phobos-grunt. but the chinese probe failed to even leave earth. earlier in 1998, a japanese probe to mars ran out of fuel., today, india’s mars orbiter mission has shown that the indian elephant has lumbered ahead of the chinese red dragon. for the record, isro’s chairman dr. k. radhakrishnan has gone on record by saying, “we are not racing with anybody. we are racing with ourselves. we have to race to reach the next level of excellence.”, challenges aheadnow that india has reached mars, isro has several other goals and challenges to meet. coming up in the next few weeks is the test firing of india’s monster rocket, the geosynchronous satellite launch vehicle mk iii, a rocket capable of carrying heavy payloads into space. this flight will carry a dummy crew module, which is part of a programme for the development of critical technologies that isro seeks to develop as part of its human space flight programme., as isro says, the first astronaut could well be a woman. in a few weeks, an indian navigation satellite will be also launched into space. by 2017, isro wants to undertake india’s second mission to moon chandrayaan-2 which will have an indian lander and a rover. subsequently, it also wants to launch dedicated missions to study the sun and the planetary bodies in the solar system., mr. modi, in his stirring speech to isro, spoke of its capabilities and efficiencies. it is an eye-opener that a country which can undertake a mission to mars is unable to provide electricity to 400 million citizens. what is worse is that 600 million indians still don’t have access to toilets. it is hoped that mr. modi would have learnt a lesson or two from the indian space agency on how to undertake cost-effective projects with no time or cost overruns. if only mr. modi internalises this big learning can his dream of having “swachh bharat” by 2019 become a reality.",0.06676136363636365,"faster , cheaper mars orbiter","making history : martian marathon , india reached finish line ahead china. picture shows rocket carrying mars orbiter lifting

2014-10-11,private cleanliness amid public squalor,"after my sister’s death some years ago, i had carried her ashes for immersion in the kosi river, an insignificant mountain tributary of the ganga. i wanted an unsullied bit of water for a religious ceremony, and so chose a secluded stretch of the river in uttarakhand near ranikhet. but despite the remoteness, the water and its sand bed was littered with plastic, toothpaste tubes and instant noodle packets. and as the ceremony progressed, i noticed upstream from us a group of men defecating and chatting on the river rocks., it is no secret that india has the largest number of people defecating in the open, even when a toilet is available. whether a rivulet along a sloped hillside in a pristine himalayan valley, a river coursing through a city, or indeed along a coastal beach, water is as much an invitation to drink as it is to excrement. even the ganga functions at two levels: as religious sanctuary and india’s largest open air sewer., wherever you go — in city or countryside — plastic bags, tetra paks and tin cans mar the landscape. in slum areas and industrial townships, rivulets of slime snake along mud tenements. in cities, garbage overwhelms all sightlines (i recently saw a group of japanese tourists photographing ragpickers foraging in raw sewage, next to the monument they had come to see). just as the mughals had decorated gateways around their settlements, entrances to indian towns today are rife with a new 21st century sign of welcome: mountains of trash. as humans, pigs and vultures battle among the waste, there hangs over most places, a perpetual stench of decay and death., for prime minister narendra modi’s “clean india” campaign, a rs.2 lakh crore expenditure is envisaged by the government to clean the country by october 2, 2019, a date to be celebrated as the 150th birth anniversary of mahatma gandhi. part of the money is intended for drinking water and sanitation programmes and the rest for the physical clean up of indian cities. but, so acute is the problem of waste, it is hard to believe that the mission can be anything more than a symbolic act., moreover, the indian public has infinite tolerance for hackneyed political gestures — planting saplings, visiting rajghat, laying foundation stones, conducting pujas for newly built flyovers. “swachh bharat” too, say critics, will only remain afloat in the big cities, till such time as the prime minister’s greater interest in business matters relegates it to the dung heap. the project’s farcical dimension can already be seen in the surprise inspections of government offices, and the large quantum of brooms and dustbins ordered by bureaucrats and ministers, some departments going into direct competition with each other by issuing instruction handbooks on cleanliness., that the prime minister of a country needs to intervene on an issue as basic as public health is of course the first serious admission that the problem is way out of hand. on the world stage, india is already acknowledged as one of the dirtiest and least liveable countries in the world. in a recent survey of the liveability index of 150 world cities, delhi, mumbai and other indian metros were all listed below 130, only ahead of some west african cities. (ironically, the same survey listed delhi as the most desirable city among the indian low performers.) chief among the criterion of liveability was health and sanitation, though other related conditions such as infrastructure, parks and accessibility were also spelled out., indian cities took a beating on the most rudimentary aspects of survival, and were classified more as unplanned spontaneous slums than functioning towns, with some of the highest recorded levels of toxic waste, and consequently, physical sickness. incidents of asthma and lung infection linked directly to pollution were steadily on the rise. in most metros it was stated as 12 times the national average, and almost a third of the population suffered some form of respiratory illness; the survey also gave damning figures on waterborne diseases, and reduced eyesight, impaired mental acuity and shorter lifespans., in most countries, public health and sanitation are taken for granted and fall squarely on urban administration. so basic are norms of healthy urban living around the world, they rarely ever make it as news items. only in india do routine municipal issues assume national importance. blocked drains during monsoons, road repair, malarial and dengue outbreaks, raw sewage on sidewalks, children stuck in wells, open manholes, fallen trees and collapsing buildings are all signs of a disintegrating collective life. when municipal authorities fail to oversee ordinary maintenance and are incapable of undertaking decisions on day-to-day governance, the city becomes a nightmare of incompetence and failed ideas, regressing quickly into anarchy — a battleground so scarred that the rich can only isolate themselves into private compounds, creating their own insular lives unrelated to the city; the poor are left to their own devices, living in the ruin and seeking business opportunity in the squalor and clutter. the prime minister’s cleanliness campaign is merely the fallout of complete municipal collapse., while credit is certainly due to mr. modi for initiating the much needed push to make the country a physically healthier place, the larger thrust of the nationwide mission needs to take into account other ideas that indirectly contribute to civic grime. cars physically choke city space, parking on sidewalks, covering up and clogging drainage systems;

2014-10-15,for a swachh bharatiya rail,"unsightly: garbage attracts rodents. picture shows a station in chennai.— photo: r. ragu | photo credit: r_ragu , imagine being bitten by a rat, not once but twice! that is what happened recently to a person travelling in a train to chennai. the passenger, rather than reacting hysterically, calmly squeezed the bite wound, before complaining to the railway authorities and seeking medical aid. the local railway authorities, while expressing regret, told the passenger that the rake (train formation) is maintained at mumbai, implying that the responsibility for the presence of the pesky rodent lay elsewhere., now, why should a rat be found in a train? to be sure, >railways and rats (and bandicoots and mice) have had a long association going back almost to the advent of the railways in india in the mid-nineteenth century. but while in the past, rats and their kindred species were largely confined to goods sheds, parcel offices and occasionally got sucked into train vacuum pipes (now thankfully defunct with the advent of airbrakes), now they have become frequent travellers in reserved and ac coaches. the average passenger is wont to attribute this to the utter negligence, callousness, and inefficiency of a government-run monopoly. however such a conclusion would be simplistic and hasty., ideal environment for rats some of the major train maintenance centres like the one in chennai are located in the midst of thickly populated urban agglomerations. these are not enclosed or restricted spaces but open yards. because of the washing and wet cleaning of the train formations, the inspection pits and surrounding areas are usually damp. discarded food and waste matter including human excrement expelled from train formations coming in for maintenance add to the problem. this makes an ideal environment for rats, cockroaches and the like to breed. pest control measures can at best be in the nature of a holding action. the current antiquated system of open yards is a carry over of a bygone era. unfortunately, this aspect has never received the attention it has deserved., the answer obviously is to have totally sanitised and covered state-of-the-art maintenance centres that can accommodate train formations of 24 or 26 coaches, with strict access control, totally dry inspection pits, and other facilities apart from separate washing bays with waste water reclamation. with the progressive introduction of modern designs of toilets, direct discharge of human waste to the outside can be avoided., this is not some utopian scenario; what is suggested above are exactly the type of facilities that will be set up for the maintenance of the much-hyped bullet trains. there is no reason, therefore, why over the next decade or so similar facilities should not be set up, at least in major urban centres, to service trains used by the aam aadmi. but even with such improved facilities, due to the steady increase in the number of trains each year, stabling of train formations out in the open cannot be totally avoided. this entails keeping the yards also in a reasonable state of cleanliness, free of litter and unwanted vegetation., the indian attitude, ‘it is my privilege to litter, your duty to clean’, has to go , further, with the intensive utilisation of train formations, they are often kept on station platforms for a long time and turned back after “dry” cleaning, with some unintended benefits for the rodent population. for railway stations are the other major centres for the proliferation of rodents and other pests. there are two reasons for this: first, the easy availability of edible garbage and second, the plentiful supply of perishables such as fish on the platforms. indian railways must perhaps be the only major railway system in the world where fare-paying passengers have to jostle for space with huge mounds of parcels scattered on the platforms of all major stations. this tyranny of the parcels is bound to continue unless there is complete segregation of parcels and passenger traffic. studies have been conducted in the past towards this end, but no tangible progress has been achieved., the >swachh bharat abhiyaan, launched by prime minister narendra modi, has rightly emphasised cleanliness as a goal. it is high time, therefore, that attention is directed towards setting right the infrastructural shortcomings that contribute directly to insanitary conditions in railway premises and trains. while the images of ministers and senior officials posing with the broom may provide smart photo-ops, it will take more than the broom to clean up the railways., with more than 12,600 trains carrying 23 million passengers every day, indian railways must be that unique institution in the country that generates the largest volume and variety of garbage (including human waste) rivalling many large towns. to expect this huge volume of trash to be dealt with by an army of cleaning staff with brooms and such implements is to totally misjudge the nature and scale of the problem., comparisons are frequently drawn between the spotless premises and train interiors of railway systems abroad and the woeful condition of trains and stations in india. what is blithely overlooked is the fact that in those countries all public spaces, not only trains and stations, are generally litter-free, not because they employ an army of safaiwallas with brooms but because of the innate civic sense of the citizens. this is not an excuse for railway premises and trains being dirty or being infested with rats, cockroaches and the like. but while there are internal issues such as upgrading of maintenance facilities and segregation of parcel traffic involving heavy investments that the railways themselves have to deal with, an equally important input is the positive contribution that the millions of railway users can make in ensuring a clean, litter-free environment. the attitude “it is my privilege to litter, your duty to clean” has to go.",0.08282748501498502,swachh bharatiya rail,"unsightly : garbage attracts rodents. picture shows station chennai. — photo : r. ragu &#124;

2014-10-18,"make for india, not just in india","ase of business: “government policies that have made foreign investment easy, coupled with tax holidays in sezs, have provided incentives for setting up export-oriented captives.” picture shows a worker at an sez in kochi. photo: h. vibhu | photo credit: h_vibhu , with a large engineering workforce and links with the english language, india already has some natural advantages in providing knowledge workers to global corporations. in addition, government policies that have made foreign investment increasingly easy, coupled with tax holidays in special economic zones that only large corporations can afford to move into, have provided excellent incentives for setting up export-oriented captives in india., in the last 10 years, the number of global research and development (r&d) captives in india has been progressively increasing. a recent study by zinnov consulting found that nearly half of the top 500 global r&d spenders have set up shop in india. these captives and their service providers together have created a globally exposed and competent workforce in india in addition to a new wealthy class of a few white collared professionals. the positive impact that this has made to the country is significant and real, even if it is limited to a small percentage of the population. to replicate this success in manufacturing seems a worthy objective, but with lessons from the past, we can and should aim higher., innovation has two beneficiaries — producers and consumers. for example, creating the light bulb was a profitable venture for thomas alva edison but it also benefitted millions of consumers with the innovation., sharing valuein most cases, the knowledge workers seem to be pursuing problems of their employers in western countries. the output of their work often tends to be irrelevant in india. thus in this increasingly interconnected world, one can effectively create islands of producers and consumers that are far removed from each other. the value created is shared by a few producers in india and a lot of consumers in western countries. the recent ‘make in india’ campaign is trying to extend this trend into manufacturing from services., there is a silver lining to this approach. while the output of what workers create is removed from the needs of their country of residence, the skills and capacity that they develop in the process are transferable. for example, workers from the very same pool, using similar tools and processes, created the first of its kind unique identification project in india. aadhar aims to give a billion unique biometric ids to indian residents and has already achieved half of its target within a few years., however, where government policies in attracting more fdi and in encouraging the indian outsourcing industry have been a success, the track record in encouraging companies to innovate and make in india and for india has been poor. with a dismal rank in the ease of doing business index, there is a systemic advantage that existing businesses enjoy versus the problems that new innovative companies seeking to disrupt them have to face. however, improving the country’s rank on this well-established score doesn’t seem to be an important priority for the indian government. apart from the many sound bites, no concrete action is forthcoming., the track record in encouraging companies to make in india and for india has been poor , the initiative of implementing a uniform goods and services tax will do more to create an integrated domestic market than anything else. equally important is to be able to move goods across state borders without being subjected to harassment., however, an export-oriented manufacturing policy sidesteps this issue since the goods produced will mostly go out. another key issue in india is a broken credit system that makes it difficult for new businesses to raise debt. the ‘make in india’ initiative will even further tilt the balance in favour of large domestic firms that hog all credit and can also tap international markets or foreign firms that have better access to capital in their home country. these are barely two in a long list of reforms that india awaits., software as a servicewe can already see examples that frustrate businesses trying to make for india in the software sector. the recent trend of delivering software as a service has proved to be an ideal solution for a capital-scarce country where consumers and small businesses are happier with a pay-as-you-go system rather than investing upfront for using software tools. however, the one thing that such businesses need — an ability to easily collect recurring payments online — is tedious in india. this makes it is easier for an indian company to serve customers in the u.s. than in india. this is tragic, apart from being strange.",0.11026526664824536,"make india , india","ase business :

2014-11-01,recalibrating india’s foreign policy,"indian border security force (bsf) soldiers patroling near the line of control (loc). | photo credit: mukesh gupta , prime minister narendra modi has now interacted with the leaders of four of the five countries/regions — saarc, china, japan, russia, and u.s. — on the list of foreign policy priorities mentioned in the president’s address to the opening session of parliament. it is, therefore, an appropriate time to take stock of the underlying changes in the directions of india’s foreign policy. in other words, is mr. modi’s foreign policy likely to differ from that of sonia gandhi-manmohan singh?, every country’s foreign policy has elements of continuity and change following a change in government. india’s policy under mr. modi is no different. the changes have not necessarily been explicitly articulated, but are implicit in the government’s actions and view of the world., there are five areas of the emerging change: the centrality given to economic and technological development; the orientation of domestic and foreign policies toward this objective; the emphasis on national power including military power; and stress on soft power; and a reduction in self-imposed constraints on actions that other countries may construe as inimical to their interests., changes in foreign policy the first change in foreign policy relates to the greater attention provided to economic objectives. this is not a mere reiteration of the economic development objective that has been india’s mantra since independence but recognition of the role of technology (broadly defined) in all aspects of economic development. this involves an implicit benchmarking of the technological capabilities of the indian economy with the global best practices; having a perception of the gaps; and setting the goal of bridging these gaps., the government’s divergence from the policies of the previous regimes is reflected in two initiatives, the swachh bharat abhiyan and the digital india campaign, both of which involve the use of appropriate technology., “aggression along the border is being countered by bold moves like the decision to construct a ‘mcmahon highway’ in arunachal pradesh”, this is probably the first time that an indian prime minister has explained india’s economic and technological objectives abroad — ‘india first’; has identified the specific role each country could play in achieving these objectives — for instance u.s. and japan; and has made that the centrepiece of his discussion with the leaders of that country. ‘india first’ means that india’s requirements — when it comes to various areas like basic sanitation, defence and space technology — will be expressed with greater clarity and specificity to other countries., the second change relates to a much greater orientation of domestic and foreign policies toward those objectives. the indian prime minister has been very explicit about indian objectives with respect to economic development and technological catch-up and in exploring how domestic and international policies will be used to close the gaps across the entire spectrum. its decisions will then be based on a cost-benefit analysis on a defined set of parameters, not on ideological considerations like that of non-alignment., the third change is with respect to a greater emphasis on overall national power — recognising that economic power is its foundation, but also giving a greater role to military power., the modi government appreciates that economic power cannot be a substitute for military power in deterring aggression from the ideologically driven foes. on the contrary, economic assistance can be viewed by military ideologues as an expression of superiority to be resented. economic relations can complement international security relationships by influencing the behaviour of non-ideological, economically rational players in the global system but only military strength can deter militaristic ideologues and ensure peace., operationally, this has two important implications. one is a clearer appreciation of all the dimensions of external threat, particularly unconventional threats. this requires a build-up of world-class equipment and skills over a much wider spectrum of warfare and covert capabilities and a willingness to boldly attack the aggressor in his safe havens. this is already happening both in terms of enhancing capabilities in counter-terrorism and in defence against non-state actors; and, more importantly, in doctrines incorporating a willingness to take calculated risks in using asymmetric capabilities., on deterrence deterrence is however only effective if the adversary is convinced that the new government will respond to asymmetric warfare with appropriate action spread across a much broader spectrum of conventional and unconventional options. when diplomatic moves sent to our western neighbour, like the track-2 dialogue, did not have any impact on ‘deep state’, it became necessary to bring about a change in the overall strategy through a heightened conventional response to border firing/ceasefire violations., similarly, unconventional psychological warfare and ‘creeping annexation’ tactics along the northern border are being countered by bolder plans — like the decision to construct a ‘mcmahon highway’ along lac in arunachal — that have both conventional and symbolic components., the second implication is a much greater focus on national capability to produce a broad range of defence equipment in india. ‘self-sufficiency’ has been a slogan from the days of nehruvian socialism, but it played second fiddle to the ideological goal of preserving public sector’s monopoly over the means of (defence) production. this is being decisively broken., the ability and willingness to transfer technology and help build skills and research capabilities at lower costs will consequently play a much more important role in our relations with japan, russia, u.s. and eu countries. this reinvigorated approach to national security is likely to manifest itself in a reversal of the trend of decline in ratio of defence expenditures to gdp., the fourth change is a greater emphasis on ‘soft power’. mr. modi’s speech to the indian diaspora in new york was a successful attempt to inspire them to contribute to the country’s economic and technological development., the fifth change is a freeing up of self-imposed, historical and mental constraints on developing the relationship with any country to its full potential. thus, india’s economic relationship with potential adversaries can be independent of its security relationship. this is reflected in developments like the economic agreements reached between mr. modi and chinese president xi jingping, the formation of the brics bank and aiib (asian infrastructure investment bank). further, the relationship with one country will not constrain that with others — cooperation with china will not affect that with japan. both will be evaluated in terms of india’s objectives of building national power., pragmatic reset of policy mr. modi’s pragmatic reset of policy toward the u.s. reflects this change in overall approach. the u.s. is still the sole superpower and stands head and shoulders above others in the depth and breadth of its strategic and defence technology. it is also a major source of technology, capital and export markets for the indian private sector., there are, however, inherent differences in perspective between a rich global power and a poor regional one: u.s. is a net exporter of technology with high per-capita pollution while india is a net technology importer with high incremental pollution., a pragmatic approach seems to be emerging to resolving these differences and to minimise the negative fallout of unresolved differences and focus on areas of convergence like counter-terrorism and maritime security in and around the indian ocean.",0.10667940392940392,recalibrating india ’ foreign policy,"indian border security force ( bsf ) soldiers patroling near line control ( loc ) . &#124;

2014-11-01,look back at kamal,"""films just don’t feel like work any more. they remind me of the time i used to build pyramids with playing cards when i was a child."" photo: s. r. raghunathan , sixty. does it seem like a milestone that forces you to look back at the journey you’ve taken?, well, it’s definitely no surprise that i am turning 60. the fact that i’ve lived this long is not really an achievement. time passes, we age… it’s natural. this is why it annoys me when a person watches a movie and tells me that it was ‘time pass’. would time not have passed if he hadn’t watched the film? but yes, i do throw glances at what i’ve done; i take stock of my inventory, so to speak. i think i’ve managed to retain my honesty, and while i don’t agree that it’s a great policy as the adage goes, i believe that it’s a luxury that only few people can afford., on your birthday, you’re encouraging your fan club to clean a lake in taramani., there are civic issues that bother me. my road (eldam’s road), for example, has been laid and relaid over and over again. as a boy who looked out of the window at this road, i can, with confidence, tell you that the road has ascended several feet. why is the road not scraped before a new one is laid? i’m talking about these issues, as swachh bharat seems to be quite the trend now., some people believe that for change to occur, the people who seek it must participate in governance. with your fan base, politics must seem an interesting prospect., would i get into politics? i’ll just say what i tell people when they ask me this. pray that everyday citizens like me aren’t pushed to that corner. i’m happy doing my bit in the background with my supporters. we have been doing useful work for 30 years., in fact, one of the most memorable photographs of my life was one in which a member of my ‘narpani iyakkam’ stood waist-deep in a sink hole to clean drainage. he did that, expecting nothing in return., is it scary that there are admirers who’re willing to do anything?, yes. that’s why i changed the fan club to a ‘narpani iyakkam’. in fact, when the late mgr asked me if i was interested in politics, i asked him instead for suggestions on how to make my group apolitical., you wrote both vishwaroopam 2 and uttama villain. in an interview, you have said you’re grateful that filmmakers like r. c. sakthi encouraged you to write., yes! i wish i could be equally encouraging of shruti (shruti haasan). i think she writes a lot better than i do. perhaps she will read this interview and get motivated to write more., what else do you write?, i write the occasional poem. i think my dabbling in poetry makes me better at screenplays. poetry teaches the value of condensing, the importance of talking in a few words. so, yes, i do write poetry even though i’m asked not to publish them., too controversial?, i wrote one ten years back about the onset of gay marriages. so, you can imagine., despite your confessed reluctance to act, you chose to do so., people keep saying balachander discovered me. i differ. he invented me. when a stalwart like him suggests that i act in films, who am i to refuse?, what do you make of the kind of films you’re working on today?, well, it’s clear that i’m scared and i’m playing the market. i’m not as free as an art filmmaker and that’s fine because i want to take people towards that destination eventually. the journey is more important, and when i die, i want to do so knowing that i’ve led some people forward. that said, i’d really like to make a film like terrence malick’s the tree of life. before all that, let me make the usual films without the fear of them being banned., from virumaandi to vishwaroopam, your films have met with quite some backlash, haven’t they?, being offended is one thing, breaking glass is another. if somebody misrepresented a reality i relate to, i’d probably be offended by it, but i wouldn’t resort to violence or fundamentalist measures., going back to writing, i see that many directors prefer to do the writing themselves. why’s this?, i had a conversation with karunanidhi once, when he asked me why i was keeping him waiting for so long before each release. i told him, “ezhudha therinjavanga illa sir.” he replied, “therinju ezhudharavan illanu sollunga.” i don’t think we have enough trained screenwriters here., surely, there are tamil novelists who can step in?, i was responsible for bringing in people like the late sujatha into the industry. however, most writers are sceptical of film people, i think. it’s just a different medium., a progressive film like aval appadithan was made in 1978. do you believe we have grown since then?, we have regressed really. i’m not sure what is causing this decline. it’s perhaps the mass influx of untrained people into the industry because of the success of filmmakers like bharathiraja and ilaiyaraaja. aval appadithan was a guerilla attack on the industry by insiders like me. it slipped through their fingers, so to speak. with all the attention that films get these days, i doubt we can get away with such a film any more., people think bharathiraja and ilaiyaraaja just came from their villages and became legends here. they don’t know the training and hard work they had to put in to get where they are today. when we were making raja paarvai, ilaiyaraaja would often request to be excused in the evening. i initially thought he probably wanted some sleep. later, i came to know that he was taking classes in classical music in the evenings. it is such dedication to learning that gets you to the top., so, you believe that the regression is caused mainly by untrained filmmakers?, sure. when i met the late director balu mahendra, i was encouraged by his education at the pune film institute. i asked him if i should join too, and he said i should. however, i learned then that high school dropouts like myself would not be allowed to train there. but at least, during the days that i stepped into films, we had the excuse of not having any training centres in filmmaking. today, there’s just no excuse., for perhaps the first time in decades, you have three films waiting for release., it’s a strange phenomenon. i was worried about the fate of vishwaroopam 2 after what happened to its predecessor. so, instead of waiting for its release, i moved on to uttama villain after lingusamy and i spoke. i also agreed to do papanasam, as it seemed like an interesting film., shooting for these films is over. in fact, shooting for vishwaroopam 2 was over last october except for one song. production delays have kept it waiting. clearly, you can do as many pujas as you want when launching a film, but its fate ultimately isn’t decided by supernatural entities., you are an atheist, are you not? it’s interesting that you ended dasavatharam with ‘kadavul irundha nalla irukkum’ (it’d be a good thing if god existed)?, let me just say i can exist without god; i cannot exist without people. the line was a compromise in a way. i believe that the true saints are those working in places like cern. a person like peter higgs should probably be canonised by the vatican. those are the saints i worship.",0.16762274645186032,look back kamal,""" films ’ feel like work more. remind time used build pyramids playing cards child.

2014-11-01,when the girls came marching in,"on teachers’ day (september 5), the prime minister of india decided to be the ‘teacher of teachers’ and addressed students across the country. on gandhi jayanti (october 2), he repackaged the legacy of and invoked ‘the father of the nation’. netas and babus across the country suddenly became conscious of the need for swachhata (hygiene) and started sweeping streets; with each stroke of the broom choreographed for cameras and reporters. school children were brought out in rallies, parroting slogans they hardly comprehended. , so when on october 2, the residents and shopkeepers in bhim, rajasthan, heard schoolgirls shouting slogans, they paid little attention. they thought it was another swachhata rally. but, as the words became clearer and the rally was sighted, people were drawn out of their homes and shops by the palpable difference: this was a real protest march., about 500 girls, in neat uniforms, marched down the street, holding a banner and placards, enthusiastically shouting slogans. they were not instigated by any political leader or group, and their demand was simple and straightforward: to appoint teachers in their school as per government norms. by the time they went through the town, they had gained people’s sympathy and support; an unusual and important form of civil disobedience had begun., raajakiya balika ucha madhyamik vidhyalay (government girls’ higher secondary school, bhim) is located in the heart of bhim, a small dusty town in rajsamand district, rajasthan. about 700 girls, from std. ix to xii study there, but the number of teaching staff is just three. the principal’s post has been vacant for eight years and one teacher is the acting principal. there is no teacher for basic subjects like mathematics, science, history, geography, hindi and sanskrit. the 11 first grade teacher posts have been vacant since the school was upgraded around 10 years ago. repeated petitions to authorities have gone unanswered though the school is just a stone’s throw away from the block development office (bdo)., since the children of most public officials study in private schools, the government schools’ poor condition and the future of their students does not affect the officials personally. many of the government school students come from very poor families. they travel around 15-20 km to school and spend around rs.20 on daily transport., feeling frustrated and helpless, on the eve of gandhi jayanti, a few students sought the help of shankar singh, a senior activist of the mazdoor kisan shakti sangathan (mkss) in bhim. he tried to persuade them to get their parents to petition the government authorities and begin a dialogue. but the students knew that since most of their parents were daily wage workers, they would not be able to leave their work and begin a dialogue with a set of intimidating officials — the results of which they were sceptical about in any case. so, the students successfully convinced shankar singh and the mkss to provide guidance and moral support., they planned to organise a peaceful rally the next day and submit a memorandum to the block development officer demanding immediate action to appoint teachers. , on october 2, around 450 girls locked the school gate and put up a banner — ‘700 students, 3 teachers; fill up the vacancies now’ — across it. a memorandum was prepared and signatures of all the students obtained. before beginning the rally, the students gathered at the school gate and raised slogans: ‘shiksha hamara adhikar, adhyapak do sarkar’ (education is our right! oh government appoint the teachers for us), ‘padhne wale 700 hain, padhanewale 3 hain” (we are 700 but only three to teach us), and ‘shiksha ka adhikar diya padhane wale koi nahin’ (you gave us the right to education but no one to teach us)., the slogans were innovative and striking, the girls disciplined and determined. the authorities tried to dissuade them. the police told them that they would ruin their padhai (education). the girls retorted, “what padhai is there to be ruined?, the rally route was chosen to reach out to the residents. the students marched on the busy market streets shouting slogans as they went along ‘hindi wala koi nahi, itihas wala koi nahi, ganith wala koi nahi’ (no one to teach hindi/history/maths…). they did not obstruct traffic as they marched in two lines holding the banner in the front. after covering the market, they entered the national highway (nh 8, delhi–mumbai). once the police saw the rally’s peaceful nature, they did not try to stop it but concentrated on managing the traffic., the rally reached the block development officer’s office around 11.30 a.m. the bdo was not there, and the tehsildar and other functionaries came out of their office. they were surprised by the girls’ numbers, confidence and discipline. the students sat on dharna on the road in front of the office, braving the blistering sun. three girls spoke on behalf of the others and explicitly and fearlessly articulated their problems in the presence of government officials, their three teachers, the media, and the general public. they demanded the government respond immediately by appointing teachers; at least one each for every main subject. asserting that they would not be content with ‘empty promises’, they insisted on a time frame. a large and increasingly sympathetic crowd had gathered outside the block office. the government could not afford to ignore them anymore., officials spoke to the students, trying to soothe their nerves. the tehsildar said that he sincerely empathised with them and would do everything possible to find an immediate solution. but the students interrupted by asking him to announce the dates by which teachers would be appointed. meanwhile, the officer ‘in charge of education’, spoke to the district collector and promised that a geography teacher would be appointed immediately. his excuse of an acute shortage of qualified teaching staff in the state was met with an angry outburst: “there are enough teaching staff at every boys’ school, but the government is ignoring our voice since we are girls.” realising that the girls would not relent, the officer promised that mathematics and hindi teachers would be appointed within a week. the students made it clear that if teachers were not appointed by october 7, they would again lock the school gate, and flock to the bdo’s office. , by october 7, no teachers were appointed. on october 8, the girls locked the school gate and sat outside in the sun refusing to accept assurances and open the gates. when accused of disrupting classes, they set up a tent to hold special classes every day outside the school, in full sight of all the offices. at lunch time, some shopkeepers brought them biscuits and snacks, and the pressure on the administration and the education department grew. messages were sent to the collector, the state government, and even the chief minister’s office., as school hours drew to a close, the girls told the bdo that they would conduct classes outside the gate until the promised teachers were appointed. the administration informed them that the orders had been issued and that before the girls came the next morning, four new teachers would report to school. the next morning, the girls saw seven teachers in their assembly.",0.07216565456148788,girls came marching,"teachers ’ day ( september 5 ) , prime minister india decided ‘teacher teachers ’ addressed students across country. gandhi jayanti ( october 2 ) , repackaged legacy invoked ‘the father nation ’ . netas babus across country suddenly became conscious need swachhata ( hygiene ) started sweeping streets ;

2015-02-19,evidence matters to policymaking,"reality check: “evidence shows that just opening bank accounts in someone’s name, as the jan dhan programme is doing, doesn’t work towards achieving the goal of financial inclusion.” prime minister narendra modi at the launch of pradhan mantri jan dhan yojana in new delhi. | photo credit: pti , governments in india have always launched big-ticket social development programmes with ambitious goals. the narendra modi government is no exception. >swachh bharat abhiyan aims to make india open defecation-free by 2019. the pradhan mantri jan dhan yojana’s financial inclusion programme set a target of opening 10 crore bank accounts by january 26, 2015. but are ambitious targets enough for achieving desired outcomes on the ground?, most governments across the world run social development programmes that focus on increasing supply. so, the emphasis is on building toilets, creating bank accounts, providing loans and so on. for politicians, development needs to be visible for it to count as an achievement. it is harder to assess if these programmes are really achieving the results that matter and whether they are improving the lives of the poor. the focus on supply, while ignoring demand, is an approach that has often failed. for example, will toilets be used if they are built? the ministry of drinking water and sanitation is now asking people to post pictures of unused toilets on its website. low usage of toilets is clearly an issue. are the toilets that are being built improving sanitation and child health by reducing diarrhoea — a highly preventable condition that is the leading cause of death of children under five? the answers to these questions are not forthcoming. nor can they be without rigorous evaluations., need for evaluations flagship development programmes in india have not been designed or modified based on evidence from evaluations. there has been a continuity of some social programmes over decades, although governments may have given them different names and made a few changes in design. >swachh bharat abhiyan builds on nirmal bharat abhiyan (2012), the total sanitation campaign (1999) and the central rural sanitation programme (1986). but politics rather than evidence is the key driver for programmes getting closed, changed or renamed., synthesised evidence from impact evaluations of water and sanitation programmes in low and middle-income countries shows that building toilets is not enough for improving sanitation. an impact evaluation of the total sanitation campaign in odisha in 2010 showed that demand-oriented programmes raised latrine use from just six per cent to 35 per cent. this seems like a useful increase, but not one that made any difference to people’s health, and left 65 per cent still not using the new facility. a more recent 3ie-supported impact evaluation in odisha also showed a substantial increase in latrine coverage at the village level. but this increase was also insufficient to reduce child diarrhoea, most likely because the villages in the study were not open defecation-free. it is well established that open defecation supports various transmission channels by which children consume faecal matter: direct contact or indirectly from pets or other animals, and through flies crawling on both excrement and the food children may eat. according to the world health organization and unicef, diarrhoea causes the deaths of more than 7,50,000 children under the age of five every year. a study published in the lancet in 2012 reports that in india alone, an average of 2, 12,000 children under the age of five die of diarrhoea every year., global evaluation evidence on sanitation interventions highlights the need to emphasise behavioural factors for promoting the use and sustained adoption of water, sanitation and hygiene technologies. making people pay even a very small fee has put them off from using water treatment technologies. changing behaviour can take years and decades. sanitation programmes in india need to take this evidence into account., evidence in financial inclusion in the same vein, financial inclusion programmes also need to consider evaluation evidence. according to a 2014 report brought out jointly by the world bank, the better than cash alliance and the bill & melinda gates foundation, over 2.5 billion adults around the world are ‘unbanked’. evidence shows that just opening bank accounts in someone’s name, as the jan dhan programme is doing, doesn’t work. many people don’t even access the account to take out the initial deposit placed there for them. jan dhan’s goal of opening accounts for 10 crore poor people is not enough by itself. there are many reasons people don’t use bank accounts: lack of trust in financial institutions, distance to the bank, illiteracy and reliance on informal and traditional banking sources. in addition to tackling these issues, there may be a need for complementary activities to ensure that the poor can benefit from having bank accounts., “plenty of inspiration can be found for evidence-based policymaking from latin american countries such as mexico, which is known for its system of evaluating social programmes”, the challenge for the modi government now is to evaluate what works in development programming before making large spending decisions. this would mean putting in place rigorous evaluations of the new programmes it is launching. existing programmes need to also be evaluated before major decisions are made about their future. building a culture of evidence-informed policymaking would also require moving towards institutionalising evaluation within government., randomised controlled trials there is plenty of inspiration that can be found for this from other countries, particularly those in latin america. mexico is widely known in the international development community for its system of evaluating social programmes. in the mid-90s, the mexican government launched progresa, one of the world’s first conditional cash transfer programmes. progresa handed out cash to poor families on the condition that they send their children to school and young mothers seek antenatal care. giving cash directly to the poor was not the only innovative aspect of progresa. the government put in place a rigorous randomised evaluation of the programme. just as clinical trials have informed evidence-based medicine, randomised controlled trials of social programmes provide rigorous evidence of whether programmes are working or not.",0.03621850371850372,evidence matters policymaking,"reality check : “evidence shows opening bank accounts someone ’ name , jan dhan programme , ’ work towards achieving

session in new delhi on monday. , address by the president of india, shri pranab mukherjee to the joint session of both houses of parliament, new delhi : 23.02.2015, honourable members,, 1. in this new year full of aspirations and hope, i welcome you to the joint sitting of the two houses of the parliament with the belief that your deliberations will be productive and useful., 2. dr. shyama prasad mukherjee had said, ""the greatest strength of india is her rich spiritual and civilizational heritage”.the core values of our civilization emphasize universal good - welfare of all human beings. the fundamental tenet of my government is sabka saath sabka vikas – all together, development of all. within a span of nine months, my government has articulated and embarked on a comprehensive strategy for unleashing the full potential of our country and its precious resource of 125 crore people. measures have been initiated to stir action in a range of fields from sanitation to smart cities, poverty elimination to creation of wealth, skill development to conquering space, tapping demographic dividend to diplomatic initiatives, enhancing ease of doing business to putting in place a stable policy framework, empowering individuals to ensuring quality infrastructure, ending financial untouchability to making the country a manufacturing hub, containing inflation to stimulating economy, igniting minds to ensuring inclusive growth, promoting cooperative federalism to encouraging a competitive spirit among the states. a strong beginning has been made. a promising future awaits us., honourable members,, 3. poverty is a bane to dignified human existence. development is actualized only when the last person gets a sense of fulfillment, especially, regarding his minimum needs. pandit deendayal upadhyaya had laid emphasis on holistic development of each and every human being - ekatm manavata darshan (integral humanism).my government is pledged to work for the welfare of the poor, the marginalized and the vulnerable sections of the society., 4. financial inclusion is critical to poverty elimination. my government launched an ambitious pradhan mantri jan dhan yojanato provide universal access to banking facilities – a bank account, having in-built accidental insurance with a rupay debit card. i am happy to state that the coverage under the scheme is close to 100% with a record 13.2 crore new bank accounts being opened, 11.5 crore rupay debit cards being issued and over ` 11,000 crore being deposited. this unprecedented target was achieved in less than six months, making it the largest such programme globally., 5. to ensure that the benefits of developmental programmes reach the last intended beneficiary without leakages and impediments, direct benefit transfer programme is being implemented with renewed vigour. the biggest direct cash transfer programme in the world, pahal, for transfer of lpg subsidy, has been extended across the country from 1stjanuary, 2015, so far covering 75% of the user-households. in all, 35 schemes have been brought under direct benefit transfer architecture. special emphasis is attached to make aadhar enrolment coverage universal., honourable members,, 6. swachhata is an article of faith for my government. swachhata will have an overarching impact on the overall quality of life and well-being of a person, particularly the poor. swachh bharat mission has been launched to achieve a clean and open defecation free india by october, 2019. government has rolled out ‘swachh vidyalaya’ programme and is committed to construct a toilet in every school before 15th august, 2015.swachhata has a cascading impact on national development and the potential to generate wealth from waste. sanitation and the idea of swachhata require changing the mindset of the people. my government exhorts each and every individual to be an active participant in this mission. i appeal to all honourable members of parliament to spend at least fifty percent of their mplads funds on swachh bharat mission., 7. india lives in her villages. my government attaches the highest priority to sustainable socio-economic growth of rural areas. mgnregs can be a powerful weapon to combat rural poverty. while implementing mgnregs with renewed vigour, emphasis is being placed on improving quality and durability of assets under the programme, besides mandating that at least sixty percent of expenditure be directed for creation of agricultural infrastructure. in keeping with my government’s focus on “skill india”, “deen dayal upadhyaya grameen kaushal yojana” and “deen dayal upadhyaya antyodaya yojana” have been announced. saansad adarsh gram yojana launched in october 2014, focuses on integrated and holistic development of our villages with active involvement of members of parliament., 8. housing is a fundamental requirement for dignified living. my government is steadfast in fulfilling the aspirations of all households, particularly the poorest of the poor, to have a dwelling unit under the mission “housing for all” by 2022, marking 75 years of our independence. a set of fiscal and non-fiscal incentives have been devised to leverage the value of land holding with government and to afford flexibility to state governments in designing their own customized housing programmes. to aid investment in housing sector, my government has liberalized fdi policy; increased tax incentives for housing loans and enhanced the corpus of national housing bank., 9. my government attaches paramount importance to safeguard the interest of farmers and families affected by land acquisition. while taking utmost care to protect the interest of farmers, including their compensation entitlements, the right to fair compensation and transparency in land acquisition, rehabilitation and resettlement act has been suitably refined to minimize certain procedural difficulties in acquisition of land inevitably required for critical public projects of infrastructure and for creation of basic amenities like rural housing, schools and hospitals, particularly in remote areas., honourable members,, 10. kisanis the sentinel of our food security. annadaata sukhibhava has been one of our fundamental civilizational values. my government attaches enormous importance to the wellbeing of farmers. this will need value-added agriculture, market reform, use of technology and improving productivity in areas with untapped potential. the year 2015 has been designated as international year of soils. in view of the critical role of soil for productivity and farm output, a soil health card scheme has been launched. price stabilization fund with a corpus of ` 500 crore has been set up for perishable commodities. to address the irrigation requirements of every village in an effective and sustainable manner, pradhan mantri krishi sinchai yojana, is being launched. extension programmes have been devised targeting resource-poor, small and marginal farmers, particularly focusing on organic farming and green house technology. rashtriya gokul mission has been launched with the objective of conserving and developing indigenous cattle breeds., 11. food processing has immense potential for generating employment in rural areas, particularly for the landless poor, besides guaranteeing remunerative price for the farm-produce. creating infrastructure in rural areas to minimize supply chain losses is a priority. a special fund of ` 2000 crore to provide affordable credit to the units in 72 notified food parks has been made operational. two mega food parks, at tumkur and fazilka, each to provide direct/indirect employment to 30,000 people have been commissioned in the last 6 months., 12. former prime minister shri atal bihari vajpayee had said and i quote: ""poverty has multiple effects. besides impacting our economy, it corrodes our democracy”. inclusive growth covering the poorest of poor from the most vulnerable and disadvantaged sections of our society is my government’s topmost priority. thrust has been given to streamlining scholarships schemes for students from sc, st, obc, and minority communities to ensure timely disbursement to the beneficiaries. government has set up a new venture capital fund for sc entrepreneurs. to upgrade skill and training in traditional arts/crafts of minorities, a new scheme “upgrading the skill and training in traditional arts/crafts for development (usttad)” is being launched. outcome based integrated approach has been adopted for tribal development under thevan bandhu kalyan yojana. nanaji deshmukh scheme is being launched for construction of hostels for denotified, nomadic and semi-nomadic tribes., honourable members,, 13. education is the priority of priorities for my government. ‘padhe bharat badhe bharat’ has been launched to improve foundational learning outcomes. an initiative to map the entire country on a gis platform to identify habitations without schools, has been taken. pandit madan mohan malviya national mission on teachers and teacher training has been launched to empower and increase the capacity of teachers. therashtriya avishkar abhiyanhas been announced to imbibe scientific temper among students. to ensure access to education in the remotest areas, ishan vikasandishan uday schemes have been started with focus on students of north-eastern regions. my government has formulatednational sports talent search schemefor encouraging sporting talent amongst children in the age group of 8 to 12 through national sports development fund and target olympic podium., 14. india has the largest population of youth in the world. majority of her population is already in the working age group. to tap this demographic dividend and to bridge the demand-supply gap in skilled workforce, my government has created a new ministry of skill development

promoting manufacturing of electronic goods has been an area of thrust., 24. my government is pledged to decentralization of power and as an important step in this direction, the planning commission has been replaced with a new body-the national institution for transforming india -niti aayog. the underlying spirit of niti aayog is to foster the spirit of cooperative federalism so that union and state governments come on a platform to forge a common national agenda for development, with thrust on empowering the impoverished., honourable members,, 25. as a result of my government’s sustained efforts and series of policy initiatives, our economy is again on the high growth trajectory. according to the latest estimates, our gdp is growing at 7.4%, which makes india the fastest growing large

all households, particularly the poorest of the poor, to have a dwelling unit under the mission “housing for all” by 2022, marking 75 years of our independence. a set of fiscal and non-fiscal incentives have been devised to leverage the value of land holding with government and to afford flexibility to state governments in designing their own customized housing programmes. to aid investment in housing sector, my government has liberalized fdi policy; increased tax incentives for housing loans and enhanced the corpus of national housing bank., 9. my government attaches

2015-04-13,an indianness that needs no aadhar,"shiv visvanathan , sometimes when you get up in the morning and reach for the newspaper wondering what the world has in store, you occasionally savour a moment which is more heart-warming than having a cup of coffee. i just read a report about maryam asif siddiqui, a 12-year-old school student in mumbai, having stood first in the “gita champions league” contest, where the participants were tested on their knowledge and understanding of the bhagavad gita. it was not the fact that she is a muslim but her reverence for all religions and the wisdom of religions that warmed one’s heart., such news is a perfect counter to the vitriol of giriraj singh, a union minister, who was in the limelight recently for his controversial and racist remarks on congress president sonia gandhi. the contrast between singh and siddiqui is deep. one celebrates difference while the other seeks to subjugate it. one throbs with intelligence while the other breathes mediocrity., today, christians are being targeted but if anyone is stereotyping hinduism, it is the rashtriya swayamsevak sangh (rss) and the bharatiya janata party (bjp). their hindutva is a sign of envy, of a mediocrity that wants to imitate the west., a sense of siegepeople like mr. singh create and leave behind a trail of anxiety where the minorities feel pressure on themselves to realise their identity. this became especially poignant in two instances; the first, in an essay/article by former police officer and diplomat julio ribeiro, and the second, in an interview of indian political psychologist, social theorist, and critic ashis nandy. both are christians but what is interesting is that both are true indians, not in a nationalist sense, but as a part of the culture. ribeiro is proud of being a christian and indian and his career as an officer. it is his christianity that has made him a part of india and made him aware that christianity in india is older than it is in the west. but now he claims, “communities were being targeted, a sense of siege affects a peaceful people”., both ribeiro and nandy express the confidence of a community which does not see itself as a minority. it feels it is a part of india’s pluralistic culture, where identities are many, and affiliations open-ended. ribeiro wonders what his indianness means when his christianity is being threatened. earlier, being christian and indian was never contradictory to each other., challenge to democracywhile the bjp may have shattered ribeiro’s confidence, it still has not dented ashis nandy’s. he sees it as representing the lowest common denominator of democracy. nandy is proud of kolkata and he knows that his city will never harass christians. he sees it in the logic of its culture and his pride is not so much in his ‘christian identity’ but in his syncretic calcuttan past which celebrates the multiverse called the city., “ being all and yet being one is what makes me indian. no bajrang dal or vhp can deprive me of this confidence.”, nandy has an additional advantage. while ribeiro sees society within the categories of law and order, nandy’s sensibilities tell him that most indians believe in a panoply of disorderly things. hindus attend church services, muslims are custodians of temples and our culture oozes with this syncretism. from saadat hasan manto’s bombay talkies to the bollywood of the 21st century, a church was part of the everydayness of an indian., watching ribeiro, nandy and maryam, one realises that majoritarianism is a challenge to democracy. the codes of the two systems are different. in one, citizenship is legal, culture is syncretic and politics democratic., for example, as a person, one celebrated the greatness of one’s neighbourhood of identities. as a hindu, i loved christian festivals and enjoyed sikh langars. my pluralism made me more hindu. yet, by contrast, the bjp’s hindutva now makes our culture uniform, politics, majoritarian and citizenship, a matter of loyalties. citizenship in hindutva’s vision is reduced to a conditional status. the former celebrates the politics of difference, the other can think only in impoverished absolutes., listening to these debates, i realise that the bjp government suffers from a failure of imagination at several levels. first it speaks like corporate companies. it speaks a language where one hears more about the adanis and the ambanis and little about rural issues ., second, it shows a preference for the indian abroad than the resident indian because the latter is capable of reworking identities while the diaspora has limited choices. third, in the inclusive vision, culture is all about the availability of alternatives, while for hindutva , it is about a space that needs to be policed. deep down, the bjp has only one monolithic and monotheistic god, the nation state ., the glue that binds usribeiro makes this point subtly; that hinduism is a belief, while hindutva is an ideology. belief, especially religious beliefs, are protean, while ideology is procrustean (enforcing uniformity). religion can be syncretic while ideology is restrictive. this difference, he realises, is vital as ordinary hindus celebrate his presence. they see him as a first-rate officer and honour him., for nandy, hinduism is manifold, while the rss preaches about one nation, one state, one culture, one religion. it is a formula for encouraging mediocrity. nandy is equally clear that christianity does not need conversion., this logic becomes clearer in a story recounted by writer and intellectual u.r. ananthamurthy, another icon who mr. giriraj singh hated. ur recounts the story of an arab intellectual being perplexed by noting that his community has one language, one religion but 22 states, while india has dozens of languages, myriad religions but is still united as a single nation. it is our similarities, and not our differences, that have glued us together., there is a difference in what i call the politics of anxiety and identity. ribeiro and nandy are confident of their selves. giriraj singh on the other hand uses identity to complain about history. mr singh, in trying to explain his comment on the congress president, reveals that he has no self-confidence. nandy and ribeiro are happy to be in india while singh is unhappy with ‘his india’. even his majoritarian confidence is in fact a colonial one which does not know how to deal with someone who is of foreign origin., in fact, what is ironic is the critique of ribeiro’s fears by jagdish bhagwati, professor at columbia university in an article recently. bhagwati begins with a list of the people who are close to christianity in his family. yet, when faced with majoritarian violence and policing, there is little to choose between bhagwati and the illiberal mr. singh. both seem to wish away the violence of the time by creating apologies for the government. in fact, the question one must ask is what is it that prime minister narendra modi adds to indians abroad that a large part of the diaspora treats him as the equivalent of a cultural testosterone shot? it is as if the nationalist bluster of mr. modi compensates for their sense of inferiority and their embarrassment about india’s deficiencies., self-confident culturesdespite their reading of the situation, nandy and ribeiro make a fascinating pair. what they find intriguing is the fact that the majority behaves like a minority even now. in fact, one must comment on union transport minister nitin gadkari’s interesting response when he said he felt “very sad” after reading ribeiro’s article about his growing insecurity as a christian in india. gadkari assures ribeiro that he is an icon and a role model for the country. he is also virtually telling ribeiro that he has passed the loyalty test, adding that it is the opposition that is creating such misperceptions.",0.0868573153899241,indianness needs aadhar,"shiv visvanathan , sometimes get morning reach newspaper wondering world store , occasionally savour moment heart-warming cup coffee. read report maryam asif siddiqui , 12-year-old school student mumbai , stood first “gita champions league ” contest , participants tested knowledge understanding bhagavad gita. fact muslim reverence religions wisdom religions warmed one ’ heart. , news perfect counter vitriol giriraj singh , union minister , limelight recently controversial racist remarks congress president sonia gandhi. contrast singh siddiqui deep. one celebrates difference seeks subjugate it. one throbs intelligence breathes mediocrity. , today , christians targeted anyone stereotyping hinduism , rashtriya swayamsevak sangh ( rss ) bharatiya janata party ( bjp ) . hindutva sign envy , mediocrity wants imitate west. , sense siegepeople like mr. singh create leave behind trail anxiety minorities feel pressure realise identity. became especially poignant two instances ;

2015-05-17,it’s not so green within the ghmc limits,"having lost its sheen as a clean and green city, the city is now gearing up for the massive swachh hyderabad initiative with grand plans aimed at improving sanitation and amenities., however, those at the helm of affairs in the greater hyderabad municipal corporation (ghmc) point out that the civic body, which is primarily responsible for keeping the city clean, has not been able to effectively cope with the increasing demand for sanitation in the widening city limits., neither was the required manpower added nor was the fleet of vehicles equipped to handle the sanitation needs of the city, which ended up denting its clean image., an estimated 4,000 metric tonne of garbage and waste gets generated daily in the ghmc jurisdiction. “it is estimated about eight per cent of this is taken away by rag pickers and others which leaves the rest to the civic body to manage,” informed an official, on condition of anonymity., the ghmc figures suggest that 3,300 mt is lifted every day using a workforce of around 23,000 in different aspects – from sweeping streets to collection and shifting to the dump yard at jawaharnagar. the workforce includes approximately 3,000 men and women who are civic body employees. “at one time, there were more than 6,000 workers and the number dropped with retirements and no fresh intake,” another official said, also preferring not to be identified., spread across the city, the ghmc had earlier set up 3,000 garbage bins of different measurements and as officials pointed out, there would be no more than 1,500 in place now with most of the available ones in bad shape. since the last few years, there was no stock taken on the condition of the bins and no effort made to replace the lost and damaged ones, he lamented., shifting the collected garbage itself had been mired in issues for long with the condition of vehicles used objected to by many. the sight of most of these vehicles leaving behind a trail of waste spilling from them on the roads is not very uncommon., the fleet presently deployed for garbage-moving has 300 vehicles that comprise 25 tonners, 10 tonners, dumpers and small tippers. “a proposal to acquire about 50 big and medium vehicles has been hanging fire for more than a year,” pointed out the official., efforts to acquire dumping sites come to naught, the ghmc presently uses the nearly 330 acre dump yard at jawaharnagar to deposit all the collected waste and its efforts to acquire more sites have come to nought so far. few years ago, an exercise was taken up to identify sites to locate dump yards and official teams went scouting in different parts of the city including shadnagar, patancheru and shamirpet., one site at choutuppal in nalgonda district was selected and even paper transactions were completed with the district administration but ensuing public resentment and interference by politicians ensured it remained on the backburner., soon after he took over as chief minister, k. chandrasekhar rao, in june 2014, underscored the need for safe and effective disposal of garbage and directed the ghmc to develop more dumping yards, at least 10 to 15 in different places around the city. however, almost a year later, not much appears to have been done on the issue., a few years ago, the ghmc had entered into an agreement with a private firm, ramky, for the integrated solid waste management project at jawaharnagar with the agency expected to take up the job of collection, transportation and disposal of garbage. however, the civic body could only ensure the disposal aspect of the project for the firm, which had the entire concept ending up in delays and confusion., grand plans for swachh

at the issue from a holistic perspective by improvising the waste management process and promoting waste-to-energy units with a total capacity of about 1,033 mw, to begin with, through various incentives., the nature of the mission is set to become clear by august 15 when the niti aayog’s sub-committee of chief ministers that looks into swachh bharat mission will submit its report to the centre., a decision on the deadline for report was taken at a meeting of the sub-committee led by andhra pradesh chief minister chandrababu naidu held in bengaluru on wednesday., briefing reporters

toilets., pointing out that the country generated 1,33,760 metric tonnes of waste a day, he said it was possible to set up waste-to-energy plants with a total capacity of 1,033 mw with these resources. the sub-committee would take up the issue with various authorities to offer incentives such as rebates in vat and central taxes to these units so that energy cost could be reduced to rs. 6

the garbage is not strewn across but stashed in a corner. a year after prime minister narendra modi announced the swachh bharat abhiyan, delhi’s transit hubs narrate a story of gradual revival despite battling with the habits of janta., railway stations in the capital sprung a surprise with at least the major ones depicting a comparatively cleaner picture. with housekeeping being recently outsourced, station premises are swept and mopped more frequently., at anand vihar railway station, the cleanliness spree seems to be so over the top that it’s almost a phenyl attack the moment one steps on to the platform — a bearable departure from the usual odour of stale food and urine., the swachh bharat abhiyan, however, seems to have given the tracks a miss. in all the stations, human excreta, food and flies litter the tracks, while the drainage systems were clogged. strangely, the authorities have left it to manual labour for cleaning these tracks despite “track cleaning machines” being launched in march last year., “machines are used to clean the tracks when there is vip movement in the station. i remember they were used on october 2, when the cleanliness drive was launched,” said rajinder kumar, a track cleaner at old delhi railway station., mechanical cleaning of the floors is a rare sight, but sweepers have visibly increased and so have the number of dustbins on platforms, waiting areas, ticketing areas and other locations. however, stainless steel dustbins could be spotted primarily in new delhi railway station, which witnesses over five lakh passengers on a daily basis. in stations like old delhi, plastic bins were found broken or with holes. thankfully, the authorities have started lacing the bin with garbage bags., even as stations such as hazrat nizamuddin and sarai rohilla posed a pleasant picture, smaller ones like delhi junction (old delhi), sadar bazar, shahdara and nangloi seem to be the forgotten lot., “swachh bharat has changed the situation from unbearable to somewhat bearable. although, the focus is mostly on bigger stations, i have noticed that now at least cleaning is regularly done. but, the toilets are in abysmal state forcing men to urinate in the open while women and children suffer the most,” said munna jha, a trader who takes the daily local from sadar bazar station., “of 33 stations in the delhi area, in 29 stations contracts are now in place and four are being cleaned on a regular basis. in seven months, 28,360 people have been fined. we have collected rs.28 lakh,” said arun arora, divisional railway manager (delhi division)., the isbts, too, had varying degrees of cleanliness with the one at kashmere gate being the cleanest. “the campaign has made people aware, even as there remains a class who invariably litter. i have been a sweeper here for the past three years, this isbt looks far better now,” said om pal singh.",0.05595376845376845,"freedom filth , stink","railway bus stations presented comparatively cleaner picture. seen , cleaning progress old delhi railway station kashmere gate isbt ( right ) . — photos : pranay gupta &amp;

2015-09-18,mayors stumble on smart city mission,"on the morning of september 4, a group of mayors from various states of north india arrived at a luxury hotel in new delhi to attend a workshop on the national democratic alliance (nda) government’s smart city mission. in his opening remarks, union urban development minister venkaiah naidu said the bharatiya janata party-led government has formulated “radical policy” shifts in india’s urban governance that empowers mayors to take back control of cities from states and encourages them to be self-reliant., but as the workshop continued, one could cut through the official rhetoric and pick holes in the smart city initiative. from a logistical standpoint, the mayors, who are frontrunners of the mission, found it hard to follow the mission guidelines. previous urban development schemes had rendered them powerless and they were reduced to mere bystanders watching the central government handing over projects to state ministers. as the new set of urban policies — smart city mission, swachh bharat mission, atal mission for rejuvenation and urban transformation (amrut) — claim to transfer powers of designing and building cities to municipalities, the shift has been overwhelming., the mandate, sidelining state ministries, establishes direct contact between the municipal bodies and the urban development ministry, and the coordination assures easy access to central funding with minimum bureaucratic delays. on the other hand, the municipal commissioners, who are trained to administer the city services, are struggling to make the transition from being armchair bureaucrats to on-ground managers, tasked with designing solutions to meet peoples’ “aspirations”., for the entire mission, the centre has asked the states to generate half the funding (rs. 48,000 crore) through public-private partnerships. and mayors are encouraged to use their political clout to attract private investors., if all these elements work in tandem, the government is optimistic that one smart city will inspire an urban sprawl expected to function more on private investments, less on government funding. the endgame is to generate as many urban centres as possible and ensure a double digit gdp. , to speed up growth for a slowing economy and create a consuming class of city dwellers, the role of a municipal body is crucial. since the smart city initiative is cutting out aggressive state spending, municipalities have to generate funds from private investors and take capacity-building measures to initiate big projects. but that is precisely where the shortcoming exists. at the end of the workshop, when the floor was thrown open for questions, mamta pandey, mayor of satna municipal corporation in madhya pradesh, asked the panellists if she could construct a hospital instead of a smart city. though her town has qualified to build one, the question was irrelevant, evidence that ms. pandey was not familiar with the project guidelines. and ms. pandey is not the only mayor out of touch with the shifting urban demographics. speaking to the hindu, captain j.m. pathania, director, urban development in himachal pradesh, who also attended the workshop, said it is a rare sight to see mayors well-informed about the government policies. most of them, he said, are devoted to pleasing their political patrons., shadow of jnnurmin the recent past, the efforts of roping in private investors to quickly transform societies have often hindered urban progress. between 2008 and 2014, the previous congress-led united progressive alliance (upa) government rolled out the ambitious jawaharlal nehru national urban renewal mission (jnnurm), and partially relied on private sector investments to speed up its implementation. much to their dismay, private investors refused to come forward. out of 2,900 jnnurm projects, only 50 projects were backed by the public-private-partnership (ppp) model, with a private sector capital investment of just about rs. 1,000 crore, which barely covered 0.2 per cent of the total project cost.",0.02291821273964131,mayors stumble smart city mission,"morning september

2015-09-20,‘there is systematic shift of consumers from internet to mobile’ ,"sketch: l. balamurugan , bajaj finance, a major player among non-banking financial companies is planning to profitably mix consumer, sme, commercial, rural lending and fee-based product distribution, and offer a mix of secured and unsecured assets. rajeev jain, managing director, bajaj finance, said in an e-mail interview with the hindu about the company’s prospects. edited excerpts., how is 2015-16 panning out so far for the financial services industry as well as bajaj finance, given that we are in the last month of the first half?, the finance industry in india is presently witnessing a revolution by adopting disruptive technology. new licences, smartphones, aadhar identification, e-sign, payments banks, imps and other technology-related revolutions - some regulated, some design based, some market related. in a large market like india, there are always opportunities to grow if a win-win value proposition is created. we at bajaj finance continue to work on the same and are quite happy with our progress so far. our diversified business model is quite helpful in maintaining growth as we cater to customers across consumer/sme and commercial clients. our technology platforms provide us an edge over competition as we have not only been able to successfully implement technology, but also ensure that all concerns of clients are taken into consideration to ease the process for them., banks have also progressed on retail lending business and given their aggression in the segment, do they now pose a big challenge for nbfcs? if yes, what is your strategy?, india is a very big market with ample opportunity for all and there cannot be dearth of opportunity. we have set a 25-30 per cent growth trajectory for us as a company and we do not see any challenges at this point in over achieving this objective. our strategy is to strike a balance between existing customers and new customers. a significant part of our business growth continues to come from existing customers, where we leverage our analytics and technology to offer sharp propositions. we believe we can do a lot of things to increase wallet share of our own customers which will be the major contributor for our growth expectations., our focus is to profitably mix consumer, sme, commercial, rural lending and fee based product distribution, as well as offer a mix of secured and unsecured assets. our deep geographic distribution also helps us leverage large and growing customer franchise, as also attract, train and retain talent – we are regularly expanding so as to cater to more and more customers., do you see any pick-up in the consumer loans this festive season, given the overall sluggishness in sentiment and slowdown in gdp growth?, each festive season is a lift from a normal month. we do not see any deviation this year too, though unseasonal monsoon led to some challenges from april to july. monsoon deficit in some parts of country and uncertain global environment is indicative of changes in consumer mood for shopping. having said this, independence day weekend (august 15), which in a way is the signal for coming festive season, saw good retail sales. further, september events will shape how consumer mood pans out., banks are engaging their customers on the mobile/digital platform in a very big way. how is bajaj finance engaging its large customer base on the digital side?, innovation and convenience are key to survival in this digital era. we have a very large volume of business and hence, it is wise as well as essential for us to leverage digital platforms. we have been leveraging the digital platform from quite some time now. for instance, we adopted cloud computing since 2009, we service our customers with loan details as well as any query they have on self-service basis from our website from long, we have 2.5 mm customer traffic on our website each month, we started 100 per cent digital loan approval process 3 years ago and are quite encouraged with our progress., we offer four products to be serviced end-to-end digitally and this channel contributes as high as 15-20 per cent of our monthly volumes for some of these businesses., we are also seeing systematic movement of consumers from internet to mobile. for example, on our online platform as many as two-third customers come to us from mobile., hence, this festive season, we plan to leverage the mobile channel quite effectively. we are working on creating capabilities which will ease the process of loan taking for our customers from their mobile phones. we are quite excited with this project., bajaj finance has exited infrastructure financing. why have you taken such a step, when national priority as espoused by prime minister narendra modi is to develop physical infrastructure?, we have always ventured into a business after careful evaluation with right propositions, aiming for sustained growth., we believe in presence in selected segments where we have been or can be a relevant player. given the dynamics of the infrastructure business in terms of competitive positioning or from credit performance, we do not feel we can get to market relevance in that business and hence, we have decided to exit financing infrastructure segment., how is your sme lending and commercial lending business segment performing in this fiscal, so far? what is your outlook for this year?, our biggest differentiator in the sme business is our fast approval turn-around time and flow based underwriting on cloud platform., the use of new technology as also least number of documents requirement make us a frontrunner in the business. bajaj finance is focused on high net worth smes with an average annual sales of rs.25 crore with established financials and demonstrated borrowing track records. in the first quarter this year, our sme business witnessed steady growth and on an average maintained over 60 per cent y-o-y growth., bajaj finance is quite upbeat about rural lending business. given your focus on consumer durable loans, lifestyle product loans, do you think you would see continued success in the rural lending segment, given that monsoon has played havoc in rural karnataka and significant parts of maharashtra?, we believe that for most product categories rural india offers great opportunities. as we rolled out our business in rural india 3 years ago, we have gained some experience in the business. we are quite upbeat with the progress and feel that rural india offers great opportunity for all our products., yes, deficit monsoon is a material event, however its impact will be different in different parts of the country. given our relatively small size in the overall rural lending space, we do not foresee significant challenges to our rural growth strategy., we need to keep in mind that both rural consumers and business owners have the same aspirations as urban and hence, they need financial service products as much as urban. we will continue to grow in this business., bajaj finance raised some rs.1,400 crore earlier in 2015, how do you intend to deploy funds and to which segment? what are your expansion plans?, we have asset growth rates of over 25 per cent and that needs capital to be deployed., we also have a strong pipeline of products as well as product extension besides planned geographic expansion., hence, we intend to continue the growth momentum and raise capital., bajaj finance missed getting universal banking licence, and you did not apply for either small finance bank or payments banks licence. so, what’s next for bajaj finance?",0.12124599166265836,‘there systematic shift consumers internet mobile ’,"sketch : l. balamurugan , bajaj finance , major player among non-banking financial companies planning profitably mix consumer , sme , commercial , rural lending fee-based product distribution , offer mix secured unsecured assets. rajeev jain , managing director , bajaj finance , said e-mail interview hindu company ’ prospects. edited excerpts. , 2015-16 panning far financial services industry well bajaj finance , given last month first half?

2015-09-29,can modi do a swachh bharat on public safety?,"deaths or tragedies are the sad part of human life and nothing much can be done about them. but the manner in which people are killed in some of the tragedies that has grabbed news headline these past few months is quite dreadful to say the least. reading about it on a regular basis, and as a country we should worry about the safety of citizens. a country as large in size and population as india will probably be prone to mishaps. statistics will give proof that india as a country will come across as more vulnerable when it comes to public tragedies. this, however, should not put us into sigh or inaction. we need to turn attention to the question of safety for a billion plus population and this need to come into the forefront of our public discourse, which at present is not there. public safety ought to be a priority as the clean india (swachh bharat) campaign. hopefully prime minister narendra modi can take the lead in addressing this equally fundamental right of every citizen to live in safety., the latest in a long list of tragic accidents reported from across the country this year alone is >the death of over 100 people and nearly 150 injured after a massive blast caused by mining explosives stored in a building ripped through a crowded area in petlwad town in jhabua district of madhya pradesh. the deadly accident happened on september 12, triggered by gelatine sticks, used for mining, that were illegally stored along with lpg cylinders in a nearby home. on the same day, two british women were killed and 11 people injured after three carriages of a >tourist train derailed on its way to the himalayan city of shimla. and if that was not enough, in yet another accident, two people were killed as nine coaches of a duronto express going from secunderabad to mumbai >derailed in karnataka early on september 12. just a few months back, the derailment of two trains in madhya pradesh’s harda town had killed at least 31 people and several left injured., just consider that in the last few months alone there has been countless number of people killed, not in terror strikes by militants, but of innocent citizens who have fallen victim because they live in a dangerous country, which is evident from india's poor safety track record. whether it is the death toll arising out of accidents involving our public transport system, the construction sector, roads, food, medicines or just about the risk to life and limb from the larger eco-system around us, including the >most recent stampede in andhra pradesh during the holy dip, something must be done to ensure better safety of our citizens. it does not require rocket science theory to understand that the casualty from some of the accidents cited above is higher than — say soldiers killed in recent terrorist strikes., recent media reports on a range of tragic events will throw light on perhaps what needs to be done across different concerns but all related to public safety measures and the response that must come. for instance, toxic or adulterated liquor takes a heavy toll of lives each year. as per media reports, the death toll from a >recent hooch tragedy in mumbai, maharashtra was 98 with many others under treatment in various hospitals. every passing year scores of people die after consuming unsafe liquor. the issue of bootlegging and adulterated liquor that is sold illegally is a chronic problem that will need more stringent measures besides having a relook at liquor prohibition policy., then take the case of counterfeit medicines or drugs. in a startling disclosure recently, the central bureau investigation (cbi) director anil sinha, while speaking at the first indo-french workshop on ‘combating counterfeit medicine’, pointed out that more people have died due to consuming counterfeit medicines than those who have died of terrorism in the last 40 years. the cbi director was quoting an estimate of international agency interpol. and as mentioned by him, though the problem in india has not reached an alarming proportion, “nevertheless we cannot ignore this global menace, which is slowly taking the shape of a transnational organised crime”. to stop circulation of spurious drugs in india and protect consumers will require alertness of our security systems., other more visible endanger to public safety can be seen almost on a regular basis — those involving our public transport system, roads and other public service utilities. a few weeks ago, around 15 people were killed after a >high-tension wire fell on a bus in rajasthan; 22 people died after >a van fell into the godavari river in andhra pradesh; five were killed in punjab after a >leak in an ammonia gas tanker; still later 17, including five children were killed in a tractor-truck collision. and earlier around this time last year, 61 construction workers were killed and several others injured in a >building collapse in chennai. a building collapse in january in the tourist resort of goa claimed at least 14 lives. a few years ago, the collapse of a> lalita park building in east delhi had killed 71 people., remember these are casualty figures for only the recent past. deaths from unsafe building construction, traffic violation and other poor safety standards in india will be staggering. even after several commissions of enquiries or reports prepared, why are we still witnessing illegal and unauthorized practices endangering public safety? even in the latest accident at jhabua, the madhya pradesh government was very prompt to order a judicial inquiry. but what has been the benefit of such probes when remedial measures are not acted on? have we the public cared to even ask the government to put such reports in the public domain? have people been brought to book for committing offenses that compromise public safety? perhaps large scale corruption along with the general poor standard that we maintain and encourage, especially in the government (public) sector ought to be blamed. as in the case of crimes like terrorism or murder, the rule of law must also work to deter public safety hazards., ironically even for the media, when accidents or tragic events take place, it makes front-page news but the issue of public safety is not given too much importance perhaps because of its low advertising value. once a tragedy serves its purpose of making news, the question of public safety vanishes into oblivion until the next tragedy strikes. the media in india must give greater prominence to the question of public safety so that the required attention is brought to bear on public policy.",-0.04435132051411124,modi swachh bharat public safety ?,"deaths tragedies

2015-10-01,"scripting clean polls, via aadhaar","having photos printed on the electoral rolls was a step towards making identification easier at the polling station. photo: v. raju , the election commission (ec) starts its annual revision of electoral rolls throughout the country in september ever year. the exercise becomes more significant for the states going to the polls the following year. elections are due in assam, kerala, tamil nadu, west bengal and puducherry in the first half of the next year., except in the states where polls are scheduled, the political parties and the voters are generally apathetic to the roll-revision work. in the poll-bound states, however, the political parties can be hyperactive, as happened in tamil nadu prior to the> 2006 assembly elections when party leaders were given targets for registration of voters, leading to allegations of malpractices and, as a result, filing of cases by the ec against some party functionaries., multiple enrolments by voters the ec’s efforts to have a clean electoral roll with full enrolment often falters due to a variety of reasons. relentless urbanisation and inter-and intra-city movements pose a challenge to having an updated and accurate electoral roll in urban areas. a study carried out in bengaluru prior to the 2008 >assembly elections in karnataka revealed that the year-on-year change varied from 6 to 8 per cent., in the rural areas, though the booth level officer (blo) system works better in tracking changes, the problems there are of a different kind. the election law is clear that a person can be registered as a voter in a place where he is ordinarily resident. however, thanks to various ‘collateral’ issues, persons who are not ‘ordinarily resident’ at a place continue to be on the electoral rolls. for instance, come election time, there is an exodus from chennai to the southern districts of tamil nadu as people from these areas who have settled in chennai flock to their respective native places to exercise their franchise., the duplication due to their enrolment in electoral rolls of both their respective native places and chennai is an invitation to bogus voting., in the run up to the uttar pradesh assembly elections in 2007, an intensive checking of rolls revealed many cases of people who had migrated to mumbai decades earlier but continued to be on the electoral rolls in their native place as, for them, having their names on the electoral rolls was an additional proof for claims on family property., prior to the gujarat elections of 2008, a member of parliament from mumbai had brought to the ec’s notice names of voters found on the electoral rolls both in mumbai and in a constituency in north gujarat. the chief election officer (ceo) of gujarat issued a warning that being listed in more than one place was an offence and his vigilant efforts to prevent any large-scale duplication proved to be a sufficient disincentive, except for a dozen or so voters., seasonal migration of labour from bihar, eastern up, jharkhand and madhya pradesh is a well-known phenomenon; some may even stay back much longer as is the case in jalandhar where, after getting jobs in the textile industry there, migrant agricultural labourers from bihar have continued their stay. according to a recent report, in tamil nadu alone, there is a >labour force comprising nearly 10 lakh people hailing from northern states. they constitute a potential bogus voter pool in their native places., duplication of names on electoral rolls is prevalent in places like an urban area and its neighbouring villages as well as in villages on either side of state borders. recently, a voter proudly told me that he has two >voter identity cards, one with the address of his rural home near chennai and the other with his city address., prior to the 2006 assembly elections in kerala, the then ceo found an abnormal increase in the voter population in two constituencies, one in the palakkad district and the other in the kasargod district. he traced it to a duplication in registration — the voters had been on the rolls of both the districts and the adjoining areas of coimbatore and mangalore. in the manjeshwar constituency of the kasargod district, the names of nearly five thousand such bogus voters were struck down, which, incidentally, had been the margin of victory in the previous elections., for the 2008 assembly elections in rajasthan and madhya pradesh, the election commission, fearing a similar occurrence in the border villages, scheduled the polls on the same date in all adjoining constituencies ., aware of the large-scale migration of labour for surat’s diamond industry from districts in saurashtra, the ceo of gujarat did a name comparison of voters in the varachha constituency of surat district — largely inhabited by migrants from saurashtra — and a couple of constituencies in the districts of their origin, and found out 50,000 potential cases of duplication. an advertisement for voluntary declaration led to only 2,000 disclosures. appreciating the impossibility of physically verifying the rest of the 48,000 entries, the ec opted to schedule polls in surat and in the selected districts of saurashtra on the same day, though they were not contiguous areas., it was the redoubtable t.n. seshan, former cec, who conceived the idea of an electors photo identity card (epic) issued by the election commission to contain bogus voting. his diktat of ‘no id card, no polls’ was opposed by politicians in several poll-bound states, citing a lack of funds. ultimately peace was brokered under the supreme court’s directions and, ever since, photo id cards have come to be the mainstay in establishing a voter’s identity. however, from time to time, innovative excuses are proffered to prevent their use. in the run-up to the 2007 punjab assembly elections, the then chief minister sought exemption from production of photo ids by voters, alleging that the opposition party was purchasing cards to prevent voting by a section of the population., reference point to avoid duplicationhaving photos printed on the electoral rolls was a step towards making identification easier at the polling station. but even photo id card is no answer to the problem of duplicate registrations. the photo id card was designed to have a unique number but there was no way to prevent a second card from being issued to the same person if he/she did not voluntarily disclose information as there was no reliable reference point against which checking could be done. a matching of photos was the only option but it is enormously time-consuming and needs physical verification before coming to a final conclusion. it is here that aadhaar provides a clean and easy solution., since aadhaar has a reliable backing by way of fingerprint and iris scan for identification, the scope for duplication is next to nil. further, and more importantly, to verify for duplication, election officials will require >nothing more than an aadhaar number — not even the fingerprint or iris scan — and, where necessary, will have to query the unique identification authority of india (uidai) website for just a ‘yes’ or ‘no’ answer for the authenticity of the number., the question of a breach of privacy is a complete non-starter in this arrangement. as the role of aadhaar goes up, the system of an elector’s photo identity card (epic) can be phased out, saving cost. with aadhaar, it is possible to enrol a person in a polling station/constituency and simultaneously remove his name from a different polling station/constituency, thus avoiding duplication and also making voter enrolment simpler.",0.11124492432631963,"scripting clean polls , via aadhaar","photos

2015-10-10,grime on the ghat,"faith and hope are the two wheels that have kept varanasi moving since time immemorial. | photo credit: k_r_deepak , these days, those using public toilets in varanasi are gently reminded that they have prime minister narendra modi to thank for the relief. these public utilities have been given a facelift with walls on three sides — passers-by can still watch you in the act — and a roof, on which sits a water tank. they have been painted a deep shade of saffron and bear a proud proclamation: ‘pradhan mantri shri narendra modi ji ki prerana se (inspired by prime minister narendra modi)’., when i first spot a urinal, a rickshaw-puller is there, and as i look at his back and then at the slogan, i wonder what exactly is inspired by modi: his act or the facelift?, of course, it has to be the urinal, but since it looks filthy in spite of the fresh paint, the proclamation seems open to interpretation. unlike this man, many others choose the open drain rather than the revamped facility., a labourer squatting across the road says, “the stench is unbearable. the water tank is empty, the pipe has come off, the taps don’t work. they used poor quality material, which didn’t last even a month.”, “do you find varanasi cleaner than before?” , “why ask me, babu?” he says, taking a long drag from his bidi. “walk down the road and you will see for yourself.”, i had seen it for myself, of course, when the autorickshaw had brought me from mughal sarai to varanasi some days before, via the residential neighbourhood of lanka. what had struck me was the filth, even though my eyes are long used to the sight of garbage — and this is a city represented in parliament by modi, the country’s chief executive, who wants a swachh bharat, or clean india. reality, clearly, lay outside the realm of social media., while nearly everybody i speak to agrees that varanasi remains just as dirty as before, in spite of modi being in power for a year and a half, no one wants to blame him for the mess., “give him some more time, he doesn’t have a magic wand,” says a trader., “why blame modi when the people of varanasi don’t have any civic sense? you will see them throwing rubbish on the road from the terrace,” says an artist., “modi wants to clean up varanasi but the state government is stalling his schemes. the state government wants the city to remain dirty to show modiji in a poor light,” says the manager of a lodge., “modiji is trying his best, but the ministers he has assigned to look after varanasi aren’t doing enough. they come here, pose for the cameras and go back. he should send spies instead of ministers to see what’s going on,” says the owner of an art gallery., “he is the prime minister, he has bigger worries, but i am 100 per cent sure he will improve the condition of varanasi. why 100 per cent, i am 200 per cent sure,” says a teacher., faith and hope are the two wheels that have kept varanasi moving since time immemorial, and these responses are in keeping with the spirit of the holy city, even though everyone, when i ask them if their lives had changed in any way ever since modi became the prime minister, replies with an emphatic “no”., “how can one modi change our lives?” says the art gallery owner. “who is modi anyway to change our lives? kashi is the city of lord vishwanath — no one else matters in this city.”, he is right. modi, if you walk the streets of the city, is barely visible in varanasi — except in the signage at public urinals. actually, there is one more spot in the city where his presence is overwhelming: assi ghat., assi ghat sits on the southern extreme of the row of 84 ghats that constitute the riverfront of varanasi, and has been in the news recently for being completely renovated, by mr. modi of course., “all my life i didn’t even know that stone steps existed at assi ghat because it remained buried under silt,” deepak jaiswal, the caretaker of my lodge, tells me as i set out for the ghat one evening. “go take a look now, modiji has cleaned it up. pura chakachak hai (it’s all spruced up)!”, assi ghat looks spruced up no doubt, designed to impress tourists more than pilgrims: a new stage has been erected to host cultural events; benches with backrests (something that ghats at varanasi never had) have been installed at various places; and, instead of the modi-inspired urinal, it has a state-of-the-art toilet complex, run by sulabh international., it was sulabh that cleaned up the ghat and is now maintaining it — the central government sanctioned close to rs.30 crore for the project, formally titled “development of area around assi ghat, varanasi” — and i find sulabh sweepers constantly at work, one of them dislodging silt from the base of the ghat with the help of a hosepipe., initially, however, earthmovers were used to remove the silt, and the machines — being machines — could not distinguish between silt and stone and ended up damaging the tall octagonal platforms (called marhi by the locals) at the adjoining ganga mahal ghat. they are yet to be repaired, their broken stones a testimony to the force with which the clean-up was carried out., from assi ghat, i walk downstream to prabhu ghat, one of my two favourite ghats of varanasi, the other being darbhanga ghat. i like them because they are clean, set against handsome, historical structures, and have an old-world feel about them — ideal spots in the city to gaze at the river., at prabhu ghat, i find young men with guitars sitting on the steps. loudspeakers are being set up and standees erected. a musical programme is about to begin: a radio channel is celebrating the first anniversary of a show in which budding singers from the city are invited to perform, and many of those singers are in attendance now., a small audience has already gathered, among them a lady who stands out because every now and then, someone or the other, mostly young men, touch her feet., “who is she?” i ask the boatman, a boy of 17, who has become friendly with me in a matter of minutes., “she is the one who cleaned up prabhu ghat,” he says., “was this ghat also dirty?”, “unimaginably dirty. go talk to her,” the boy says., the lady, temsutula imsong, who is 32 now, was born in a village called ungma in nagaland. she studied in shillong, went on to work in delhi, and in 2012, came to ghazipur, near varanasi, to join an ngo started by her friend — an ex-navy man — who is now her husband. that’s how she first set eyes on the ghats of varanasi., “this ghat was an open toilet when i first saw it,” she told me. “it was buried under silt — you couldn’t see the steps — and people were relieving themselves wherever they pleased. it irked me.”, one day in march this year, she and a woman friend — who has now left varanasi — pooled in some money, bought brooms, buckets, masks and some basic equipment, and, enlisting the support of local boatmen and idlers on the ghat, began cleaning it., “were you inspired by the swachh bharat campaign?”, “no, nothing like that. though when we were cleaning up the place, we could hear passersby saying, ‘see, see, modiji’s campaign is going on!’”, modi has acknowledged her work. he mentioned her name in two tweets, she said. a local paper called her ‘kashi ki bahu’ — the daughter-in-law of kashi, or varanasi. “i take that as a compliment, even though that’s not correct, i am the daughter-in-law of ghazipur,” she laughs. as i sit with her on the steps, more boys touch her feet as they walk past.",0.076771514537472,grime ghat,"faith hope two wheels kept varanasi moving since time immemorial. &#124; photo credit : k_r_deepak , days , using public toilets varanasi gently reminded prime minister narendra modi thank relief. public utilities given facelift walls three sides — passers-by still watch act — roof , sits water tank. painted deep shade saffron bear proud proclamation : ‘pradhan mantri shri narendra modi ji ki prerana se ( inspired prime minister narendra modi ) ’ . , first spot urinal , rickshaw-puller , look back slogan , wonder exactly inspired modi : act facelift?

2015-11-21,"our waste, our responsibility","we need to ensure that human waste is disposed of in a safe, humane and sustainable manner. , early in september this year, the legendary prof. robert chambers visited a village in uttar pradesh to survey the progress of the swachh bharat mission. in one home, he went down on his knees and put his hand in literally to inspect the contents of the twin pit latrine there., the idea was to allay the fears and scepticism of the villagers and show them that the human waste in the five-year-old pit had changed completely into compost, with no odour or contaminants, and was ready to use as fertiliser., few of us would do what prof. chambers did, and he in turn was merely following in the footsteps of gandhi. but with world toilet day just going by on november 19 and the government now levying a swachh bharat cess on our incomes, it is time to think of not just superficial ways to improve cleanliness but to go deeper and jolt us out of our deeply ingrained notions of purity and pollution., as swachh bharat slogans buzz around us, many scholars warn that this mission’s fate will be similar to previous experiments such as nirmal bharat abhiyan and total sanitation campaign if primacy is not given to changing hygiene behaviour rather than to merely meet toilet construction targets., last year’s squat report showed clearly that most indians continue to believe in perverse notions of ‘purity and pollution’ driven by rigid brahminical ideas wherein polluting the external environment is taken for granted while homes are kept ‘clean’ by not building or using toilets indoors. as long as this mindset continues, the idea of a ‘clean india’ cannot materialise., this is the reason why the issue of open defecation must be opened up, public conversations created around it, and collective action initiated. the situation is ironic because the act of defecation is kept outside the home, thus attempting to hide it, but by defecating outside people are exposing themselves in public., the real idea of ‘purity and pollution’ must be linked to healthy living and physical and mental wellbeing. this puts diarrhoeal deaths, malnutrition and stunted growth at the forefront and makes safe sanitary conditions primary. second, the message needs to be driven in that it is not someone else’s responsibility to clean your waste, but your own., a recent news report told a horrifying story of a young dalit boy being asked to clean up a schoolmate’s excreta. manual scavenging persists, despite laws banning it. all of it is due to the age-old notion of individual purity being maintained by the labour of others. a recent paper by jnu scholar amit thorat and the rice institute’s dean spears talks of how our sanitation habits are deeply rooted in caste and untouchability practices., one way to address this would be to ensure the presence and participation of dalits and other communities, who have been exploited as society’s ‘cleaners’, in the decision making at each level. they must be a part of mandated decision-making bodies such as village water and sanitation committees, district water and sanitation missions/ committees and state water and sanitation missions so that they can influence sanitation planning, implementation and monitoring., could the marketplace provide some answers? for this, it is worth looking at some examples of how companies have transformed consumers into responsible customers. today, a mcdonald’s customer collects the food, pays for it, consumes it and then disposes of the waste. similarly, travellers taking flights are increasingly buying tickets, doing self check-ins and carrying their luggage on their own. while a mcdonald’s may follow this method to cut costs, the logic could be institutionalised to inculcate the idea of the individual taking responsibility for the safe disposal of the waste produced by defecating in the open. but this also means that the government must ensure that the poor, who still can’t afford basic housing (whether in rural or urban areas), are not penalised for open defecation by this logic of citizen’s accountability — unless they are included within a broader umbrella where such basic services are provided for them by the government., in fact, even people who use a flushable toilet need to be told that there is no guarantee that the waste they create is being safely disposed of at the end of the sanitation cycle. a recent faecal management study conducted by wateraid india finds that new delhi, with the best sewage treatment capacity in the country, is at present able to treat only about 60 per cent of the total sewerage being produced, leaving 40 per cent untreated in the open environment. in essence, it would not be wrong to suggest that 40 per cent of delhi’s population indirectly defecates in the open. the challenge is to create a narrative of responsibility and awareness around this., while state accountability is undoubtedly a part of it, citizen accountability, especially of the well-off sections, needs to be addressed. in this context, the story of the sanitation drive in 19th century london needs to be redesigned and re-disseminated in india. it was only after the elite began to be badly impacted by cholera epidemics in london that they began to take the issue of sanitation and hygiene seriously. the narrative of a campaign, therefore, needs to weave in both the rich and the poor in a role of common responsibility and complementarity to ensure the larger health of the society. the swachh bharat mission would merely provide an entry point to this., at the policy level, the government needs to invest adequately in behavioural change. ironically, the present government has cut down the budget ratio for this from 15 per cent to a meagre 8 per cent. but even that small amount rarely gets utilised due to a hardware-obsessed bureaucracy. similarly, 60-70 per cent of the budget earmarked to rehabilitate manual scavengers is returned unutilised every year because it is on nobody’s priority list. and the business of cleaning up someone else’s waste continues unabated.",0.044905364322840036,"waste , responsibility","need ensure human waste disposed safe , humane sustainable manner. , early september year , legendary prof. robert chambers visited village

2015-12-28,the map of neighbourly outreach,"the dramatic diplomacy that unfolded across >afghanistan-pakistan-india on christmas day may be the first clear admission from prime minister narendra modi that >dealing with pakistan is not a simple task. and that his government’s ill-thought-out jingoism of its early months in power needs to be tempered with a mature and realistic approach if he has to focus on and achieve the grand slogans ranging from “swachh bharat” to “make in india”., ever since mr. modi swept to power in the summer of 2014, his foreign policy has been packed mostly with spectacle and some boldness. he kicked off by inviting the south asian association for regional cooperation (saarc) leaders to his swearing-in, but soon let strident rhetoric lead the bilateral engagement with pakistan. that early spark of hope was dashed by aggressive statements from the highest levels, and almost a wanton abandonment of restraint along the international border (ib) and the line of control (loc)., the initial freezediplomatic engagements with pakistan nosedived to embarrassing childishness. in august 2014, foreign secretary-level talks were called off after the pakistani high commissioner, abdul basit, met kashmiri separatists; the same excuse was given a year later to call off national security adviser (nsa)-level talks in new delhi. the modi government’s strategy gave a new lease of life to hurriyat factions, while adversely affecting the situation in the kashmir valley and along the ib and the loc., militant infiltration and the occasional provocation from across the border have long been the routine, but the tough posture adopted in the wake of the april-may general election in india coincided with, if not resulted in, a dramatic rise in cross-border firings. dozens of civilians and many paramilitary personnel were killed or injured, and normal life along the border was disrupted., the pattern of terrorists sneaking into india from across the border and, within hours, launching attacks on a target close to the border, be it a security installation or a civilian target such as gurdaspur in punjab in july 2015, became more pronounced. in the kashmir valley, the fog of war intensified. while more local youth took to militancy, the mysterious rise of flamboyant militant commanders, their unusual escape from several encounter scenes, and final elimination after a few months of their stardom was a recurrent phenomenon., the new aggressive phase wasn’t all that surprising, given the verbal volleys lobbed by mr. modi against pakistan in the run-up to the 2014 general election., reality from south blockthe grand settings of lutyens’ delhi have an uncanny capacity to temper a ruler, even if he pretends to be a macho outsider. mr. modi is finally showing signs of realism that his neighbourhood policy cannot be complete without engagement with pakistan. his efforts over the past few weeks, to rekindle india-russia bilateral ties and to reach out to pakistan, are signs that the former gujarat chief minister is now finally becoming the indian prime minister. dramatic summits and humongous announcements do not often account for great diplomacy; it requires patience and perseverance., against the new mature phase of mr. modi’s diplomacy, it was, in hindsight, not a great surprise that he flew into lahore from kabul, on december 25, where the vagaries of violence are interspersed with buried egos of empires and signposts of india’s strategic interests. if afghanistan wasn’t the real reason that prompted mr. modi about the need to calibrate his pakistan policy, then he has to only walk a few yards from his office to an unnamed government bungalow close by, where the widow and children of former afghan president mohammad najibullah have been staying for over a quarter century. it was from the remnants of the afghan mujahideen who fought najibullah’s forces that the kashmir insurgency of the past three decades acquired sophistication, weapons and manpower, after new delhi messed up its kashmir policy., young warriors from madrassas of pakistan who rode into kabul to drag najibullah by a pickup truck, in 1996, and hang him in the streets were soon to shelter the al-qaeda. from this sponsorship by pakistan, of non-state violence and regressive political islam, the world got its new generation of terrorists and their broader ideology. from new york city’s world trade center complex to paris’s bataclan theatre, from mumbai’s streets to the many bombed markets across india, the signatures of violence nurtured by sections of the pakistani establishment and flourishing under its guidance cannot be ignored. precisely for this and other factors, india needs to remain engaged with the pakistani establishment., vajpayee, manmohan singh erasrhetoric about large-scale annihilations and macho responses to a dysfunctional democracy sound impressive in the heat of an election campaign but for a government, the challenge is to find ways to deal with the delinquent next door. mr. modi seems to have now picked up the gauntlet., it is the realisation of the complexity of dealing with pakistan that forced successive prime ministers to risk so much to engage with the neighbour, often without much success. atal bihari vajpayee took the gamble of riding a bus across the contentious border, only to be faced with the kargil incursion a few weeks later. it may be a mere coincidence that nawaz sharif was the one who hosted mr. vajpayee in lahore then, and now mr. modi, despite his perilous survival in a military-dominated state., both mr. vajpayee and manmohan singh worked with a significant number of pakistan experts, within the prime minister’s office and ministry of external affairs and on the track ii circuit, to steer their policies. pakistan is a state like none other. as you sit back taking in the success of diplomatic outreach, militants can sneak across the border to occupy strategic heights; as you prepare for a major push to improving bilateral trade, you may find a few men rowing across the sea to launch a deadly terrorist attack on your commercial capital. pakistan is a state in deep crisis, fighting its many demons, and with statecraft deeply embedded in misguided military chauvinism. however, those, and other factors, cannot be the only issues to dictate india’s engagement with pakistan., the engagement should be primarily informed by the fact that india’s economic growth, including its ability to keep government expenses under check, enjoy global market trust and attract investment, is all critically hinged on a peaceful south asia. no other reason is needed to appreciate why india will have to keep talking to pakistan., dealing with pakistan is like playing football on a rainy day and on a muddy ground. the team needs to have the skill, the ability to anticipate the unexpected, the response without losing one’s nerve, and the stamina to keep playing despite the downpour. no one who has watched the modi government closely will grant all that to his narrow, centralised, decision-making structure where very few seem to have any influence on foreign policy. if the lahore drop-in was the first key step in mr. modi’s new balanced pakistan policy, then it must immediately be followed by a broadbasing of intellectual inputs that inform his decisions., defining permanent intereststhe excuses offered by the modi government to muddy india-pakistan relations over the last year-and-a-half were no new discoveries. for long, even under both mr. vajpayee and dr. singh, india has introduced new goalposts, or moved existing ones. on the sidelines of the saarc summit in kathmandu in 2001, mr. vajpayee’s foreign minister, jaswant singh, was clear with the demand: he produced a list of 20 wanted people allegedly living under state protection in pakistan, and asked that islamabad dismantle the infrastructure of terror. by the end of 2008, after the mumbai attacks, the manmohan singh government’s demands were focussed on action against those responsible for the attack on mumbai.",0.0632361753124465,map neighbourly outreach,"dramatic diplomacy unfolded across >afghanistan-pakistan-india christmas day may first clear admission prime minister narendra modi >dealing pakistan simple task. government ’ ill-thought-out jingoism early months power needs tempered mature realistic approach focus achieve grand slogans ranging “swachh bharat ” “make india ” . , ever since mr. modi swept power summer 2014 , foreign policy packed mostly spectacle boldness. kicked inviting south asian association regional cooperation ( saarc ) leaders swearing-in , soon let strident rhetoric lead bilateral engagement pakistan. early spark hope dashed aggressive statements highest levels , almost wanton abandonment restraint along international border ( ib ) line control ( loc ) . , initial freezediplomatic engagements pakistan nosedived embarrassing childishness. august 2014 , foreign secretary-level talks called pakistani high commissioner , abdul basit , met kashmiri separatists ;

2016-02-26,'increasing polarisation has become the theme of modi government',"former union minister for home and finance, p. chidambaram has been an active player in much of india’s public life in the last three decades. on the eve of launching a book on his columns completing a year in the opposition, called standing guard (rupa publications), he speaks to nistula hebbar and vikas dhoot on nationalism, sedition and what he would have done with an absolute majority in parliament…., , q: why is your book about the year in opposition and not your ten years in office?, , a. (laughs) because that will take a lot more time to write. i am not saying i won’t write about it ever. but this is a contemporary and relevant review of what’s happening in the country every week and putting it together so the reader at the end of the year gets a fairly complete idea about what happened in the country over the year., , q: what is the one thing that stands out in your mind about the nda government in the past year or its 21 months in office?, , a. there are nearly 20 columns on the economy and related subjects. i would have thought at the end of the year, what happened to the economy would be the defining theme of the modi government. unfortunately, i find it is the rise of intolerance and the increasing polarisation which has become the defining theme of the modi government in 2015., , q: do you think he’s a polarising figure?, , a. i think his party and his party’s affiliates have many polarising forces, such as the way they are framing the debate on the jnu episode, on the suicide of rohith vemula, lynching of akhlaq. the frame that they are building around these issues clearly reveals their intent to polarise indian society., , q. you have said in an interview that you have some doubts about the culpability of afzal guru in the parliament attack case?, , a. i said one can hold an honest opinion that the case was not correctly decided and the degree of involvement of afzal guru was not correctly assessed. if someone holds that opinion, he doesn’t become an anti-national. he’s just holding a different opinion., , q: a lot of people would use this to attack the congress party and its days in office when it prosecuted afzal., , a. i didn’t say it’s my opinion. i said if someone holds that opinion, you can’t accuse him of dishonesty or anti-nationalism., , q: in kashmir, the bjp and pdp joined hands to form a government. you had pushed for the dilution of afspa in your tenure as home minister. do you think we would see that happening under the current regime?, , a. i was surprised when pdp and bjp formed a coalition govt. the only rationalisation i can make is perhaps it was unavoidable given the fractured mandate. but it certainly had no moral or political justification. be that as it may, the removal of afspa if not the repeal, is one of the major planks of pdp policy. the bjp is totally opposed to even reviewing afspa. so i am not surprised that afspa has become one of the bones of contention between the pdp and the bjp. i am curious to know how they will resolve it. if they put it on the backburner, both of them are being less than truthful., , q: do you feel that we are back to the 1990s in kashmir?, , a. see, the mind of the kashmiri youth gets affected not only by what happens in the kashmir valley. it also gets affected by what happens elsewhere in india. i think the increased sense of fear and insecurity among the muslims is playing on the minds of muslims all over india, including muslims in kashmir. how can one say that the kashmiri youth are not concerned about what happens to other muslims in the rest of india?, , q: but you don’t see it as a slide back towards the days of militancy…, , a. without full information, it’s difficult to say whether the militants that are active today are home-grown militants or infiltrators from across the border. if they are infiltrators, that has to be dealt it in particular manner. if they are home grown militants, that is more worrying and has to be dealt in a particular manner., , q: do you feel that the way debates are being framed in recent months, is an attempt to divert attention from the mismanagement of the economy?, , a. maybe it was not intended. but that is the consequence. if you frame the debate on such issues in a particular manner, it does distract from the real issues that affect the country, which are issues of bread and butter, income, jobs, investment, growth, development, and infrastructure. obviously, the nation’s attention as well as the government’s attention to these gets diluted because you have framed some other debates in a polarising manner., , q: do you think the government’s being reactive by emphasising so much on farm sector, rural development and even mgnrega in the president’s address to parliament, despite the pm’s earlier stance against mgnrega?, , a. that is the president’s speech. i would like to see how that is reflected in the budget. president’s speech is a statement of intention. budget is a plan of action., , q: in its first year in office, the prime minister made major policy pronouncements such as abolishing a law a day and that it had no business doing business. but little has been said on strategic sales of public sector firms yet, just as we continue to live with several archaic laws., , a. it’s now common ground that the bjp and mr narendra modi over promised and they have under-performed. that’s the general feeling across all sections of people. there is a danger in over promising., , q: what about retrospective taxation., , a. they should repeal it. that section should be amended straightaway and made prospective, if they want to keep that section., , q: how do you react to the fact that vodafone received a tax notice the same week that the prime minister spoke about the undesirability of restrospective taxation?, , a. that shows the disconnect between what is happening at the department level and the thinking of the policy making level. i can only say that those who are making policies are not in full control of the department., , q: some say the government lacks intellectual heft at some levels and there is a gap between the pronouncements at the top and the implementation on the ground, partly due to this government’s governance style of micro-management without a mechanism to facilitate genuine hurdles faced by the bureaucracy. what’s your view?, , a. both these are inevitable consequences of over-centralisation. i wouldn’t go so far as to say there is no intellectual power in the government. but most people simply withdraw. people who can contribute, remain silent. they don’t take the initiative, don’t offer ideas because of the overwhelming feeling that all decisions are centralised in the pmo. this is the price you pay for over-centralisation., , q: if you had mr modi’s numbers in parliament and you were the finance or home minister, what would you have pushed through?, , a. if i had 282 seats, i would have repealed the retrospective tax amendments. i would have certainly amended, if not repealed the afspa. i would have set up the natgrid by law, notified the nctc by law, if necessary, or by executive order. we would have pushed through the direct taxes code, which i think is absolutely necessary and overdue by at least 10 or 15 years. we would have passed the gst of course. and we would have taken up many of the fslrc recommendations and where it required laws, we would have made the laws. at least the regulatory framework for the financial sector would have been completely redone if i had 282 or 330., , the pity was that none of the truly reforming governments in the last 30 years, had an absolute majority in the lok sabha. and when you have that majority, the present government is not using it to bring about bold, structural reforms and institutional reforms., , q: you had said that post the bihar election verdict, there might be a course correction in the government’s approach., , a. i was wrong. on the contrary, post bihar, if you look at the way they are reacting to the hyderabad university incident and the jnu incident, they seem to have stiffened their backs and decided to go the way of chest-thumping and muscle-flexing nationals., , q: yesterday, some ministers talked of how maoist movement infiltrates the dsu and they are using that excuse to crack down on jnu?, , a. it’s possible that there are some students whose sympathies lie with the maoist movement. but unless there is incitement of violence, it is not sedition. the slogan pakistan zindabad, etc is heard everyday in kashmir. the slogan for khalistan is heard almost every week in punjab. there were people in tamil nadu who sing the praises of the ltte and even glorify the ltte cadres who were behind the killing of rajiv gandhi. some of it is clearly unacceptable and punishable. but is it punishable as sedition? that is the distinction we are drawing. now which other law is attracted will depend on the nature of the provocation, the exact words that were uttered and the place and time and context in which they were uttered. any lawyer familiar with the law laid down in this behalf will know that this is not sedition. and even today, i find that the police commissioner is defending the charge sheet against kanhaiya kumar on the ground of sedition. clearly, going through what kanhaiya kumar said on that day, it does not attract the law of sedition. in fact, i don’t think his speech attracts any law at all (laughs)., , , q: what is your advice to mr jaitley on the eve of the budget?, , a. well, the expenditure statement and the revenue book would have been printed. only the speech remains. i don’t think anything i say will find a way in his speech, so why say it? he is against quoting poets, he said so last time. i hope he changes his mind this time., , q: this is a government without poetry, unlike mr vajpayee’s government?, , a. (laughs) or humour, for that matter., , q: what would you have done with aadhaar, since you had reservations as home minister on the scheme?, , a. no, aadhar is necessary. the only debate at that time was which should be the agency that took it forward. should it be the uid authority or the registrar general of india? then it was agreed that both would carry on in different areas. ultimately, it is the rgi which has to do the mop-up and bring everybody who’s left out, into aadhaar. and it is the rgi’s work that has a certain finality. otherwise, upa was very clear that aadhaar has to be progressively expanded to cover all indians and it should become if not the sole, at least the primary instrument of identity., , q: on the gst bill, are you expecting a change of stance?, , a. for a change of stance, you must ask the government., , q: the government is saying the cap on the rate cannot be put in the constitutional bill?, , a. that’s wrong. of course, capping the rate on the bill can be done. what is the problem with that? mr jaitley’s bill, in one section, mentions the rate one per cent. so why can’t the constitutional amendment bill mention a rate? his own bill mentions a rate., , secondly, the profession tax provision of the constitution – article 276 – contains a cap of rs 2,500. that number is mentioned in the constitution. so mentioning a cap in the constitution is not unprecedented., , q: towards the end of upa’s second innings, you set up the project monitoring group in the cabinet secretariat that managed to secure clearances for stalled investment projects worth rs 6.5 lakh crore. but under this government…, , a. mr anil swarup continued to head it for some months. when he moved to the ministry of coal, the clout that pmg carried was lost. there is a dire need for putting in place a semi-permanent mechanism, if not a permanent mechanism, to get stalled or stranded projects off the ground. there are still over 250 projects that are still stranded for one reason or another. and until we clear the last of them, it is still necessary to have a mechanism., , q: you mentioned that an over-centralised governance style leads to people withdrawing and not taking initiative. do you think this could lead to a form of policy paralysis that is probably worse than was seen in upa’s last years?, , a. i don’t think there was any policy paralysis in the upa government. what happened was the whole atmosphere became so full of acrimony because of the corruption charges arising out of the 2g and coal allocations. everybody was living under a sense of fear. but at the policy level, decisions were being taken., , in the present government, the real reason why you get a feeling of stasis – everything has come to a standstill – is because of over-centralisation. in a country as large as this and in a complex exercise as the government of india, once you over-centralise decision making, everybody simply ceases to act. they just fold their hands and wait for the decision to be handed down., , q: there seems to be a larger unity in the opposition now and the congress party seems to be veering extremely close to the left., , a. i am not surprised. that is because the left has modified its view of the congress party. congress party must always look to the left, must always lean for the poor. and if you find an ally on the left, why not ally with them?, ",0.04726060910920065,' increasing polarisation become theme modi government ',"former union minister home finance , p. chidambaram active player much india ’ public life last three decades. eve launching book columns completing year opposition , called standing guard ( rupa publications ) , speaks nistula hebbar vikas dhoot nationalism , sedition would done absolute majority parliament … . , , q : book year opposition ten years office? , , a.

2016-03-02,emptying the idea of india,"the current strategy of the bharatiya janata party (bjp) is to mount relentless rhetorical attacks on the “anti” in anti-national while leaving the “nation” in national carefully empty. it was showcased in parliament by human resource development >minister smriti irani in her enactment of what a popular film song once referred to as “emosanal atyachar”. but when she said, “i am not certifying your idea of india but do not demean mine”, ms. irani was being unduly modest because she was actually doing much more than “not certifying” the idea of india — she was evacuating it. juxtaposed against the silent emptiness of this idea was the eloquent fullness of her righteous rage against those who would demean it. this clever tactic captured the moral high ground by framing the motion to be debated as “insults to the nation cannot be tolerated”, thus trapping opponents in defensive positions on the swampy terrain of insults by denying them a foothold on any firm conception of the nation. but the ploy worked only as long as the idea of india was left undefined. she was under fire the moment she tried to label mahishasura worship as anti-national, because this defined the nation as exclusively limited to durga worshippers, a specific definition that was immediately challenged., emotion over reasondespite being an intangible idea, the nation is quite real because it is a shared idea. symbols of nationhood are important for this sharing to be reliably reproduced, which is why we have familiar aids to memory like maps, flags, or the figure of mother india. national symbols are extremely powerful because they connect to compressed reservoirs of intense emotion., that is why publicly invoking these symbols has to be an act of responsible citizenship and not self-serving demagoguery, but the difference can be hard to tell. the problem with emotive symbols is that though they can multiply the force of arguments, they cannot replace the arguments themselves. all persuasion harnesses symbols but principled persuasion must also provide arguments that can be rationally debated., the bjp strategy is a cynical ploy to maximise the emotive impact of symbols while refusing reasoned argument. it is cynical in its unfair fixation on a real or imagined “anti” without allowing the accused the space to speak of the conception of nation that informs the allegedly “anti-national” act. the shameless resort to a partisan use of state power to terrorise, silence and break opponents makes this cynicism dangerous. how else can one explain why lawyers who repeatedly indulged in violent assaults on court premises, or journalists who wantonly incited violence based on fake evidence are not in jail — but kanhaiya kumar, umar khalid and anirban bhattacharya are?, to be fair, during the past two decades the nation idea has been under siege globally, and not only in india. when it first came into its own in the nineteenth century, the nation seemed to define a common boundary for cultural belonging, economic interdependence, and political accountability. in the era of globalisation, the cultural, economic and political dimensions of the nation have diverged, thus undermining the sovereignty of the idea itself. in india, these processes began to take effect from the 1980s, long before the dominance of the bjp., weapon of mass distractionagainst this background, narendra modi’s election campaign emphasised inclusive development — sabka saath, sabka vikas — with hindutva as a side show. unfortunately, until now the modi regime has been unable to deliver on virtually all of its promises on the economic front — it remains to be seen whether the 2016 budget will effect a welcome change of direction. the sudden deepening of inequalities has fuelled frustrations among the very groups that were its most enthusiastic supporters, such as patidars, jats or the urban middle classes., historically, regimes unable to provide bread have had to stage circuses of one kind or another to retain their credibility. these have taken the form of highly publicised programmes and campaigns with little or no real content, like swachh bharat abhiyan or beti bachao beti padhao. because of these economic setbacks, the cultural front has had to bear a heavier burden. there has been a marked escalation in communal tensions, with various “fringe” outfits and individuals taking on a central role. the characteristic form of these events is a claimed insult to hindu sentiment or “indian culture”. why do these campaigns invariably take a negative form, from the attempts to convert valentine’s day into parents’ day or christmas into good governance day, through the beef ban, right up to the ayodhya ram mandir campaign? is it really impossible to become a good hindu today without opposing someone or something else?, the changing campusit is in this context that we need to place the quiet revolution in higher education that has taken place over the past two decades. today, in most non-technical institutions of higher learning women equal or exceed male students in numbers. after the 93rd constitutional amendment extended reservations, the caste (and class) composition of elite universities has been transformed. while muslims remain under-represented, most others have gained access, making our universities the only public spaces in contemporary india where almost all groups (barring the poorest) can meet and mingle in a relatively egalitarian setting. this newly democratised site is proving to be a massive source of anxiety and resentment for the current regime. campuses like those of the university of hyderabad or jawaharlal nehru university are seen as particularly dangerous because they are spaces where dalits are not only assertive but are making common cause with other marginalised groups including muslims., hence the vicious campaign against radical students and campuses, and the relentless repetition of the charge of being “anti-national”. the bitter irony here is that while the accused have been describing the india — and, as with rohith vemula, the world — that they stand for in passionate detail, the accusers have offered only the thinnest and emptiest of descriptions. nothing illustrates this better than the bizarre proposal to hoist gigantic national flags in universities. even more telling is the plan to showcase tanks and artillery on campuses in the hope that they will exude patriotism and provide immunity against the dreaded disease of critical thinking., whether it is sent intentionally or subconsciously, the message is sinister. the university and the army are at opposite ends of the state apparatus, one representing the nation’s desire to nurture critical perspectives and innovative thinking that will strengthen its ability to respond to change, the other representing the might of the state to be deployed after all hope of peaceful resolution is lost. by invoking the arm of the state that is the last resort of brute force in defence of the nation, is the government implying that it thinks of universities as enemy territory that must be conquered by force?",0.032736452535559686,emptying idea india,"current strategy bharatiya janata party ( bjp ) mount relentless rhetorical attacks “anti ” anti-national leaving “nation ” national carefully empty. showcased parliament human resource development >minister smriti irani enactment popular film song referred “emosanal atyachar ” . said , “i certifying idea india demean mine ” , ms. irani unduly modest actually much “not certifying ” idea india — evacuating it. juxtaposed silent emptiness idea eloquent fullness righteous rage would demean it. clever tactic captured moral high ground framing motion debated “insults nation cannot tolerated ” , thus trapping opponents defensive positions swampy terrain insults denying foothold firm conception nation. ploy worked long idea india left undefined. fire moment tried label mahishasura worship anti-national , defined nation exclusively limited durga worshippers , specific definition immediately challenged. , emotion reasondespite intangible idea , nation quite real shared idea. symbols nationhood important sharing reliably reproduced , familiar aids memory like maps , flags , figure mother india. national symbols extremely powerful connect compressed reservoirs intense emotion. , publicly invoking symbols act responsible citizenship self-serving demagoguery , difference hard tell. problem emotive symbols though multiply force arguments , cannot replace arguments themselves. persuasion harnesses symbols principled persuasion must also provide arguments rationally debated. , bjp strategy cynical ploy maximise emotive impact symbols refusing reasoned argument. cynical unfair fixation real imagined “anti ” without allowing accused space speak conception nation informs allegedly “anti-national ” act. shameless resort partisan use state power terrorise , silence break opponents makes cynicism dangerous. else one explain lawyers repeatedly indulged violent assaults court premises , journalists wantonly incited violence based fake evidence jail — kanhaiya kumar , umar khalid anirban bhattacharya are?

2016-03-07,labour ministry to give housing subsidies to workers using aadhaar,"even as the aadhaar bill is to be passed in the lok sabha, the government has begun approving new subsidies to be delivered using the biometrics-backed unique identification or uid number.‎, labour minister bandaru dattatreya has approved a scheme to offer higher housing subsidies to 75 lakh beedi workers and miners working in non-coal mines using aadhaar, senior government officials said. however, the uid authority of india or uidai would find it difficult to capture their fingerprints owing to the nature of their work‎, according to its own biometric authentication standards., the minister approved the proposal on thursday, the same day that finance minister arun jaitley tabled the aadhaar (target delivery of financial and other subsidies, benefits and services) bill, 2016 in lok sabha. the bill, tabled as a money bill (not required rajya sabha’s approval) is aimed to give legal backing for transferring all government subsidies using aadhaar., “the labour minister has approved a dynamic and revolutionary scheme in which housing subsidy will be given through aadhaar so that subsidy reaches the targeted beneficiary,” said a senior ministry official., under the revised integrated housing scheme of 2016, the labour ministry will give rs 1.5 lakh as subsidy through direct benefit transfer, up from rs 40,000 at present, to beedi and non-mine workers to build a house on their own land. the house will have earthquake-resistance structure, two rooms, kitchen, bathroom and closet area for drying clothes., the move comes despite the unique identification authority of india (uidai) itself suggesting construction and mining workers be put in list of exceptions to whom the aadhaar system may not apply., in a detailed document titled ‘aadhaar authentication framework’, the uidai had said that people doing hard manual labour such as construction workers or mining workers may be treated as “exceptions” in the aadhaar system as they have “all of their fingers in extremely poor condition with respect to fingerprint quality.”, “there will always be a set of population who will be temporarily or permanently excluded from a specific biometric system. we can term this set of people as ‘outliers’,” the uidai said, adding that in such cases, alternate biometrics could be used such as the use of iris scan., “direct transfer mechanism has a lot of benefits. it is true that the government may find it difficult to implement it in the initial stages but it is the appropriate long-term solution to target the beneficiaries accurately,” said alakh n sharma, professor and director at delhi-based institute for human development., housing scheme for workers, the new housing scheme of the labour ministry will give assistance to workers having their own land with carpet area (the part enclosed within the wall) of at least 30 square meters. the subsidy amount will be released in three installments: first amount of rs 37,500 will be given as advance, second rs 90,000 after the construction of house reaches lintel level and third installment of rs 22,500 after completion of construction work. the worker can give additional contribution at his or her own will., also, for the first time, the government may give rs 1.5 lakh as an upfront amount to those workers who want to secure a bank loan to build house., “the subsidy amount of rs 1.5 lakh could be used as margin money to help them secure bank loans for building a house. also, the new housing scheme will become a part of prime minister’s ‘housing for all’ project,” the labour ministry official said. in 2014-15, the government constructed 16,552 houses for beedi and non-coal mine

2016-03-15,the aadhaar coup,"the aadhaar project was sold to the public> based on the claim that enrolment was “voluntary”. this basically meant that there was no legal compulsion to enrol. the government and the unique identification authority of india (uidai), however, worked overtime to create a practical compulsion to enrol: >aadhaar was made mandatory for an ever-widening range of facilities and services. it became clear that life without aadhaar would soon be very difficult. in these circumstances, saying that aadhaar is voluntary is like saying that breathing or eating is voluntary. legal or practical, compulsion is compulsion., sweeping powers it took the supreme court to put an end to this doublespeak. in march 2014, the court ruled that “no person shall be deprived of any service for want of aadhaar number in case he/she is otherwise eligible/entitled”. this was a very sensible interpretation of what it would really mean for aadhaar to be voluntary. throughout the proceedings, incidentally, the central government stood by the claim that aadhaar was a voluntary facility. the supreme court did nothing more than to clarify the implications of that claim., it is important to note that aadhaar could work wonders as a voluntary facility. a certified, verifiable, all-purpose identity card would be a valuable document for many people. but the uidai has never shown much interest in the aadhaar card, or in developing voluntary applications of aadhaar. instead, it has relentlessly pushed for aadhaar being used as a mandatory identification number in multiple contexts, and for biometric authentication with a centralised database over the internet. that is a very different ball game., the supreme court order caused consternation in official circles, since it ruled out most of the planned applications of aadhaar. the >aadhaar bill, tabled last week as a money bill in the lok sabha and passed by it, is the central government’s counter-attack. under section 7, the bill gives the government sweeping powers to make aadhaar mandatory for a wide range of facilities and services. further, section 57 enables the government to impose aadhaar identification in virtually any other context, subject to the same safeguards as those applying to section 7., in concrete terms, >the bill allows the government to make aadhaar authentication compulsory for salary payments, old-age pensions, school enrolment, train bookings, marriage certificates, getting a driving licence, buying a sim card, using a cybercafé — virtually anything. judging from the experience of the last few years, the government will exercise these powers with abandon and extend aadhaar’s grip to ever more imaginative domains. indeed, aadhaar was always intended to be “ubiquitous”, as nandan nilekani, former chairman of the uidai, himself puts it., >also read: nine issues to debate on the aadhaar bill, mass surveillance why is this problematic? various concerns have been raised, from the unreliability of biometrics to possible breaches of confidentiality. but> the main danger is that aadhaar opens the door to mass surveillance. most of the “aadhaar-enabled” databases will be accessible to the government even without invoking the special powers available under the bill, such as the blanket “national security” clause. it will be child’s play for intelligence agencies to track anyone and everyone — where we live, when we move, which events we attend, whom we marry or meet or talk to on the phone. no other country, and certainly no democratic country, has ever held its own citizens hostage to such a powerful infrastructure of surveillance., if this sounds like paranoia, think again. total surveillance is the dream of intelligence agencies, as we know from edward snowden and other insiders. the indian government’s own inclination to watch and control dissenters of all hues has been amply demonstrated in recent years. for every person who is targeted or harassed, one thousand fall into line. the right to privacy is an essential foundation of the freedom to dissent., mass surveillance threatens to halt the historic expansion of civil liberties and personal freedom. for centuries, ordinary people have lived under the tyranny of oppressive governments. compulsion, arrests, executions, torture were the accepted means of ensuring their submission to authority. it took long and harsh struggles to win the freedoms that we enjoy and take for granted today — the freedom to move about as we wish, associate with whoever we like, speak up without fear. no doubt these freedoms are still elusive for large sections of the populations, especially dalits and those who live under the boot of the security forces. but that is a case for expansion, not restriction, of the freedoms we already have., the aadhaar bill asks us to forget these historic struggles and repose our faith in the benevolence of the government. of course, there is no immediate danger of democracy being subverted or civil liberties being suspended. only an innocent, however, would fail to anticipate aadhaar being used as a tool of mass surveillance. and mass surveillance per se is an infringement of democracy and civil liberties, even if the government does not act on it. as glenn greenwald aptly puts it in his book no place to hide, “history shows that the mere existence of a mass surveillance apparatus, regardless of how it is used, is in itself sufficient to stifle dissent.”, >also read: 10 instances when the government said you needed an aadhaar, uncertain benefits the champions of the aadhaar bill downplay these concerns for the sake of enabling the government to save some money. wild claims are being made about aadhaar’s power to plug leakages. in reality, aadhaar can only help to plug specific types of leakages, such as those related to duplication in beneficiary lists. it will be virtually useless to plug leakages in, say, the public distribution system (pds), which have little to do with identity fraud. on the other hand, recent experience has shown that aadhaar could easily play havoc with the pds. wherever aadhaar authentication has been imposed on the pds, there have been complaints of delays, authentication failures, connectivity problems, and more. the poorer states, where the pds is most needed, are least prepared for this sort of technology. there are better ways of reforming the pds. similar remarks apply to the mahatma gandhi national rural employment guarantee scheme (mgnregs)., i have seen some of this damage at close range in jharkhand, where aadhaar was supposed to prove its mettle. aadhaar applications (in the pds, mgnregs, and even the banking system) have had poor results in jharkhand, and caused much disruption. for instance, mgnregs functionaries have cancelled job cards on a large scale for the sake of achieving “100 per cent aadhaar seeding” of the job-cards database. mgnregs workers have been offloaded by rural banks on aadhaar-enabled “business correspondents” who proved unable to pay them due to poor connectivity. and the proposed imposition of biometric authentication

2016-04-12,clearing the smoke on lpg reform,"overcoming pitfalls: “the distribution system needs to be strengthened to be able to meet the expected increase in demand, particularly in rural areas, as non-availability of fuel could push people back towards using solid fuels.” a scene at jarugumalai, tamil nadu. — photo: e. lakshmi narayanan | photo credit: e_lakshmi narayanan , one of the less discussed but potentially far-reaching features of this year’s budget was the launch of the >pradhan mantri ujjwala yojana (pmuy). the rs.8,000-crore scheme aims to provide subsidised liquefied petroleum gas (lpg) connections to about 60 per cent of below poverty line (bpl) households — roughly as many households as there are in germany — by 2019. the idea itself is not new as subsidised connections to >bpl households have been provided under various schemes even earlier. however, the scale of this programme is what sets it apart. until 2013, 75 lakh predominantly rural, subsidised bpl connections were disbursed under various schemes. fifty-five lakh subsidised bpl connections are claimed to have been provided in the last year under the “give back” scheme linked to the “give it up” campaign. in comparison, the pmuy aims to provide subsidised connections to five crore households in three years., fuel use and health, about 75 crore indians, especially women and girls, are exposed to severe household air pollution (hap) from the use of solid fuels such as biomass, dung cakes and coal for cooking. a report from the ministry of health & family welfare places hap as the second leading risk factor contributing to india’s disease burden. in comparison, poor sanitation, which has received much-needed attention of late, ranks 15th. according to the world health organization, solid fuel use is responsible for about 13 per cent of all mortality and morbidity in india (measured as disability-adjusted life years), and causes about 40 per cent of all pulmonary disorders, nearly 30 per cent of cataract incidences, and over 20 per cent each of ischemic heart disease, lung cancer and lower respiratory infection. thus, the pmuy is a very welcome initiative. however, the real test of the pmuy and its successor programmes will be in how they translate the provision of connections to sustained use of lpg or other clean fuels such as electricity or biogas. to pass this test, a few more issues need to be addressed., cost and distribution first, cooking fuel should be available at an affordable cost to back up the initial provision of subsidised connections. each bpl household would have to spend up to rs.5,000 each year on lpg even at current subsidised prices — in addition to a one-time cost of rs.1,800 for the connection — which may be unaffordable to many. the pmuy has proposed payment in instalments for stoves and cylinders to address this challenge, which is welcome. in addition, it may consider increasing >lpg subsidies for the first few cylinders bought in a year by bpl households. with the success of the “give it up” campaign and the proposal to proactively exclude all those earning above rs.10 lakh per annum from lpg subsidies, the burden on the exchequer for the increased subsidies to bpl households may be minimal, particularly in comparison to the huge health and economic benefits that come with it., second, the distribution system needs to be strengthened to be able to meet the expected increase in demand, particularly in rural areas, as non-availability of fuel could push people back towards using solid fuels. ensuring reliable, sustained, last-mile supply would require multiple steps. it requires a large extension of distribution networks, especially in rural areas, since each rural distribution agency typically caters to fewer customers than urban agencies. reports that many jan-dhan accounts have zero balance raise concerns about whether subsidy transfer to such accounts will work effectively; so, implementation of direct benefit transfer schemes must be made more robust. effective monitoring and grievance redressal systems are equally important to ensure that problems in the scheme are highlighted and addressed early. the scheme should be accompanied by a focussed public relations campaign, similar to the national tuberculosis or swachh bharat campaigns, to build awareness and create a “demand pull”, not only for clean cooking but also for good service. ensuring reliable supply is also likely to require strengthening the refining, bottling and pipeline infrastructure. in the absence of such supporting measures, the pmuy runs the risk of failing like the >rajiv gandhi grameen vidyutikaran yojana, which succeeded in extending physical electricity infrastructure at great cost but has not been able to ensure a reliable supply of affordable electricity to households.",0.13878552003552005,clearing smoke lpg reform,"overcoming pitfalls : “the distribution system needs strengthened able meet expected increase demand , particularly rural areas , non-availability fuel could push people back towards using solid fuels. ” scene jarugumalai , tamil nadu. — photo : e. lakshmi narayanan &#124;

sadly, our political scientist who speaks like a prophet of the old testament — all thunder, fire and brimstone — does not raise his voice against the injustice that cadres of his beloved rashtriya swayamsevak sangh wreak on hapless people., nor does he bother to listen to the voice of the political community that elected him to power. i wish for once, just once, he would stop lecturing us, exactly the way a school teacher speaks down to recalcitrant school children, and heed what citizens of india want, desire, and aspire for. democracy recognises that ordinary people possess political competence and are entitled to participate in policy discussions. they have a right to be heard and to hold their representatives to account for acts of omission and commission. that is why democracy is worthwhile. but a complete non-understanding of the value of democracy by the present leadership has led to dire impoverishment of our political discourse., consider, for instance, the ironies of the >swachch bharat campaign. i am perfectly aware of the virtues of sanitation. but is the manner in which the campaign has been conceptualised and put into practice up to the mark? the insincerity of the entire campaign was wonderfully captured in a photograph of hema malini advertising for swachch bharat. saree tucked in, she wields with considerable inexperience a long broom, even as ten security guards who cluster around her watch., perhaps the fault lies not in the leaders we have got, but in us. the 2014 elections were an indication of the summer of our disgruntlement. disenchantment with petty party politics, major corruption, and non-delivery on promises generated great hope: that a man riding a white horse and brandishing a swirling sword will come thundering in and solve all our problems. if in the process our party system and democracy are wiped out, so be it. we forget that the problems of society need collective understanding and action. above all, these problems can be resolved only when people who aspire to power understand the complexity that is india.",0.05269075894075895,dumbing indian politics,"today ' leaders : “instead visionary statesmen , showmen business self-promotion. ” file photo bjp poster new delhi assembly elections , bus stop capital. photo : sushil kumar verma , ruling dispensation draws heavily upon symbols rituals hinduism justify authority. leaders brand politics seem conversant discourses statecraft brahmanical texts ancient india. consider santi parva , twelfth episode mahabharata , patriarch bhishma tutors dithering monarch hastinapur , yudhishthira , responsibilities ruler. wending leisurely way intellectual thickets statecraft , geography , metaphysics , cosmos , mythology , genealogy , history , sankya yoga philosophy , bhishma finally speaks obligations ruler. , first obligation ruler ensure prabhavaya , prosperity subjects. second dharna , holding together human beings. righteous ruler must draw arbitrary boundaries ‘belong ’ not. third obligation non-violence. rules raj dharma thus place limits power. , emphasis dharna?

2016-05-23,"taking stock, two years on","llustration: satwik gade , in broad terms, two features distinguish social sector strategy of prime minister narendra modi. first, it endeavours to make the existing programs more efficient by cutting leakages. and second, it gives priority to empowerment over entitlement., early in its tenure, the government achieved a major success in financial inclusion with empowerment through prime >minister’s jana dhana yojana. this scheme proposed to give a bank account to every family. the program entered the guinness book of records for opening 1.8 crore accounts in one week from 23 to 29 august 2014. by may 2016, the scheme had opened 21.74 crore accounts with rs. 37,445 crore in deposits., alongside, the prime minister not only took the pragmatic decision of retaining and rapidly expanding the aadhaar biometric identification program but also accelerated its deployment for cutting wasteful expenditure in the delivery of social programs. recently, legislation has been passed that empowers the government to require the beneficiary of services financed from the consolidated fund of india to provide her aadhaar identity number. in turn, the government can link the beneficiary’s aadhaar identity number and bank account to which benefits are transferred. this direct benefit transfer (dbt) instrumentality complemented by aadhaar seeding of the bank account eliminates the possibility of benefits accruing to multiple accounts of the same beneficiary or to ghost accounts., large social programs such as the public distribution system (pds), mahatma gandhi national rural employment guarantee act (>mgnrega) and subsidized sales of fertilizer and liquid petroleum gas (lpg) cylinders have been subject to massive leakages through the use of multiple and ghost accounts. these leakages can now be plugged via dbt cum aadhaar instrumentality. the government has already successfully done this in the disbursement of the subsidy associated with the pds, mgnrega and lpg cylinders though the coverage remains far from complete. not all bank accounts have been linked to aadhaar., to-date, an estimated 3.5 crore multiple or ghost beneficiaries have been eliminated from the lpg rolls. during 2014-15 alone, this resulted in savings of rs. 14,672 crore. in mgnrega, similar weeding out of multiple or ghost beneficiaries resulted in a savings of rs. 3,000 crore in 2015-16. this amount is a little below 10% of the total mgnrega allocation. in pds, an estimated rs. 10,000 crore has been saved by elimination of 1.6 crore fake ration cards >using the aadhaar instrumentality., to empower rural households, the government has greatly accelerated the process of rural electrification and rural-road construction. during its two years in office, the government has brought electricity to 7,654 villages compared with 5,189 villages in the preceding three years. likewise, total rural road length constructed has been 36,340 and 36,450 kilometres during 2014-15 and 2015-16, respectively. in comparison, only 24,160 and 25,320 kilometres had been constructed during 2012-13 and 2013-14, respectively., approximately 12 crore households in india continue to use solid biomass fuels for cooking, with its attendant harmful effects on health. to-date, no serious effort has been made to free up these households of the black carbon they inhale while cooking. for years, efficient cook stoves have been promoted but they cover less than 1% of the affected families to-date., for the first time, the government has resolved to bring lpg cylinders to these households. the government has launched >pradhan mantri ujjawal yojana under which 5 crore bpl below poverty line households will be provided subsidized lpg cylinders over the next three years. the target for the current fiscal year is 1.5 crore households. the scheme is being financed in part from the savings generated through voluntary surrender of lpg subsidy by existing richer households. at prime minister’s call, one crore richer households have already given up this subsidy., in the budget 2015-16, the government launched atal pension scheme to provide a minimal insurance cover to workers in unorganized sector. under the scheme, the central government co-contributes the lower of 50% of the total contribution and rs. 1,000 per annum to each subscriber account for a period of 5 years. depending on his contribution, a subscriber under the age of 40 receives the fixed monthly pension of rs. 1000 to rs 5000 at the age of 60 years., in parallel, the central government has introduced >pradhan mantri suraksha bima yojana (insurance against accidental death) and jeevan jyoti bima yojana (insurance against death). the former provides cover for rs. 2 lakh in case of death and rs. 1 lakh in case of partial disability to individuals 18 to 70 years of age for a premium of rs. 12 per annum. the latter covers individuals between 18 and 50 years for rs. 2 lakh at a premium of rs. 330 per year. by 9 may 2016, 9.4 crore beneficiaries had enrolled under the suraksha bima yojana and 3 crore under the jeevan jyoti scheme. enrolment in atal pension yojana at 20 lakh was significantly lower., the budget 2016-17 announced three major initiatives related to health: insurance, >jan aushadhi scheme and dialysis programme. under the health insurance scheme, coverage for rs. 1 lakh is provided against hospitalization expenditure. for senior citizens, there is additional coverage of rs. 30,000. the government will cover eight crore families from economically weaker section free of charge through an aadhaar-linked programme. under jan aushadhi programme, the government will open 3,000 stores nationwide to provide low-cost generic drugs. with 2.2 lakh end stage renal disease patients added each year, the government has also announced a programme to provide dialysis services in all district hospitals., the government has introduced several measures towards improved implementation of mgnrega. it has given priority to low-hanging fruits such as water ponds and de-silting of water ponds in asset creation. it has also taken a more liberal approach towards building of private assets such as houses, wells and toilets for the poor. this has created ownership of assets by respective beneficiaries and led to better supervision of work. finally, the government has improved the convergence between mgnrega works and schemes such as skill development, prime minister’s krishi sinchai yojana, housing for all and >swachh bharat mission., in the area of higher education, regulations have been liberalized to give greater flexibility to women to complete their m. phil and ph.d. degrees. upon fulfilling certain conditions, women ph.d. scholars relocating to other towns can now transfer to a university in the destination town rather than having to begin afresh. rules have also been

2016-06-30,panchayati raj ministry: a downgrade for democracy,"if, as >the hindu’s >exclusive on wednesday indicates, prime minister narendra modi were to close down the ministry of panchayati raj, it would confirm one’s worst fears about his government’s hypocritical approach to grass-roots democracy for grass-roots development., this was a lacuna that was evident in the ‘gujarat model’ of development long before it began being inflicted from the centre. for mr. modi was just about the only chief minister to refuse me entry to the state when, as the first ever union minister for the subject during upa-i, i was attempting to round off my visits to all states and union territories to propagate the cause and work with state governments on state-specific action to be undertaken., a de-democratising move among other initiatives we took for strengthening panchayat empowerment was the index of devolution prepared by independent experts and geared towards rewarding states that over the previous year had made the most incremental progress towards more effective devolution in terms of the constitution and their own state legislation. many states that had been slow starters, including bihar, tripura, chhattisgarh, haryana, and rajasthan, found their scores rising and were appropriately recognised. gujarat never figured because its pattern was frozen., worse, gujarat ran a system under which democracy at the village level was discouraged by financially incentivising panchayats elected without contest. rajasthan, and now haryana, have followed suit by placing regressive restrictions on less educated and poorer candidates, particularly dalit women, from even contesting panchayat elections., this de-democratisation of local self-government will be aggravated if a cabinet minister for panchayati raj is not available to advocate and promote the cause with chief ministers and his counterparts in the states. after all, the 73rd amendment, now incorporated as part ix of the constitution, is the joint responsibility of the union and the states, calling for high-level coordination to promote and protect the provisions of the longest and most detailed amendment ever carried out to the constitution. it was passed virtually unanimously in december 1992 as representing the consensus among central and state stakeholders. this consensual method must be persisted with by bringing state ministers together; convening academic experts and field-level ngos; promoting feedback from and best practices among elected panchayat representatives; monitoring the special interests of women representatives, dalits and tribals; maintaining and updating data-banks on all aspects of panchayat raj; commissioning expert studies and preparing periodic reports such as the biannual state of the panchayats reports. these are among the key activities undertaken by the ministry. providing such an all-india perspective will be seriously diluted or even entirely lost without an independent ministry for the subject., the constitutional mandate moreover, merging or subordinating panchayat raj under rural development amounts to a grossly inadequate reading of the constitution, in particular the eleventh schedule that lists the proposed jurisdiction (“powers, authority and responsibilities”) of national-level panchayati raj. while schemes of the rural development ministry, like the mahatma gandhi national rural employment guarantee scheme, rural housing, national rural livelihoods mission and the pradhan mantri gram sadak yojana, are indeed covered under more than one entry in the eleventh schedule, the range of entries covers virtually the entire gamut of development and welfare in rural india, beginning with entry 1, “agriculture, including agricultural extension”, as also “animal husbandry, dairying and poultry” (entry 4) and “fisheries” (entry 5) that are the responsibility of the agriculture ministry; “minor irrigation, water management and watershed development” (entry 3) that falls under the ministry of water resources; “social forestry and farm forestry” (entry 6) and “minor forest produce” (entry 7) that jointly concern the ministry of environment, forest and climate change and the ministry of tribal affairs. drinking water (entry 11) and sanitation (entry 23), including the much-hyped swachh bharat abhiyan, are the responsibility of the ministry of drinking water and sanitation. the eleventh schedule goes on to detail “small scale industries, including food processing industries” (entry 8) and “khadi, village and cottage industries” (entry 9), that fall respectively under the ministry of micro, small and medium enterprises, the ministry of food processing industries and the ministry of textiles., “family welfare” (entry 24) and “health, including hospitals, primary health centres and dispensaries” (entry 23) are part of the national rural health mission run by the ministry of health and family welfare; while the massive integrated child development services programme falls under “women and child development” (entry 25) that is run by the ministry of the same name. “education, including primary and secondary schools” (entry 17), “technical training and vocational education” (entry 18), “adult and non-formal education” (entry 19) and libraries (entry 20) belong to the domain of the human resource development ministry, especially the transformative sarva shiksha abhiyan, and the ministry of skill development and entrepreneurship, while “cultural activities” (entry 21) are part of the ministry of culture. “social welfare” (entry 26), “the welfare of the weaker sections, and, in particular, of the scheduled castes and the scheduled tribes” is in the jurisdiction of the ministry of social welfare and the ministry of tribal affairs. “public distribution system” (entry 28) belongs to the ministry of food and public distribution. this listing is illustrative rather than comprehensive., with such a wide constitutional remit, confining panchayati raj to just the ministry of rural development will be a conceptual infringement, an emasculation of the constitutional role envisaged for panchayati raj institutions. what the 73rd amendment sought to do was a radical reorganisation of last-mile delivery of public goods and services to the panchayats by devolving “such powers and authority as may be necessary to enable them to function as institutions of self-government” (article 243g). note, “self-government” not “self-governance”: the fundamental mandate was to establish the panchayati raj system as the third tier of government, not to make these institutions implementing agencies for state departments or union ministries. this was to be achieved by endowing these “institutions of self-government” with the required functions, finances and functionaries (the three fs)., twenty-five years of progress clearly such a revolution in political relations between elected local government authorities and the state political set-up requires time and patient experimentation to play out. the ministry of panchayati raj, set up by upa-i in 2004, has over the past 12 years or so been advocating and incentivising this. it is the primary duty of the ministry to perform these delicate advisory functions. panchayati raj remains on the state list but, in view of the 73rd constitutional amendment, the centre becomes responsible to work with the states to fulfil in letter and spirit the aims and objects of the constitutional legislation. for this revolutionary task, an independent ministry, preferably under a persuasive and influential minister, is essential. otherwise panchayati raj will wither on the vine., prime among these is “activity mapping”, that is, identifying the numerous tasks to be undertaken in planning and implementing any given scheme with a view to allocating these different activities to different tiers of the system from the central to the state government and the three separate levels of rural self-government: the village, the intermediary (taluka or block) and the district would have to be supplemented by parallel and simultaneous devolution to the appropriate tiers of finances and functionaries. to this end, the upa prime minister, through the cabinet secretary, issued directions in november 2004 and august 2013 to departmental secretaries of all ministries concerned to work on such “activity maps” for their respective centrally-sponsored schemes. this called for a systemic overhaul of district and sub-district level administration (and the politics of administering rural india) involving the effective empowerment of a whole new tribe of elected local representatives.",0.06262452824952827,panchayati raj ministry : downgrade democracy,", >the hindu ’ >exclusive wednesday indicates , prime minister narendra modi close ministry panchayati raj , would

2016-07-15,expanding the idea of india,"the constitution of india, the longest written constitution of the world, has envisaged a holistic approach towards civic life in a democratic polity. certain rights have been guaranteed within the constitution as fundamental rights. since human conduct cannot be confined to the realm of fundamental rights, the constitution has envisaged certain duties, which are correlated to the rights, and those duties have been described as fundamental duties., the framers of the constitution did not deem it appropriate to incorporate those duties in the text of the constitution when it was originally promulgated. however, the post-constitution civic life, for around a quarter century, did not portray a rosy picture, and therefore, it was thought fit to have a framework of duties in the constitution itself. it may sound paradoxical that the preparatory work for the introduction of fundamental duties by the swaran singh committee was done when the fundamental rights were under suspension during the emergency., >the full text of justice kurian joseph speech, the fundamental duties the following ten fundamental duties were introduced by the 42nd amendment act, 1976 — article 51-a: it shall be the duty of every citizen of india: to abide by the constitution and respect its ideals and institutions, the national flag and the national anthem; to cherish and follow the noble ideals which inspired our national struggle for freedom; to uphold and protect the sovereignty, unity and integrity of india; to defend the country and render national service when called upon to do so; to promote harmony and the spirit of common brotherhood amongst all people of india transcending religious, linguistic and regional or sectional diversities and to renounce practices derogatory to the dignity of women; to value and preserve the rich heritage of our composite culture; to protect and improve the natural environment including forests, lakes, rivers and wildlife and to have compassion for living creatures; to develop the scientific temper, humanism and the spirit of inquiry and reform; to safeguard public property and to abjure violence; to strive towards excellence in all spheres of individual and collective activity, so that the nation constantly rises to higher levels of endeavour and achievement. subsequently, another duty was added by the 86th constitutional amendment act of 2002: for a parent or guardian to provide opportunities for education of the child or ward between the age of six and fourteen., since then, the scope of fundamental rights under part iii of the constitution has seen significant expansion through judicial pronouncements; the right to free legal services to the poor, right to speedy trial and right to live in a clean and healthy environment are just a few examples. as a result, an imbalance has been created between the current set of fundamental rights and duties. here is an attempt to examine if a few additional fundamental duties in the constitution of this country could help in balancing out the rights of its citizens and further make them more responsible towards the country’s development., additional duties duty to vote: article 326 of the constitution read with section 62 of the representation of people’s act, 1951 confers the right to vote. however, quite often the question arises as to whether that right also implies an obligation. the voter turnout during the last general election amounted only to about 67 per cent. this voter apathy should be taken seriously and an attempt should be made to make voting a citizenship obligation., the state can take several steps to ensure that this duty to vote is made operational and effective. one method through which this may be achieved is by developing a system of incentives for voters and conversely disadvantages for those who abstain from performing their duty to vote. a very large section of people can be motivated to vote this way., duty to pay taxes: the tax gap (the revenue that a government is expected to receive as against the revenue it actually collects) continues to increase every year. the greatest indicator of this is the fact that the size of india’s shadow economy as a share of the gdp reached 24.3 per cent in the year 2012. research has found that tax evasion is a direct result of lack of trust among the people, in general, and the government, in particular. citizens must believe that their taxes are bound to be used for public good. the incorporation of the right to pay taxes as part of fundamental duties in the constitution will shift the onus onto the taxpayer to pay taxes rather than the tax department to collect them., duty to help accident victims: every 60 minutes, 16 persons die in traffic accidents in india. according to the law commission of india, at least 50 per cent of fatalities can be prevented if road accident victims receive medical attention within the critical first hour after the accident. the karnataka government’s decision to frame a ‘good samaritan law’ is a step in the right direction. with the increase in the number of accidents, it has become pertinent for india to recognise this duty as one owed by its citizens towards each other., duty to keep the premises clean: prime minister narendra modi’s swachh bharat mission has received tremendous support from people from all walks of life. the most effective mechanism to tackle uncleanliness is to sensitise people about this duty. therefore, it is imperative that a fundamental duty to this effect be added to the constitution., for a better society, duty to prevent civil wrongs: it is not enough that a citizen refrains from committing wrong; he has a duty to see that fellow citizens do not indulge in the commission of wrongs., duty to raise voice against injustice: today people seem to have stopped reacting to atrocities; they neither report crimes nor volunteer to testify in a court. the duties of a victim or a witness can be classified into two main categories, viz. duty to report a crime and duty to testify in court. the state must also on its part work to ensure that the fight to bring the offender to book does not become a kafkaesque nightmare for the victim or witness., duty to protect whistle-blowers: with the coming into force of the right to information act, 2005, every citizen has become a “potential whistle-blower”. while the state has a great deal of responsibility in providing for their protection through appropriate legislative instruments, the responsibility to protect torchbearers of transparency vests on each one of us., duty to support bona fide civil society movements: citizens have a moral duty to organise themselves or support citizen groups so that the gaps in governance left by the executive can be filled and the rights guaranteed by the constitution are made available to every citizen. therefore, it is proposed that there must be an addition to part iv-a of the constitution to that effect., reinvigorating civic responsibility: in the modern context, it has become increasingly important to instil a reinvigorated sense of civic responsibility among indian citizens. this can be achieved by adding new duties to the existing list of fundamental duties while also laying emphasis on the performance of the existing ones. the significance of fundamental duties is not diminished by the fact that there is no punishment prescribed for not following them. fundamental duties constitute the conscience of our constitution; they should be treated as constitutional values that must be propagated by all citizens.",0.18371727478870345,expanding idea india,"constitution india , longest written constitution world , envisaged holistic approach towards civic life democratic polity. certain rights guaranteed within constitution fundamental rights. since human conduct cannot confined realm fundamental rights , constitution envisaged certain duties , correlated rights , duties described fundamental duties. , framers constitution deem appropriate incorporate duties text constitution originally promulgated. however , post-constitution civic life , around quarter century , portray rosy picture , therefore , thought fit framework duties constitution itself. may sound paradoxical preparatory work introduction fundamental duties swaran singh committee done fundamental rights suspension emergency. , >the full text justice kurian joseph speech , fundamental duties following ten fundamental duties introduced 42nd amendment act , 1976 — article 51-a : shall duty every citizen india : abide constitution respect ideals institutions , national flag national anthem ;

2016-07-23,we need a nutrition mission,"the “global nutrition report 2016” once again demonstrates india’s slow overall progress in addressing chronic malnutrition, manifest in stunting (low weight for age), wasting (low weight for height), micronutrient deficiencies and over-weight. our track record in reducing the proportion of undernourished children over the past decade has been modest at best, and lags what other countries with comparable socio-economic indicators have achieved., in a ranking of countries from lowest to highest on stunting, india ranks 114 out of 132 countries, with the incidence of stunting at 38.7 per cent, compared with germany and chile at 1.3 per cent and 1.8 per cent, respectively. even bangladesh and nepal rank marginally higher than india. on wasting, india ranks 120 out of 130 countries, at 15.1 per cent, compared with australia and chile at number 1 and 2, with 0 per cent and 0.3 per cent, and south sudan at 130 with 22.7 per cent. on the prevalence of anaemia in women of reproductive age, india ranks 170 out of 185 countries at 48.1 per cent, compared with senegal which is the worst at 57.5 per cent and the u.s. which is the best at 11.9 per cent., breaking the cycle aggregate levels of undernutrition in india remain shockingly high, despite the impressive reduction in stunting in the last decade. the segments most at risk continue to be adolescent girls, women and children, and among them scheduled castes and tribes are the worst off, reflecting the insidious economic and sociocultural deprivation so prevalent in india. according to the most recent united nations population fund (unfpa) report, nearly 50 per cent of women in india are married before they turn 18, in violation of the law., the poor nutritional status of adolescent girls, combined with child marriage and multiple pregnancies even before becoming an adult, lead to another dismal fact, that 30 per cent of all children are born with low birth weight. so we add approximately seven million, potentially wasted and stunted, to our population every year! for india to be healthy and break the inter-generational cycle of malnutrition, we have to focus on the health, nutrition and social status of children, adolescent girls and women as a priority., undernutrition — both protein energy malnutrition and micronutrient deficiencies like iron deficiency anaemia — among nearly 70 per cent of school-going children challenges the capacity for physical growth and cognitive development., the past decade has seen a steady build-up of momentum around nutrition with the setting up of the sun (scaling up nutrition) secretariat in the un; the world health assembly adoption (in 2012) of the 2025 global targets for maternal, infant and young children’s nutrition, and the 2015 sustainable development goals which centre-stage the ending of all forms of malnutrition for all people by 2030, to name a few. india’s progress clearly lags behind what is needed to eliminate malnutrition by 2030., maharashtra was the first state in india to launch a nutrition mission, in 2005, followed by five other states, madhya pradesh, uttar pradesh, odisha, gujarat and karnataka, covering a total population of 300 million. in all six states the focus of the nutrition mission is inter-sectoral coordination to improve child nutrition in the first 1000 days., the problem and solution framework are correctly identified, but there are hardly any targets or financial commitments or concrete and specific programmes and processes to accomplish this goal. systemic development is a long process that requires continuity, consistency, excellence in execution and a measurement of process, output and outcome/impact metrics, and so far at least, much of this seems to be missing for converting intent to action., one of the reasons for persistent undernutrition in india, despite the creation of integrated child development services (icds) in 1975 and national coverage of the mid-day meal scheme in 1995, is that there is no structure for multi-sectoral coordination which is essential to address the inter-generational and multifaceted nature of malnutrition. the announcement therefore from the ministry of women and child development last week of plans to overhaul the icds is welcome and much needed., poor nutrition is poor economics, the need to systemically address underlying causes of malnutrition in india is an urgency that cannot be postponed for the following reasons: one, poor nutrition is poor economics. the world bank estimates that india loses 2-3 per cent of its annual gdp by way of lower productivity, the underlying cause of which is malnutrition., the ministry of finance in its economic survey 2015-16 says, “imagine the government were an investor trying to maximise india’s long-run economic growth. given constraints on fiscal space and the state’s capacity to deliver public services, where would it invest? this chapter argues that some of the highest economic returns to public investment in human capital in india lie in maternal and early-life health and nutrition interventions.”, the copenhagen consensus has identified twice several nutrition interventions as some of the most high-yielding of all possible development assessments., two, poor nutrition will fracture the dreams and aspirations of india to become a global player in manufacturing and other industries. the human dividend on which we are banking is actually a huge liability given that one out of every three children is born underweight and unable to realise the full potential for physical growth and cognitive development, leading to lower levels of productivity., three, poor nutrition is poor humanity. article 47 of the constitution mentions the “duty of the state to raise the level of nutrition and the standard of living and to improve public health. the state shall regard the raising of the level of nutrition and the standard of living of its people and the improvement of public health as among its primary duties.” we cannot have this broken promise nearly six decades after the constitution was written., harnessing positive factors, right now there is a confluence of positive factors that must be harnessed for impactful and positive transformation. several programmes already announced by the government like swachh bharat, ‘beti bachao, beti padao’, etc. are critical nutrition-sensitive factors that address hygiene, sanitation and education. for the nutrition-specific areas, india already has the infrastructure and mechanism for reaching people most at risk. these have to be urgently revamped and made more effective., the three structures that must be prioritised are: the icds, which caters to the needs of pregnant and nursing mothers and children under the age of six; the mid-day meal scheme, which directly feeds approximately 120 million schoolchildren every day; and the public distribution system, which makes available subsistence rations to above and below poverty line families. all three are also excellent platforms for public-private partnerships to improve the level and quality of service and could be considered as specific areas for collaboration in csr programmes., of these, the intent to revamp the icds has already been announced and must move into action mode quickly. this must include streamlining the work in the 1.34 million anganwadi centres by investing in training the 2.5 million workers and helpers at these centres, standardising the nutrition component of the supplementary food offered and focussing on the overall dissemination of information and education to pregnant and nursing mothers on healthy eating habits, hygiene and sanitation, etc., care india has recently created a “job aid” which is a piloted mobile application that helps anganwadi workers plan, schedule and better coordinate their work. this and other relevant applications must be disseminated quickly to enhance the productivity and effectiveness of the anganwadi workers., similarly, the mid-day meal is an excellent structure to reach 120 million children with continuity and regularity. a single intervention in that scheme to focus on nutrition in addition to food will make a critical difference. this can easily be accomplished by the addition of micronutrients to cooked food or by adding universally liked and accepted products such as milk, biscuits, etc. fortified with micronutrients as a mid-morning or afternoon snack., there is compelling evidence from around the world that large-scale food fortification is one of the best ways to address micronutrient deficiency. the standards of the cooked meal could be changed to using only fortified flour, fortified oil and iodised salt. a large number of children suffer from both insufficient calories and inadequate micronutrients. the most compelling argument for focussing on this group is that it is targeted, there is continuity and regularity and the impact of any intervention is measurable over a period of time., borrowing from best practice in countries that have made quick and significant progress in combating malnutrition, it is recommended that a nutrition mission be created to orchestrate and sequence the work both in nutrition-specific and nutrition-sensitive areas so that the impact from each of these is embedded in positive and productive outcomes. there is enough evidence from other countries, especially those which have adopted a multi-sectoral framework, that the results are tangible and specific., there are other proven interventions like large-scale food fortification (flour, oil, milk, etc. in addition to salt) that are inexpensive and effective and must be mandated into food standards., steps to change outcomes, the immediate actions to step change nutrition outcomes could be summarised as follows: one, create a nutrition secretariat as part of the prime minister’s office with responsibility for ensuring multi-sectoral alignment on priorities, sequencing and timelines. this would include both nutrition-specific and nutrition-sensitive initiatives. agree on a dashboard of nutrition metrics to be tracked, just as we track economic metrics., two, make the nodal ministries accountable for revamping the icds, mdm, pds with clear goals, timelines and resources. open these up for public-private partnerships and make these csr-eligible.",0.0927922077922078,need nutrition mission,"“global nutrition report 2016 ” demonstrates india ’

2016-07-24,"for a better mumbai, fix the slums first","a child walks through an alley in dharavi, asia's largest slum, in mumbai, india, wednesday, jan. 21, 2009. golden globes winning 'slumdog millionaire', a british-indian film about a mumbai slum boy's rise to game-show glory will be released in india in two languages on jan. 23. (ap photo/gautam singh) | photo credit: gautam singh , the government has plenty of schemes for slum redevelopment, but most of these are on paper. importantly, sanitation is not on the agenda., i was all of 17 when i migrated to mumbai in 1967 from kolar, karnataka. i didn’t have a purpose then; my only aim was to find bread. i often wondered why i moved to this city. when i look back, i can visualise how millions have the same problem: you don’t have anything, you look out for a metropolis, you land in mumbai., i would never have dreamt what bombay meant. it was a culture shock at various levels. to begin with, i’d never heard the word ‘slum.’ moreover, the language was alien, and we had open-air, ‘airconditioned’ toilets., a week after i landed in the city, i ended up in the thickly-populated janata colony, mankhurd. conditions were pathetic. if i needed to use the public toilet, i would have to queue for nearly 20 minutes. so i would end up squatting wherever i would find place., i was in a slum, but i had no home. in fact, i had zero liabilities and assets, no roof over my head, no roots. i would sleep anywhere., one of the good things about a slum is that no one ever chases you away from their doorstep. in the day, i would mark out a veranda where i could lay my head at night. i would pick up saris hung out to dry and use them as blankets. in the morning, i would go to the public tap, remove my clothes, bathe, dry myself with the same set of clothes and carry on with the rest of my day., the questions in my head were ceaseless: how did i fall from the frying pan into the fire? for the first time ever, i saw pavement dwellers. why did we all have to live like animals? i gradually learnt about eviction and demolition. and then about homelessness. where could one live? i figured there wasn’t much of a choice., my journey had begun; i needed to do something about all this. from then on, i have been organising people, taking up issues of slum sanitation, eviction and demolition, and trying to find solutions., it’s important for me — for all of us — to talk about our slums. there is an entire section of society living in deplorable conditions, because of which the city’s health and economy are being dragged down., the way things are, there is no collective vision; no rules either. nearly 60 per cent of mumbai lives in slums, but a good chunk of the municipal corporation’s agenda is devoted to gardens, roads, parking and so on; the slums don’t feature. in our lopsided system of political representation, slum dwellers have been relegated to a vote bank. they are patronised, and encouraged to live in deprivation., look at dharavi, for instance. the government has no policy for asia’s largest slum. in the past 15 years, there has been no development in terms of roads, drains, toilets, or common areas. the main road has seen encroachments, encouraged by a former politician., clean the city, build toilets, mumbai lets off a big stench. people call it slumbay. what are the reasons? poor sanitation and environment, contaminated drinking water and crowded conditions., even today, 40 per cent of people in mumbai don’t have access to a toilet. in dharavi, 33–35 per cent of people live in 60-sq-ft areas. we’re talking about five-member families living in that space. how can you think of having individual toilets there? the airport slum doesn’t have a single toilet. how long will this continue?, n mumbai needs sanitation that is not dependent on the sewer system alone. sewerage systems require a capital cost, which the government cannot afford. and the rehabilitation of people will cost them 100 times more than their investment in sewerage lines. nearly 65 per cent of dharavi is not covered by a sewer system. to do so, you need to rehabilitate 80 per cent of the people living here., everyone is talking about swachh bharat, but how many toilets have been constructed in slums under this project? the government could have claimed it had cleaned mumbai, so working with smaller cities would be relatively easier. you have to show what you have done in a difficult situation first., n our sanitation needs to be customised to our living and weather conditions. unlike the west, we cannot afford individual toilets or sewer lines. we have to work towards providing collective, shared and community toilets. we can achieve two agendas at one go: if the municipality invests money in a slum (in the form of toilets) it cannot demolish it., n the main focus should be on how to clean the city. without getting into the politics of it, we need to ask if a mechanism has been created for the purpose. even after we have created wards, there is nothing to show on the ground. where and how is the money being used?, n a city like mumbai should have had an ias officer as the head of sanitation. every area needs a dedicated sanitary inspector, with the additional role of mapping the area and reporting to the higher authority., alternative housing, in the 80s, there were around 600 slum pockets in the city. now it has gone up to 3,000., no one comes to mumbai for the pleasure of getting a house in a slum. they are in tough situations, therefore they migrate. we need to address the needs of those already living in slums by giving them better housing. we need to do away with the dehumanised category of ‘shanty’., former municipal commissioner s.s. tinaikar used to say, “mumbai has so much land, you can arrange to have another city like it.” land needs to be given to the people, but not for free., the development plan outlines a clear policy of homes for the dishoused. there is also a pavement policy, which former secretary, special projects, sanjay ubale and i hammered into shape. the subsequent government resolution said all pavement dwellers are eligible for a house, just like slum dwellers. i was able to secure 4,710 sq.m. land for rehabilitation in mankhurd., there are policies, but the government is sleeping on them, while the people don’t have anyone to organise them into agitating for their due., the government often says it can’t give land because it is reserved. so i tell people, let every slum- or pavement-dweller identify 10-15 pieces of land. if they say it is reserved for a university, ask for a third, a fourth, and so on. after 220 land reservations, can they still say no? there is land, only the will is missing., over a decade ago, i was working with the mmrda on the mumbai urban transport project-ii. i told the sukhtankar committee that the government could float a tender asking for free housing on the land in the project. the first housing scheme was initiated by us. all 20,000-30,000 families have been rehabilitated on it. that means the mmrda has the land and houses., the slum rehabilitation authority (sra) has failed because of corruption and mismanagement; it has become a money-making mission for the government., the first question a councillor asks these days is, “isme mera kya hai? what’s in it for me?” you have 365 cooperative housing societies built under the sra, but most of the residents have had to dedicate 20 per cent extra, or out-of-pocket expenses, like paying someone to approve a document, an extension, or adding a name to a registration. that’s why these societies have taken in only 150 families., in an sra house, you are charged more than five times what you pay in a slum for water. do you expect a rehabilitated person can pay that much? an sra home, then, is not affordable. nobody is going into why the sra scheme hasn’t picked up in mumbai, and why there are so many slums. they have set 269 sq.ft. as the base under the sra, and 300 sq.ft. in dharavi. but a political party wants 400 sq.ft. once this is done, airport slum dwellers will demand the same. this doesn’t just involve finding land; it’s also a question of rehabilitation., the government is doing nothing for affordable housing, which in any case costs rs. 5 lakh and above. besides, most ‘affordable’ homes are outside the city, or in far-flung areas; this requires the creation of a transportation network., our politicians and bureaucrats have learnt nothing from the mistakes of the sra or rehabilitation over the past 35 years. therefore, we live with myths like ‘there is no land’. to begin with, slums are on the ground level. in urban india, you cannot afford to live in a ground-floor structure, simply because the land cost is so high. you compensate for that by getting into an sra house. but if you want to live here, you have to change your living pattern. you live without a toilet for years; you don’t talk about it., i’m not asking everyone to go to an sra accommodation. regularise or recognise a slum and maintain a standard; instead of a corrupt sra society, slums could be more organised. we also need a housing guideline., other fixes, women must be at the centre, local residents, particularly women, need more representation in decision-making. for every issue, be it toilets, housing or water, women are worst affected. a man can meet his needs outside the home: he can use the toilet in his factory, or a public toilet. in most cases, women are tied to the home; their representation is token., use ngos better, today, you have more than 6,000 non-governmental organisations (ngos) registered with the charity commissioner. every ward could be allotted 10 to 15 ngos for specific issues of their choice; this will fix responsibility. the government could create that kind of flexibility, by inviting a ward’s prominent ngos to a meeting and assigning them duties. a coordinating body could be responsible for their functioning., in other words, identify the issue, then create a system and then monitor it, all within a budget., ngos, on their part, need to raise the issue of sanitation in their wards. for now, they are just “talking revolutionaries” who often don’t get down to hard work., generate debate, the government should take these issues to the people, create forums where debate can happen without fear of reprisal being targeted. right now, there is a disconnect between the grassroots and the policy-makers., what you see today is the result of the administration not looking after the city. mumbai is actually well organised, with every inch of land governed by the administration. they ought to be more in control of encroachment though., there is a hindi saying: ‘billi ki nazar chichde mein rehti hai the cat always looks for the cream’. similarly, the politician always looks at how many votes he can garner in an area. he never looks at problems like housing or a poor living environment.",0.08099738885453174,"better mumbai , fix slums first","child walks alley dharavi , asia ' largest slum , mumbai , india , wednesday , jan. 21 , 2009. golden globes winning ' slumdog millionaire ' , british-indian film mumbai slum boy ' rise game-show glory released india two languages jan. 23.

2016-08-04,the age of gst dawns,"the introduction of a >unified goods and services tax (gst) across the nation is the most important indirect tax reform since independence. it has taken almost 16 years from the date of inception of the idea, formation of a task force, to passage in parliament. it represents a herculean, nationwide, multi-party consensus-building exercise which is finally bearing fruit., the upside of gst it has huge implications. first, it addresses a serious impediment to our competitiveness. without the gst, there are multiple points of taxation, and multiple jurisdictions. we also have an imperfect system of offsetting credits on taxes paid on inputs, leading to higher costs. further there is cascading of taxes — that is, tax on tax. interstate commerce has been hampered due to the dead-weight burden on central sales tax and entry taxes, which have no offsets. all this will go once the gst is in place. it will enhance the ease of doing business, and make our producers more competitive against imports., second, the adoption of the gst is an iconic example of what prime minister narendra modi has called “cooperative federalism”. it represents a national consensus, an outcome of a grand bargain struck together by 29 states and seven union territories with the central government. the states agreed to give up their right to impose sales tax on goods (vat), and the centre gave up its right to impose excise and services tax. in exchange they will each get a share of the unified gst collected nationally. the anticipated additional gains in efficiency, competitiveness and overall tax collections are what drove this bargain., third, once the gst is in place, it means a unified, un-fragmented national market for goods and services, accessible to the smallest entrepreneur. companies need not maintain stock depots to avoid paying interstate taxes. this will free up some capital. all this will add to demand, and also efficiency. the national council for applied economic research and others have estimated that national gdp growth can go up by one percentage point on a sustained basis., fourth, because the structure of claiming input tax credit is linked to having proof of taxes paid at an earlier stage in the value chain, this creates interlocking incentives for compliance between vendor and customer. no more questions from a vendor: “would you like that with receipt or without receipt?” because of this inherent incentive, the total taxes paid, and hence collected, may go up significantly. this provides buoyancy to the gst. in fact, a significant part of the black economy will enter the tax-paid economy., the potential downside all of this constitutes the upside of adopting the gst. its roll-out represents a rare and historic political consensus. but that should not blind us to its potential downside, or the devil lurking in the details of its implementation. here are some issues to consider., first is the question of the uniform gst rate. what should it be? an early report of the finance ministry from 2003 mentioned a rate of 12 per cent. over the years this rate drifted higher, and the focal number being discussed now is 18 per cent. what determines this number?, the empowered committee of finance ministers uses a concept called “revenue neutral rate” or rnr. the rnr is that uniform rate which when applied will leave all states with the same revenue as before. so no state should lose out by signing up to the gst. but this approach is faulty, since unless we try it for a year (or more) we won’t be able to gauge the buoyancy of the gst. in trying to assuage the fears of states, the calculation of the rnr has been loaded by every possible existing tax (like entry tax, octroi, etc.). this has caused the rnr to steadily escalate upward. at one point, the national institute of public finance and policy mentioned 26 per cent. the higher the rnr (and hence gst rate), the more is its inflationary impact. this is a sure way of killing the golden egg-laying goose. a better approach is to keep the gst rate low initially, and promise to fully reimburse losing states by the end of the year. everyone may be in for a pleasant surprise by gst buoyancy. but this tax buoyancy will stop working beyond a certain threshold (like say 18 or 20 per cent). the focus on the rnr is self-defeating., taxation and litigation the second issue is that the gst is an indirect tax. by their very nature, indirect taxes are regressive because they affect the poor more than the rich. india’s ratio of indirect to direct tax collection is 65:35, which is exactly the opposite of the norm in most developed countries. india’s ratio of direct tax to gdp is one of the lowest in the world, and it badly needs to expand the direct tax net. only 4 per cent of india pays income tax, but practically all indians pay indirect taxes in one form or the other. direct tax rates have been falling, and indirect tax rates rising. for instance, service tax (an indirect tax) used to be 5 per cent in the 1990s and is now more than 15 per cent. the swachh bharat cess, or frequent increase in excise duty on petrol and diesel are all recent examples of regressive indirect tax. unless a rate cap is adopted, the gst rate could easily drift higher, further hurting india’s income inequality. to meet their fiscal needs, it is always tempting for governments to tweak indirect taxes higher, since the work of expanding the direct tax net is so much harder. this temptation must be curbed with a rate cap., the third issue is of tax litigation. approximately rs.1.5 lakh crore is stuck in litigation related to central excise and service taxes. on the other hand the state-level vat is administered in a way that empowers tax officials to dispose of cases quickly. disputes involving central taxes go though an appeal and tribunal process, and can drag on for years. but empowered staff under the sales tax commissioner can dispose of valid grievances of state-level vat payers much faster. this difference is called the “review” versus “revise” approach to tax disputes. it is important that the gst approach leans towards the more efficient state-level model.",0.1449180747567844,age gst dawns,"introduction >unified goods services tax ( gst ) across nation important indirect tax reform since independence. taken almost 16 years date inception idea , formation task force , passage parliament. represents herculean , nationwide , multi-party consensus-building exercise finally bearing fruit. , upside gst huge implications. first , addresses serious impediment competitiveness. without gst , multiple points taxation , multiple jurisdictions. also imperfect system offsetting credits taxes paid inputs , leading higher costs. cascading taxes — , tax tax. interstate commerce hampered due dead-weight burden central sales tax entry taxes , offsets. go gst place. enhance ease business , make producers competitive imports. , second , adoption gst iconic example prime minister narendra modi called “cooperative federalism ” . represents national consensus , outcome grand bargain struck together 29 states seven union territories central government. states agreed give right impose sales tax goods ( vat ) , centre gave right impose excise services tax. exchange get share unified gst collected nationally. anticipated additional gains efficiency , competitiveness overall tax collections drove bargain. , third , gst place , means unified , un-fragmented national market goods services , accessible smallest entrepreneur. companies need maintain stock depots avoid paying interstate taxes. free capital. add demand , also efficiency. national council applied economic research others estimated national gdp growth go one percentage point sustained basis. , fourth , structure claiming input tax credit linked proof taxes paid earlier stage value chain , creates interlocking incentives compliance vendor customer. questions vendor : “would like receipt without receipt ?

2016-08-15,modi's address on the 70th independence day,"new delhi, 15/08/2016 : prime minister narendra modi addressing from the rampart of the red fort during the the 70th independence day celebrations in new delhi on monday. photo : r. v. moorthy | photo credit: r. v. moorthy , my beloved countrymen,, on this auspicious occasion of our festival of freedom; i extend lots of greetings to the one hundred and twenty five crores fellow nationals and also to entire indian diaspora spread all over the world, from this rampart of the red fort. this festival of our freedom, this 70 years of our independence, is the festival for our resolution to take the nation to new heights with a new resolve and a new fervour and new energy. we are able to breathe in a free air as the result of the sacrifices, renunciation and penance of our millions of great forefathers. we are also reminded of the youths who kissed the gallows. we also remember mahatma gandhi, sardar patel, pandit nehru and countless great persons, who fought ceaselessly for the freedom of our nation. it is the result of their struggles that we are now fortunate enough to breathe as a free citizen. india is a very ancient nation. we have a history of thousands of years and our cultural heritage is also millennia old. right from the vedas to vivekananda, from the upanishads to the satellites, the sudarshan chakradhari mohan to charkhadhari mohan, from the bhim of mahabharat to the bhimrao; we have a long historical journey and heritage. our land has seen many historical ups and downs and our generations have waged many struggles and observed penance to bequeath great values to the humanity. india's age is not just seventy years. but having won freedom after a period of subjugation; we have made efforts to take the nation forward in this journey of seventy years. sardar vallabh bhai patel united the nation. now, it is the responsibility of all of us to take make this nation better. we all have to work ceaselessly for the realization of the dream of ' one india, supreme india'. (ek bharat, shreshtha bharat)., brothers and sisters, we have not attained freedom for free of cost. innumerable were the atrocities, but undeterred were our resolves also. every indian was a soldier in the battle for freedom. each one of them dreamt of an independent india. may be every one of them was not fortunate enough to sacrifice, may be each of them was not fortunate enough to go to prison; but every indian had a resolve and the leadership of mahatma ji and also the inspiration of countless revolutionaries who had sacrificed every thing. all these movements contributed to our attainment of independence. but, now we have to convert this freedom into 'the real freedom'. now, this is the resolve of the one hundred and twenty five crores of indians. so, just as we did not attain our freedom without sacrifices; we would not be able to attain ' the real freedom' without renunciation, without human endeavour (purusharth), without bravery, without dedication and discipline. so, in order to take ahead this resolution of one hundred and twenty five crore indians; all of us will have to move ahead with our specific responsibilities in a most committed manner. be it a panchayat or the parliament, be it a village headman or the prime minister; every one of us as well as every democratic institution will have to shoulder their responsibilities completely and perfectly. only then we will be able to realize the dream of our the real freedom as soon as possible.this is correct to say that our nation is beset with many problems now- a- days. but, we should never forget that if we have the problems, then we also have all the capacities to solve them. so, if we move ahead with all our capabilities, we will find the ways and mean to solve all these problems. so, brothers and sisters, if we have lakhs of problems, then we also have one hundred and twenty five crore brains also which are all capable to solve these problems., dear brothers & sisters, there was a time when government used to be surrounded by aspersions. but now time has changed. at present, no aspersions are being leveled on the government. rather, people have great expectations from it. when the government is engulfed in expectations then it signifies hope and trust, which in turn generates those expectations. expectations give pace towards good governance, invigorates and so the pledges are implemented ad continum. my brothers & sisters, today when i am addressing you from the rampart of the red fort, it is,therefore, but natural that we should discuss the journey of good governance, the work done by the government and work being done and should be done for the country. i can present before you a very detailed account of work done and also multiple issues regarding the performance of the government. during the tenure of two years, the government has taken innumerable initiatives and multiple tasks have been done. if i start giving details about them, i am afraid i will have to talk about it for a week from this very rampart of the red fort. so instead of that temptation, i would like to draw your attention towards the work culture of the government. sometimes, it is easier to present the account of work done. but, it is not easy for a common man to comprehend, understand and identify the work culture without dwelling deep into the work culture. my brothers & sisters, my countrymen, i would not talk solely about the policy, but also the intention and decisions of the government., dear brothers & sisters, it is just not an issue of direction and outline, rather it is about holistic approach and a resolve for transformation. it is confluence of trinity of expectation of people, democracy and support of people. it is both wisdom and consent. it is also pace and realisation of progress. therefore, my countrymen, when i talk about the good governance, it does implies bringing in transformation in the life of common man of my country. good governance means that the government should be sensitive, responsive and dedicated to the common man. then only good governance gets the emphasis. responsibility and accountability should be at the root of it and it should draw its vital energy from there only for the government to be sensitive, dear brothers and sisters. we remember the days when there used to be a very long wait to go to any big hospital. people used to come to aiims, spend two three days and then only it would be decided what diagnostic tests were to be done. now we have been able to change this system. registration is done online and the doctor’s appointment is also given online. the processes start on arrival of the patient at the appointed hour itself. not only this but all his medical records are also available online. and we wish to develop it as a countywide culture in the field of medical treatment. today this system has been put in place in 40 big hospitals of the country. its basic premise is that the government has to be sensitive., dear brothers and sisters, the government should be accountable. if it be not so then the problems of the common man are kept pending for solutions. how does the change come? now technology is there, but there was a time when the railway ticket in the railways, concerning the common man and the poor was available only two thousand tickets per minute. those who might have seen it, would know how the buffering used to be there, nobody knew when the website would be operational again, but today i have to say with satisfaction that now it is possible to have fifteen thousand tickets per minute.the government should be accountable, it should take steps according to the necessities and expectations of the people. there is a class across the country, particularly the middle class, higher middle class whom you see troubled more at the hands of the income tax officials rather than the police at times. i have to change the situation and i am trying and i will certainly change it., there was a time when a common and honest citizen used to give two rupees extra as a measure of caution at the time of paying his income tax. he used to think that he might not be harassed, but once the money was deposited to the government exchequer, he had to run from pillar to post and seek recommendations for getting the refund. it took months together before the rightful money of the citizen was returned to him from the government exchequer. today, we have made a system of issuing online refund. today, refunds are given in one, two say or three weeks. those who are hearing me today on tv, they would also be realising that they had not given any application, yet they had got refund directly into their account. so, this responsibility and accountability are the results of these efforts., it is equally important to lay emphasis on the transparency for good governance. you know that a global relationship has already started to become a common thing in the society today. a middle class man wants to have his passport- there was a time when about 40 lakh, 50lakh applications were received for getting passport. today, approximately 2 crore people apply for the passport. brothers and sisters, earlier 4-6 months were taken for scrutiny of applications if one did not have recommendations. we changed that situation and today, i can say with pride that passports are issued to the citizens with all genuine details, in about one or two weeks and there is transparency no recommendation is required and there is no dilly-dallying. today, i can say, we have issued 1.75 crores passports (in 2015-16 itself.), in surajya there must be efficiency in governance and therefore, earlier, if a company had to set up a factory or desiring to do business in our country, applications were submitted. there was a task of registration only, one wanted to do something for the country, but almost 6 months passed in normal course. brothers and sisters, if efficiency is brought, then the same government, same rules, same officials have got geared up to perform the same task of company registration within 24 hours and they are virtually doing it. in the last july itself, they performed the task of more than 900 such registrations., brothers and sisters, good governance is also necessary for surajya and the steps we have taken towards this good governance are that, as i had said last year from the red fort that we would exempt group 'c' and group 'd' posts from interviews, they might get job on the basis of merit. we have detected almost 9,000 posts for which thousands and lakhs of people need to be recruited. now, there would not be any interview process for these 9,000 posts, my young men would not need to spend any money for interviews. recommendations would not be needed, roads for corruption and agents will be shut and this work has been implemented., brothers and sisters, there was a time when a common man got satisfied if the government announced any plan or merely announced that this would be done, he used to think that something concrete would happen now. then, a time came when people asked for the plan unless the drawing of the plan came. then, there was a time when people asked for the budget. today, the mood of the country has changed in 70 years. it does not get satisfied with the announcement, it is not satisfied by seeing the plan, if a budget provision is made, it is not ready to accept this. it is accepted when things get implemented on ground and we cannot bring things on ground with the old pace. we have to speed up our work, increase the pace further and then we can say that we have done something., rural roads are a perpetual issue in our country. each rural citizen craves for pakka roads. its a huge task. atal behari vajpayi ji took this task specifically .even succeding governments continued this and the work continued. we have made efforts to fast track it. earlier 70-75 km of rural roads were completed in a day. now we have increased that pace up to 100km a day. this pace will fulfil the aspirations of common man in the days to come., we have aid emphasis on energy, specifically renewable energy in our country. that was a time, when after so many years of independence, we started working on wind energy. within a period of last one year we have increased it up to 40%.so this is the scale of up acceleration. whole world is focussing on solar energy. we have increased it approximately 116%-118%.this is not only a substantial incremental change, it’s a huge leap forward. we intend to enhance the things in quantum way., in our country, even before forming of our government, we had the power production. but to reach the power, you need transmission lines and the good transmission infrastructure. two years preceding the formation of our government,30-35 thousand kilometres of transmission lines were being laid annually. today i wish to submit this with satisfaction that we have raised this to 50,000 kilometres. so we have increased the pace here. if we take the commissioning of railway lines in previous 10 years, where commissioning means capacity to ply the trains and to finish all the trials, so earlier it was at the rate of 1500 kilometre in 10 years . but we have made it up to 3500 kilometre in last 2 years. we are to increase this pace even further., brothers and sisters, now we are connecting government schemes to adhaar card, focussing on stopping the leakages through direct benefit transfer. previous government had connected four crore people to government schemes via adhaar card. today i can say this with satisfaction that in place of that work of four crore, we have completed the task of connecting 70 crore people to government schemes via adhaar card. the remaining will also be taken into the fold., today, for middle class or for common people the ownership of a car is a matter of pride. there was a time when gas stove at home was deemed as a standard and as a symbol of social status. during the last 60 years of independence, 14 crore lpg gas connections were given. brothers and sisters, it is a great satisfaction to me that on one side, 14 crore gas connections were given in 60 years, while on the other side, we have given 4 crore gas connections in just 60 weeks. please compare the two figures - 14 crore in 60 years and 4 crore in 60 weeks. this is the speed, by which a change has become possible in the quality of life of common men. we have also started the task of eradicating obsolete laws. the burden of unnecessary laws has been creating hindrance in the functioning of the government, the judiciary and the public. we have identified 1700 such laws, out of which 1175 laws have already been repealed by the parliament and several other such laws are in the process of repealing., brothers and sisters, it had become a tendency among the people to say that certain work can be done and certain other work cannot be done, certain work cannot be done now and certain work cannot be done ever. a kind of negativity was prevalent in the minds of people. now, a clear break through is visible in the mindset, a new synergy is seen in the functioning of the government. when an accomplishment is achieved, it stimulates dynamism, which sharpens our determination and then, the end result is not far away., brothers and sisters, when we had launched ""prime minister jan-dhan yojana"", it was almost an impossible task. there were banks and the governments, nationalisation had already taken place, but the common man of the country was not able to be a part of the mainstream of national economy., brothers and sisters, we have attained this impossible task through inclusion of 21 crore persons under ""jan-dhan yojana"". this is not a matter of taking credit by the government, it is really an achievement of 125 crore countrymen of the country, for which i salute them. the campaign for women pride in villages of the country is an important issue of today. the practice of open defecation should be stopped; toilets should be built in villages. when i had got the first opportunity to address from the ramparts of the red fort, i had expressed my feelings about it. now, i can claim that more than 2 crore toilets have already been built in villages of the country within such a short period. more than 70 thousand villages are now free from the practice of open defecation. we are working towards bringing change in the lives of common man., i had earlier announced from the ramparts of the red fort that we would electrify those 18 thousand villages, which are still without electricity.we are going to complete 70 years of independence, but they had not seen electricity. they were forced to live in the 18th century. we undertook this task of making possible the impossible and today i am glad to say that, though we have not been able to complete even half the task within a thousand days, we are still away from the half-mark, out of the 18 thousand, electricity has reached ten thousand villages. i have been told that there are many among those villages who are watching independence day celebrations for the first time today on television in their homes. today, from here i extend special greetings to those villages., brothers and sisters, you will be surprised to know that at merely three hours journey from delhi, there is a village called nagla fatela in hathras region. it takes only three hours to reach this nagla fatela. but it took 70 years for electricity to reach there. 70 years, my brothers and sisters! and therefore, i am introducing you to the work culture that we are following., brothers and sisters, the led bulbs were developed by the science and the researchers for welfare of every citizen. but in india it used to cost 350 rupees. who would buy it? and even the government would think, “it’s alright. the work is done. someone must be using it.” but this should not be the attitude. if led bulbs can bring about a change in the life of a common man, if it can ameliorate the environment, if it can improve india’s economy, then the government must make efforts in this direction. it is the nature of the government that it intervenes where it is not required and shies away from intervening where it is needed. we tried to change this situation, this work culture. and therefore, the bulb which used to be sold at 350 rupees, it is now being sold at 50 rupees because of governmental intervention. see the difference! 350 rupees on one hand and 50 rupees on the other. i do not want to ask where all this money used to go, however, thirteen crore bulbs have been distributed till date., the politics of our country has become populist; the economic policies have become populist. if three hundred rupees subsidy for each bulb had been given from public exchequer, the prime minister would have been applauded for doling out five hundred crore to the people. but we have ensured that they save thousands of crores by providing bulbs at only fifty rupees. we have already distributed thirteen crore bulbs and we have resolved to distribute 77 crores and i would like to appeal to my countrymen to use led bulbs in their homes and save 200, 300, 500 rupees in a year and save energy and save our environment. the day we achieve the target of 77 crore bulbs, we would be saving 20 thousand mega watt of electricity. when we save 20000 megawatt electricity, it means we save around 125000 crores rupees. brothers and sisters, you can save 125000 crore rupees of the country by using a led bulb at your home. we can fight against global warming by saving 20000 megawatt electricity and contribute a lot towards the efforts aimed at the protection of environment and a common man can also contribute to it. so, brothers and sisters, we have worked in that direction-making the impossible possible., you know that we depend on other countries of the world for energy and petroleum products and for that we have signed long term agreements with them so that we could get these products at fixed prices for a long period. we have entered into an agreement with quatar for buying gas till 2024 but the prices are so high that it is costly for our economy. it was a result of our foreign policy relationship that we were able to renegotiate with quatar, and the agreement which was the right of quatar, and we were bound to buy gas from it till 2024, we negotiated with them and today, i can say with satisfaction that we made an impossible task possible, they renegotiated their prices and it will save 2000 crore rupees of the exchequer of india. they were entitled to get these 20000 crore rupees but the nature of relationship that we have with them and our policies have made it possible. the negotiations have been going on during the tenure of all the governments and efforts were also made for chabahar port, which is an important link for connecting us with central asia, but today i feel satisfied to see an impossible task becoming possible. when iran, afganistan and india collectively march ahead in a planned way for the construction of chabahar port, an impossible task becomes possible., my brothers and sisters, one thing, i want to talk about and which concerns the common man is inflation. it is true that the inflation rate had crossed 10% mark during the tenure of previous government. due to our sustained efforts we were able to keep it below 6 percent. not only this, we have, recently, made an agreement with the reserve bank of india that the rbi should take steps to control the inflation at the level of 4 percent with allowance of plus minus 2. we should leave behind the talks of balance between inflation and growth and work for moving ahead. but the country witnessed drought during last two years and the effect of drought are readily seen on the prices of vegetables and the outcomes of sluggishness of market have resulted in some problems. the decline in the production of pulses due to drought during last two years was also a cause of concern. but, brothers and sisters, if the inflation would have increased at the same pace as it had previously increased, i don’t know how the poor of my country would have survived? we have tried our best to keep it under check, but still people have lot of expectations from this government and dear countrymen your expectations are natural and i will not leave no stone unturned in achieving them. whatever best i can do, i shall do that and keep the price of poor man’s meal under check., my dear brothers and sisters, country is going to celebrate the 350th anniversary of guru gobind singhji. how can the country forget the saga of sacrifice which has been the tradition of sikh gurus? today, when we are celebrating the 350th anniversary of guru gobind singhji, i recall one best thought expressed by guruji. guru gobind singhji use to say, how can i consider those hands pure which have not done any service, hands which have not strengthened by labour and have not developed any blisters by toiling hard? guru gobind singhji use to say this. today, when we are celebrating the 350th anniversary of guru gobind singhji i remember our farmers. whose hands are more pure than theirs? whose hearts are more pious than their? whose intentions can be more pure than theirs? i thanks our farmers that despite two years of drought, they consistently endeavored to fill our granaries, i greet them for this. drought situation has changed and this time we are witnessing good monsoon. heavy rains have also created problems at some places. government of india stood with those states and citizen who suffered due to heavy rains. today, i specially want to thank our farmers, because, when we are facing shortage of pulses and our farmers have shifted to other crops, and rise in demand of pulses by common man, i have to say this with content that this time our farmers have increased the sowing by one and half times. i want to thank our farmers because they have come forward to solve the problem of the crisis of pulses and find its solution. we have decided the msp for pulses and declared a bonus on it. we have streamlined the process of purchase of pulses and promoting the farmers for cultivation of pulses. this will benefit us in a big way., brothers and sisters, when i was talking about work culture, one thing was clear that i do not look at the issues in isolation but as a whole. let us see it as integrated and just take agriculture under integrated things, we have developed such work culture with lot of hard work, the complete chain of which can produce a great result. first of all we focussed upon- the wellness of this soil, wellness of this land, soil health card, macro-nutrition, concern for micro-nutrition and made the farmers understand that this is lacuna in your soil, these are the good qualities, your soil is good for this crop, this is not suitable for this crop and gradually the farmers started their planning according to this soil health card. the people, who have planned, tell me, sir our expenditure has been reduced up to 25 percent and 30 percent increase is being visible n our production. this number is less at present, but in future as soon as this may pass on, this concept will gain momentum. the farmers have land and if they get water, then the farmer of my country has the power to produce gold out of the soil. the famer of my country has this power and that is why we have emphasized upon water-management, emphasized upon water-irrigation, emphasized upon water-conservation. we are emphasizing upon how every drop of water may be utilised by the farmer, how to increase the importance of water, and get per drop more crop, micro irrigation. more than 90 percent irrigation projects were lying incomplete and stalled. we have taken up the responsibility to complete those projects first of all and will work in the direction that lakh of hectares of land may get the benefit of irrigation. we have taken a big leap towards solar pump so that the input cost of the farmers may be lessened because nowadays the farmers require electricity also, they require water, they need electricity, and electricity costs dearer. on account of it, the input cost of the farmer is going to be less, the recurring expenditure is going to be less and due to owning solar pump at home will result in owning electricity, owning the sun, owning the field, owing the barn and thus our farmer would be happy. we have succeeded in distributing 77 thousands solar pumps till now., brothers and sisters, i would like to congratulate the scientists of our country. good quality seeds are also required along with soil, water and solar pumps. the scientists of our country have developed more than 131 new farmable seeds compatible to the climate and nature of india, which have the capacity to enhance our per hectare production. the values they retain are also being increased. i heartly congratulate these scientists also. the farmers require urea as well as fertilisers. there was time when black marketing was in practice to get the fertilisers, there was time when the police had to lathi-charge for fertilisers. there was time when the farmer used to watch his crop being damaged in the absence of fertilisers before his very eyes. brothers and sisters, the lack of fertilisers has become a matter of past, it has become history now. today, we have succeeded in utmost production of fertiliser by overcoming the shortage of the fertiliser., brothers and sisters, because of this production, the fertilizers are now available to the farmers in time as per their needs. similarly, we conceptualized “pradhan mantri fasal bima yojana”. it’s insurance cover includes maximum protection to farmer’s land and his agro-produce at a comparatively much lower premium, and that too with a guaranteed cover. we have constructed new warehouses to preserve 15 lakhs tons of food grains. our country’s farmers will benefit only when we move towards value addition, and for this we have laid special emphasis on food processing for the first time. we have encouraged cent percent foreign direct investment which would augment agro-based industries, and consequentially, my brothers and sisters, i believe it would help me and our farmers realize our dream of doubling latter’s income by 2022. these efforts would make it possible and for realizing the same, we have taken steps one after another., brothers and sisters, our country has a fancy for a trend. and the governments, with an aim to leave an impression, have done a lot, and to fill the bill in this country, people go for some populist things and empty the exchequer. governments have a trend of establishing an identity. brothers and sisters, i have tried my best to stay away from this allurement, and while doing so, i have tried to do several things in every range with the mantra of total transformation, transformation with transparency, reform, perform and transform., brothers and sisters, we are far more committed to build the image of hindustan than that of our government. regardless of party’s identity, the country’s identity holds primacy. for, if the country moves on, it will yield dividends for the coming generations, for centuries, and exactly, for this reason, we have accorded primacy to the country’s identity and not to our party. now a days, you must have observed the scope of our work in railways. while we are talking about having bio-toilets in train, we also cherish the dream of bullet train. while we talk about “soil health card” for farmers, we also want to march ahead in the direction of satellite and space technology. while talking about “stand-up india”, we are also taking steps towards “start-up india”. we are laying emphasis on substance than on symbolism. we are stressing on integrated development than on isolated development. leaving aside entitlement, we are focused and emphatic on empowerment because an empowering country, my brothers and sisters, provides an identity to the government through the prism of the newly declared schemes. but sometimes the old schemes just tumble down. nevertheless, the govts. is a continuity. if the earlier govts. have done some work; then it is in the national interest that the next government rectifies their shortcomings and gives a go ahead to these schemes. the arrogance that this was the work of your government and this is my govt; hence we would not do this work; is not in the fitness of the things in a democracy. this is why, with all humility, we have given similar importance to the schemes of the previous governments. this is the hallmark of our work culture as our nation is a continuous and a ceaseless system and we wish to retain that system. this is why, i have a project called progress. under this project, every month, i myself sit and review all the on going projects. you would be amazed to know that almost 119 projects worth rs. seven and a half lakh crores. started by various previous govts. were lying pending. i got all of them going. i said, so much of money have been spent on them, so, all these projects should be completed. now they are all on the way to completion. we created a project monitoring group. i asked them to look into all such projects and find out as to when were they started. i came to know that some of them were started 20 years ago, the other were started somewhere between twenty five to thirty to fifteen years earlier. the people living in the areas of these projects know all. we identified such two hundred and seventy projects worth rs. 10 lakhs crores which were inaugurated by some earlier govts. and some crores of rupees were spent on all of them; but all that money was going down the drain. we started all such stuck up projects once again. brothers and sisters, such helding up and delaying of the schemes after having spent crores of rupees on them is a criminal negligence and we have tried to tide over such things., brothers and sisters, earlier railway projects took at least two years in getting sanctions. a train is passing from somewhere, road have also been made on the both side; a rail over bridge is to be constructed. but the approval took two years. we have speeded up the approval process and have been able to shorten the approval time to three or four months, or maximum to six months., brothers and sisters, however fast we may work, whatsoever may be the number of the schemes started by us; the touchstone of good administration of any government lies in the last man delivery or the benefits accrued to that person. so, this has to be taken care off. brothers and sisters, when policies are clear, intentions are clear; then the sentiments behind the decisions are also a class part and the decisions can be taken unhesitantly. so, due to the correct policies and the correct intentions our government is taking unhesitant decisions and giving emphasis on the last man delivery., we have seen and if you also go through the newspapers of uttar pradesh, every year there were stories about the outstanding balance of sugar cane farmers. every year, there was news that this is not being done by the sugar mill owners, that was not being done by the state govt, that sugar cane farmers are in distress. thousands of crores of the rupees was outstanding. so, we made schemes in this regard and tired to ensure the last man delivery and also ensured that the amount should reach to the farmers. brothers and sisters, out of the total old outstanding balance of the thousands of crores of rupees, i would like to inform you with a lot of satisfaction that almost 99.5% has been settled. it has happened for the first time after many years. i can point out in solace that all the sugarcane which was procured and which came for marketing this time for that almost 95 per cent of farmers have got the price of sugarcane produced and i am sure and i believe that the remaining 5 percent of farmers will also be paid in the coming days., brothers & sisters, we have initiated a mission to provide lpg connections to the poor families. we have launched a dynamic mission under ""ujjavala"" scheme to get rid of smokes emanating from chulha for my poor mothers. a target has been laid down to provide gas connections to 5 crores poor families within 3 years. efforts are in progress and we have already provided gas connections to around 50 lakhs and that also have been done merely within the last hundred days - you can imagine - that it may be possible to achieve the said target even before three years. we intend to emphasis upon last mile delivery in this mission., post has steadily become irrelevant due to onlining of our post offices, information technology, whatsapp, messages, e-mail. our country is known as the chains of post offices and we have revamped these post offices. post offices are linked with poor and marginalised people. postman is the only representative of the government who is linked with the feelings and affections of the common man. we have never safeguarded the interests of the post man who has always got the affections of everyone and the postman always cares for common people. we have taken measures to convert our post office into a payment bank. by setting of these payment banks, a network of banks will be set up across the villages in the country. pepole will get the benefits of jana-dhana account. the funds of manrega for the common man is now being transferred into their respective accounts through 'aadhar', the cases of corruption are decreasing. everyone will be benefitted through the mission of converting the post office into a payment bank., brothers & sisters, psus in our country are merely set up for loss-making units or for turning into sick units slowly and steadily or for disinvestment. this has been the common practice in the past. we have strived to launch a new work-culture. today, i can point out in satisfaction that we have succeeded to turn the operation of so called notorious air india into an operational profit-making undertaking during the last year. it is a fact that which all the telcom companies of the world are profit-making units, the bsnl was turning into a heavy loss-making undertaking. we have succeeded in bringing bsnl to operational profit for the first time. nobody believed that the shipping corporation of india could also rake in profit, now it is bringing profit. there was a time when it was apprehended that how would a power factory last for a week. whether we would be able to get coal for them or not. it also used to be reported that power factories have been shut down for want of coal. now, we have sufficient stock of coal at the threshold of the power factories. it could be used for months by them. dear brothers & sisters, we have achieved it., often, you must have seen that there is huge talk of corruption in our country. i have observed it myself that how corruption has looked the poor people from the lowest strata of the society and how huge amount of money is being wasted. we have linked aadhar card and aadhar number with the government policies. dear brothers & sisters, earlier there was a system under which funds used to be released from public exchequer for widow pension, scholarship, persons with disabilities and minorities and also we used to receive list of beneficiaries. we looked into it deeply and found that even unborn children are also listed in it and getting benefit out of such schemes. these middlemen used to siphon off billions of rupees from it and nobody even took notice of it. but under the aadhar system, we have removed all these middlemen from the list of beneficiaries and directly transferred the amount to the beneficiaries and found that these are millions of such ghost beneficiaries who do not exist at all and used to receive billions of rupees from it. now that has been checked. we saved lot of amount. we decided to find out the needy persons who were excluded from that list so that the amount of money saved from it should invariably be deposited into the accounts of those persons who want to fight for their rights. we have worked in that direction to deliver it to the last man delivery and we have made it to reach it to them., all of us are aware of the coal scam. today there is no accusation on the coal auction. no stigma is attached to it. the states which excavate coal in india, will continuously earn millions of rupees in the near future. there was a time when the auction of spectrum was surrounded by allegations. we auctioned it online and that has filled the coffers of the country, bringing about healthy competition and also fetching benefits for the nation., dear brothers and sisters, today the world is passing through an era of global economy. every country today is inter-connected and inter-dependent. economically, the whole world is somehow inter-connected in one way or other. however much we may progress in our country, we’ll have to keep the global economy, global arena in view; come up to the global standards, match it also to stay relevant, and contribute, and also lead the global economy when the time comes. therefore, we’ll have to be alert all the time. we’ll have to comply with the global standards to make ourselves up to date. recently, you must have seen how the world bank, i.m.f., world economic forum, credit rating agencies and such other agencies in the world have all appreciated the progress of india. the world is constantly watching these things due to the decisions taken one after another by india in respect of legal reforms, improvement in system and changes in approach. we have very speedily improved our ranking in `ease of doing business’ ratings. in terms of foreign investment, with regard to foreign direct investment our country happens to be the most favourite destination in the world today. we have left behind even the big economies of the world in matters of growth rate and gdp., dear brothers and sisters, do you know what an u.n. institute has estimated about india for the next two years ? they have estimated that in two years india will come up to the third spot in the economic sphere in place of its present level at number ten. brothers and sisters, logistic support, infrastructure, all these things are taken into account in global standards, comparisons are made with rich countries of the world. brothers and sisters, while making analysis regarding this logistic support and infrastructure of india, the world economic forum has said that india has reached above 19 ranks as compared to earlier positions and india is moving up and marching ahead rapidly. brothers and sisters, the way we are marching ahead with a dynamic and predictable economy in our country and also in global reference- the recently passed gst law, is also an empowering step towards it and all those parties deserve appreciations for this., brothers and sisters, i had talked about a campaign from the same place- ""beti bachao-beti padhao"". we do not do any work in piecemeal. we have an integrated approach and i still need the cooperation of the society in the initiatives which we have taken in ""beti bachao-beti padhao"". every single parent need to be aware. we should honour the daughters, protect them and give them the benefit of government's schemes. we have covered millions of families under ""sukanya samridhi yojna"" which guarantees benefits for the daughters when she grows up. we given greatest importance to the insurance schemes in which women are benefitted. they are going to reap its benefits. we have ""indradhanush tikakaran yojna""-because if we ensure two things for our mothers and sisters i.e. economic empowerment and empowerment against health problems and we educate them, you can take it as an assurance that if even a single woman is educated in the family, if she is strong physically and independent economically, she has power to pull the poorest of the poor family out of poverty and therefore we are working with emphasis on empowerment of women, health of women, economic prosperity of women, physical empowerment of women in our fight against poverty., therefore, my brothers and sisters, ""mudra yojna""- i am happy that more than three and half crore families reaped the benefits of mudrayojna. in it, most of the people who reached to the door of banks were first timers. even out of these almost 80 percent people were from sc/st/obc. out of these too, 80 percent are women who took loans from banks, mudra bank. this is to be considered that how will these womenfolk will contribute in economic development. brothers and sisters! last week we decided that our mothers and sisters who have become the participants in the growth story, need leave after child birth. earlier that leave was shorter but now we have increased this to 26 weeks, enabling the new mother to take care of her infant. our weavers and the people working in textile, who make yarn and yarn rolls, used to get rs.100.we have increased that to rs.190 so as to strengthen the hands of my yarn producing mothers and sisters. our mothers, sisters and weavers who are engaged in silk production will now receive rs.50 more per meter of production. this has also been decided that this rs.50 per meter will not go either to the trader or to the middleman or to the dealer. instead this rs.50 per meter will go via adhaar directly to the account of the weaver who has produced it. this will empower the weavers. we have started schemes with this intention and effect is now visible., my dear countrymen! when we visualize railway and post office then we are able to see the unity of india. more we increase the institutions connecting india, our setup will change and that will enforce the unity of the country. so in the same tune we have started a new market scheme for farmers with the name ‘e-nam”. today farmers can sell their produce online in any of the markets of the country. now he is not constrained to compulsively sell his produce in the market which is 10 kilometers from his field .neither to sell at low prices which is not remunerative for his hard work. now a uniform sort of market network is establishing throughout the country with ‘e- nam’.gst is soon to result in uniform taxation system and a unitary arrangement thus achieved will unite india as well. you will be amazed to know that earlier a zone was to have surplus energy and there were no takers. another zone used to be in dire need of electricity, had to remain in dark and factories used to be shut. to effect a change in this scenario, we earned a great success with the ‘one nation, one grid, one price’ .earlier it used to be rs.10 per unit in summers but i went to telangana few days back to find it to be one rupee ten paise per unit instead of that age old rs. 10. this is the result of one-price system, which can connect the whole country., a worker of our county has to change his place of work after every one or two years. but, his amount, deducted under epf, is not transferred. you will be surprised to know that when i took the charge of the government, rs. 27,000 crore were lying under epf, which belonged to the workers. workers were not able to claim their amount, as they were ignorant of the relevant process. to solve this problem, we have issued a universal account number to each worker, which would enable easy transfer of fund to his new place of work. now, the worker would get his amount after retirement and it would no more be lying dormant in a government treasury., we have strengthened various initiatives such as bharat-mala, setu-bharatam, and bharat-net etc. we are working towards connecting the whole country and towards economic development of the country through all these initiatives., brothers and sisters, this year is important due to various reasons. the country is celebrating 1000th birth anniversary of saint sri ramanuja acharyaji. the country is celebrating 150th birth anniversary of shrimad rajchandra ji, the guru of mahatma gandhi. the country is celebrating 350th birth anniversary of guru gobind singh ji. the country is also celebrating centenary birth celebrations of pandit deen dayal upadhyaya ji. while remembering sri ramanuja acharya ji today, i wish to underline his message to the country. he used to say that we should serve all the devotees of the lord, irrespective of their caste and class. he had said that we should never humiliate anyone and should give respect to all, without any discrimination on the basis of age and caste. the issue that was given importance by gandhi, ambedkar, ramanujacharya, lord buddha, our scriptures and by our all spiritual gurus too is the issue of 'our social unity'., if the society disintegrates, the empire straggles, gets divided into the highs and the lows, the touchables and the untouchables, then brothers and sisters, that society cannot sustain. there are social evils, centuries old social evils, but if the social evils have become chronic, they need a bit harsh and yet sensitive treatment. the lackadaisical attitude will not solve the social problems and this is the responsibility of 125 crore citizens. the government and the society together will have to steer through the social conflicts. brothers and sisters, all of us will have to fight against the social evils. we all will have to rise above social evils in our own behavior. each and every citizen will have to rise above them and then only we can build a strong india. without empowering our society, we cannot make india strong. mere economic progress does not guarantee a strong india, the guarantee of a strong india lies in a strong society. and a strong society is built at the edifice of social justice. a strong society is built only on the edifice of social justice. therefore, it is our duty to lay emphasis on social justice. whether they be dalits, the downtrodden, the exploited, the deprived, my adivasi brothers, the rural population, the urban population, the literate or the illiterate, the small or the big- the 125 crore of our fellow countrymen constitute our family. we together have to take forward our country and we all have to work in the same direction., brothers and sisters, today the entire world acknowledges the fact that india is a country of youths. what cannot be achieved by a country through its youth power whose 65 percent population, about 800 million people, is below the age of 35 years? therefore, my brothers and sisters, it is the need of the hour that the youth get opportunity and employment. today we are heading towards the birth centenary of pandit deen dayal upadhyaya. pandit deen dayal upadhyaya spoke of welfare of the last human being which was even the view of mahatma gandhi. pandit deen dayal upadhyaya believed in the philosophy of ‘antyodaya’. welfare of the poorest and the weakest was the central theme of the political philosophy of pt. deendayal upadhyayji. he used to say that every youth should get education, every youth should be skilled and every youth should get the opportunity to realise his dreams. we have taken many initiatives to realise those dreams of pt. deendayalji and to fulfil the hopes and aspirations of 800 million youths of the country. the way the road network in the country is expanding, the largest number of vehicles are being manufactured in the country, the country is becoming the largest exporter of softwares, more than 50 new mobile factories have been set up in the country, all these things have created opportunities for the youths. if two crore door toilets have been constructed, it has provided employment to someone, cement has been procured from somewhere, iron has been purchased from some other person, and the wooden work has been got done from somewhere else. as the scope of work expands, the possibilities of employment generation also increase. today, we have stressed in that direction., similarly, we are working on 'skill development' as a mission so that crores of youth could acquire skills. we have changed a law, though it seems very small, and this law is 'model shop and establishment act'. we have sent an advisory to states to give reasons why the big malls are allowed to open 365 days and upto 12 in the night but a small shopkeeper in the village has to shut his shop after sunset. even a poor should get the opportunity to keep his shop open for 365 days. why should our sisters not get the opportunity to work in night? we have made legal provisions so that our sisters could go to work in night also. there should be arrangements for their safety and other requirements but they must get the opportunity to work. these are the things which increase employment. brothers and sisters, we are working in that direction and we are ready to do it., brothers and sisters, this is the government, we are the persons who don't believe in delaying the things, we know how to fight not how to delay, so unless we deal with the problems head-on, it is not going to happen. today when we are celebrating our freedom in the country, some one among the army jawans, who live and die for the country, would be ready for taking the bullets on the border, someone will be sitting in bunker and some other one would not be fortunate enough to meet his sister on the occasion of raksha bandhan. how many jawans are working in armed forces? more than 33000 police personnel have got martyrdom since we got our independence. why should we forget them and how can we? these are the people due to whom we can live a life of peace and happiness. the issue of “one rank one pension” was pending for many years. we do not keep the issues pending but we face them. we have fulfilled our promise of “one rank one pension” and have spread happiness in the home of every indian soldier. we did this work., it was the feeling of our countrymen that the files pertaining to netaji subhash babu should be declassified. today, i bow my head and say that without caring for the result we have decided to declassify these files; a task which was impossible and kept pending since long. we invited netaji’s family members and shown them the files and this process of declassifying will continue. i requested the other countries of the world to declassify the files held by them and hand them over to india because indians have full right to know about subhash babu and history of india. we have worked in that direction., bangladesh -- when partition of india took place, a boundary dispute existed since then. a boundary dispute prevailed since the formation of bangladesh. many decades passed. brothers and sisters, all parties have together solved the indo-bangladesh border dispute and we have amended the constitution also., brothers and sisters, a middle class person wants to construct his own house, wants to buy a flat. builders lobby shows him a beautifully printed booklet and the helpless soul falls prey to it. he is not having any technical knowledge, he pays the installments but he is not getting the promised house in time. a middle class makes one house in his whole life and in it he invests all his capital. brothers and sisters, we have put a check by passing the “real estate bill”, so that a middle class should not face any problem if he wishes to own a house. we have worked for this., brothers and sisters, i have already said that this year is the 150th anniversary of shrimad rajchandra ji, the guru of mahatma gandhi. when gandhiji was staying at south africa, then also he was having correspondence with shrimad rajchandra ji. in one of his letter shrimad rajchandra ji discussed violence and non-violence. in that letter rajchandra ji writes, when violence came in to existence from same time the principle of non-violence also born. the important thing in both is that which we prefer or which is being used in the interest of mankind., brothers and sisters, the discussion of violence and non-violence is very inherent in our country. humanity is in our blood. we are the people of a great, colossal culture. this country is full of diversity, colours and beauty. this is such a bouquet of mother india wherein all type of fragrances, all type of colours and all type of dreams exist. brothers and sisters, the unity of diversity is our biggest strength. the mantra of unity is connected to our roots., brothers and sisters, a country having more than hundred languages, hundreds of dialects, innumerable attires, innumerable life styles, despite that this country remained united- its main reason is our cultural heritage. we know how to respect, we know hospitality, we know how to assimilate, we have carried this great tradition and that is why there is no room for violence and atrocity in our country. if the democracy of india is to be strengthened, the dreams of india are to be fulfilled then the path of violence would never bring success for us. nowadays a game of killing the innocents is being played on the pretext of maoism in forests, on the pretext of extremism at border, on the pretext of terrorism at hilly areas by carrying guns on shoulders. forty years have passed, this mother soil has grown blood stained but the persons on the path of terrorism have not achieved anything. i would like to remind those youth that this country will never tolerate violence nor would it ever put up with terrorism. nor would it bow down to terrorism. it will never succumb to maoism. but i exhort them and say that you still have time-return to the mainstream. just think about your parents' dream; just reflect on the hopes and expectations of your parents; return back to the mainstream; live a happy and peaceful life, for, the path of violence never fetches benefit to anybody., brothers and sister, we talk about foreign policy. i don't want to go into details. we had invited the leaders of saarc countries on the day we took oath at the centre. our message was clear that we all, neighbouring countries, have a common problem, and that common challenge is poverty. let us fight this poverty together, by fighting one-another, we are left shattered but if we fight this poverty, we will walk towards prosperity. so, i exhort all neighbouring countries to join us in this fight against poverty. no freedom can be much bigger than the freedom of our citizens from poverty; freedom of our country's citizen from poverty. no liberation is more liberating than the freedom from poverty. whenever a citizen from the neighbouring countries would get freedom from poverty, we will feel elated regardless of the fact whether the poor belongs to us or our neighbouring country.,  brothers and sisters, what kind of people are those who got drive from humanity and, what is the kind of those who reward terrorism? i want to place two pictures before this world, and i say to the world, i say to those who believe in humanity that just weigh out the attack, when terrorists brutally killed innocent children in a school at peshawar. the attack take place in peshawar, and was a terrorist incident. the innocent children became victim of the bloodbath; the temple of learning had blood stream all around; innocent children were slaughtered. hindustan, the parliament had tears in it's eyes; every indian school was in tears; every child of india felt the trauma of the deaths of children in peshawar. his tears had become unstoppable. every child, who was killed in peshawar in the terrorist attack, ached our heart too. this is the drive of our nurtured culture of humanity; this is our humanity, but if you look around, you will find a more to glorify terrorists., where innocent people are killed in terrorist attack, and they celebrate, what type of terrorism inspired life it is, what type of these creations of the terrorism inspired governments are? the world will understand these two differences properly, this is sufficient for me. today i want to specially honour and thank to some people from the ramparts of red fort. for the past few days the people of baluchistan, the people of gilgit, the people of pakistan occupied kashmir, the way their citizens have heartily thanked me, the way they have acknowledged me, the goodwill they have shown towards me, the people settled far across, the land which i have not seen, the people i have not met ever, but people settled at far across acknowledge the prime minister of india, they honour him, so it is an honour of my 125 crores countrymen, it is respect of my 125 crores countrymen and that is why owing to the feeling of this honour, i want to heartily thank the people of baluchistan, the people of gilgit, the people of pakistan occupied kashmir for having an expression of thankfulness., brothers and sisters, today when we are celebrating the seventy years of independence, then there is a big contribution of freedom soldiers for the country. when there is a contribution of these freedom soldiers, then the government is deciding to increase 20 percent in the honouring amount being received, pension being received by the all these honourable freedom soldiers family members. the freedom fighters who earlier used to get 25000 rupees, will now get 30000 rupees. it is my small effort to pay my respects to the sacrifice and oblation of our freedom fighters., brothers and sisters, when we talk about the history of freedom struggle of our country, some persons are talked about a lot, some are excessively mentioned but the contribution made by the people living in jungles, the tribals, in the freedom struggle was unmatched. they used to live in jungles. we hear the name of birsa munda but perhaps there would be no tribal dominated district where the tribals would not have fought and given sacrifice since 1857 to the time we got freedom. they proved through their sacrifice what is freedom, what is struggle against servitude. but our forthcoming generations are not much aware of this history. the government desires and plans that in the coming days, in the states where these freedom fighters, who were tribals, who lived in jungles, fought against britishers, who were not ready to succumb. the government would work towards building permanent museums in various states dedicated to tribal brave freedom fighters, wherever land would be available for the purpose, where their contributions and memoirs would be displayed, so that coming generations could be able to know about their sacrifices for the country., brothers and sisters, in the midst of the debate on inflation, we are realising one fact that the entire economy of a poor household is affected if somebody falls ill. the wedding of their daughters gets stalled, the education of children gets stalled and sometimes even food is not available in the evening. healthcare is getting costlier and that is why, i am announcing an important scheme from the ramparts of the red fort for the healthcare of bpl families. government are faking an important for such families. under this scheme, in the coming days, if such poor families have to take medical facilities, the government will bear expenditure upto rs.1 lakh per year, so that my poor brothers are not deprived of healthcare facilities and their dreams are not shattered., my dear brothers and sisters, let us proceed forward with a new determination, new energy, new enthusiasm by getting inspiration from those great persons who scarified their lives for our freedom. we did not get an opportunity to die for the country but we have the opportunity to live for the country. we should dedicate our life to the nation. we should achieve something of substance for the nation. we should fulfill our responsibilities and also inspire others to accomplish their responsibilities. we should stride forward for building of one society, one dream, one resolution, one direction and one destination. with this very pious feeling, i once again bow my head before the great personalities of the country, the soldiers who risk their lives for our security on water, land and air fields and also those 33 thousands martyrs who sacrificed their lives for us. so,i, hereby, dedicate myself to dream about the future of the country and call on all of you from

2016-10-08,before he became mahatma,"illustration: deepak harichandan , gandhi scholars generally see his political work in south africa (1893-1914) as but a prelude to the remarkable role he played in reshaping the politics of the indian freedom struggle. in recent years, however, a flurry of writings on gandhi, some authored by known south african scholars, has catapulted to the centre stage of gandhiana his ‘racist’ attitude towards africans and coloured people, exclusion of this segment from the political struggles that he organised, his failure to form political alliances with all oppressed people, his sexual preferences, and his imperial patriotism. how do we begin to reconcile these insights with the widely held belief in india and abroad that gandhi is a mahatma?, we can follow different paths to address this contradiction in gandhi’s thought. we can, for instance, shrug off the problem by quoting the poet walt whitman: “do i contradict myself? very well then, i contradict myself, i am vast, i contain multitudes.” gandhi certainly contained multitudes, he held odd views on social relations, his defence of the caste system is unjustifiable, and he was eccentric to a fault. but he also had an extraordinary gift for understanding the political significance of the moment, and grasping it. he lived a life of contradictions, as we all do. , alternatively, armed with numerous cups of tea as munna bhai did in the marvellous film lage raho munna bhai, we burrow into dusty volumes of his letters and writings, acknowledge he was wrong at that moment of his life, and cite him to establish self-correction in his later life. the project is tiresome but doable. thereby we follow the french marxist philosopher louis althusser, who in the 1960s pointed out an ‘epistemological break’ in marx’s thought, and distinguished between the ‘young’ and the ‘mature’ marx. we can accordingly speak of a ‘young’ and a ‘mature’ gandhi., or we can focus on the historical context of his remarks. the cambridge historian quentin skinner suggests that before we judge words spoken in the past, we must know what they signified then. in the work the prince (1513), the florentine philosopher niccolò machiavelli advises the ruler of florence, lorenzo de' medici, thus. a prince, he said, must know when not to be virtuous. for these words, machiavelli has been slammed throughout history as the teacher of evil, and as immoral for separating, as he did, ethics and politics. prof. skinner asks us to consider what virtue meant in 16th century florence. at that time virtue signified either a life devoted to reflection in the platonic sense, or a life lived in accordance with the tenets of christian morality. lorenzo de' medici, destined in machiavelli’s view to unite a fragmented and conquered italy, needed a different set of virtues. he had to possess pagan virtues of honour, valour, and courage. virtue held different implications in the public sphere compared to the private sphere. consider the time gandhi lived in settler-dominated south africa. dominant linguistic conventions sanctioned the use of derogatory terms for non-whites. indians, for instance, were called coolies. gandhi erred because he did not question a practice that violated his own understanding of what human beings are due. , does it really matter if gandhi statues and photographs are removed, if m.g. roads are renamed, or if our present government tries to depoliticise a politically subversive leader by designating october 2 as swachh bharat? gandhi, who wielded the broom with some dexterity, would not have minded. as munna bhai’s inner-self manifested as gandhi’s apparition instructs him, do all this, just keep my teachings in your heart. , but there was a time when african freedom movements drew upon gandhi; today, nationalist africans attack him. therefore, none of the paths suggested above might help us to reconcile the contradiction in gandhi’s ideas or mollify our african friends. witness the extent of anger. in june 2016 a gandhi statue was installed in the university of ghana during the visit of president pranab mukherjee. soon thereafter a number of academics, students, and artists demanded the removal of the statue. last year an online campaign ‘#ghandimustfall hashtag’ gained traction, even as his statue in johannesburg was vandalised in april during a rally against ‘gandhi the racist’. , this anger is understandable. there was a time when indian leaders were committed to solidarity with other postcolonial countries. today as indian industrialists/entrepreneurs compete with china to appropriate land and resources in sub-saharan africa, we see the rise of resentment against the new colonisers. therefore, gandhi, who inspired nelson mandela, julius nyerere, and kwame nkrumah, is now unacceptable to many africans. the exploitation of vulnerable countries by india, an emerging power, has bred a rather bitter harvest. , we can ask why something said or done a hundred years ago still has the power to evoke offence. arguably, a reinvented nationalism that has swept the world as ‘hatred of the other’ revisits the past to identify those who belong, and those who do not. in parts of africa, gandhi is clearly perceived as someone who came in from the outside, and began to mobilise an otherwise disparate community of indians: indentured labour, memon and bohra merchants locally called arabs, and other indians against discriminatory laws. he was indifferent to the plight of african and coloured people. , but that was not his project. gandhi entered south africa as an inexperienced and brief-less lawyer to assist a case involving two prominent memon traders. at that time of his life, a 24-year-old gandhi believed that the british empire would ensure the freedom of its subjects in an oppressive settler colony. he supported the british in the boer war (1899-1902), and raised a unit of stretcher bearers to accompany troops to the front. he expected the british to reciprocate by protecting indians. his hope was belied, and gandhi the imperial patriot was transformed into gandhi the leader who touched the hearts and minds of millions. he learnt the grammar of anti-colonial nationalism in exile, and amidst oppression, much as irish immigrants became fenians on american soil.

it’s aim: digital empowerment by creating digital infrastructure, delivering services digitally, and increasing digital literacy. more recently, in maharashtra, chief minister devendra fadnavis announced one of the biggest public wifi projects in the world: 500 hotspots in mumbai went live on january 9., but for the residents of gazdhar bandh — and many others across one of india’s best-connected cities — not much has changed on the ground. “the free wifi zones announcement is humbug,” says dr. anita patil-deshmukh, executive director, pukar. the reason, she says, is because there is a huge gap between the number of users and available facilities., setting up of wifi spots is a good starting point, says abhay karandikar, professor at the department of electrical engineering at iit bombay, but what has to be built into the plan is a sustainable service and connectivity model. the state government must consider that mumbai is densely packed, more so than many other global cities. “we will probably need several hundreds, even thousands, of hotspots.”, infrastructure issues, “how can you think of digital india,” dr. patil-deshmukh asks, “when your basic infrastructure is simply not made available to people in resource-poor neighbourhoods?” she cites kaula bunder in fort, where pukar has been working for nearly a decade. because the colony, which came up during the british raj, is on bombay port trust land, it has no electricity; those who do have power survive on stolen connections. “there are no mobile towers here, so forget about network. we have the same issue in a mankhurd slum where we are working. in our office in kherwadi, bandra east, email is very slow. we are 10 minutes away from bandra-kurla complex and this is the country’s financial capital. how do we deal with these huge gaps?” many places in the city are so dense that gps doesn’t work there. if google and insat cannot map these areas, she asks, how can you think of including them in a plan for the city? “when there’s no water, where is the space for fibre optics?”, • “right to internet is soon going to be seen as a basic right, given the number of services and opportunities moving online,” prof. karandikar says, but it is not sustainable for the government to set up hundreds of wifi spots. the government needs to look at sustainable connectivity, perhaps through a public-private partnership model, both in terms of funding and maintenance., • to some extent, the problem can be addressed by installing multiple small mobile towers and paying people whose homes are used as bases. “people in slums will love that arrangement.” dr. patil-deshmukh says, “because they need the money.”, the basics, a digital communications network depends on the availability, accessibility and affordability of broadband — high-speed internet access — via fibre-optic lines that carries large volumes of digital information faster than cable, dsl or 3g/4g., by some estimates, 58% of india’s internet users are in urban areas; most use it via mobile phones, with only 13% of households using broadband. “high costs of access, irrelevant online content/services, low digital literacy and low internet speeds, all continue to plague usage and impact the potential to scale up,” says pankaj joshi, executive director, urban design research institute (udri). “there is a large population of potential users from low-income neighbourhoods and marginalised communities who remain unconnected and excluded by service providers, resulting in a digital divide. understanding land-use requirements for physical installation of these networks is a key step to provide opportunities for them. scaling up will require sufficient investments in digital communication infrastructure especially in informal neighbourhoods, where costs need to be subsidised.”, • the urban design research institute, pukar and majlis have advocated broadband planning through the development plan. the ‘sab ke liye broadband’ campaign calls for the municipal corporation to be the planning and monitoring agency responsible for deploying broadband infrastructure, and for the private sector to be engaged in laying down last-mile connectivity. “for the mcgm, the investment has the potential to become a source of revenue,” mr. joshi says. “a private vendor will need to pay to use their fibre-to-the-kerb in order to provide last-mile connectivity.”, • for areas where infrastructure cannot be laid due to high densities or right-of-way issues, mr. joshi says, the mcgm can invest in creating public wifi spots in some of the 11,000 mcgm-owned properties like schools, hospitals, and ward offices., global best practices, “a clear strategy must also be in place to enable online services that have meaning for citizens,” mr. joshi says. “the existing land use of the mumbai development plan 2034 shows severe shortages in amenities such as educational and health facilities. bringing some of these services online can reach more people faster without requiring changes in land use or huge investments, besides creating government transparency and accountability towards citizens.” udri’s login mumbai — a site with a map overlaid with data related to population, health, education, transportation, governance and other planning parameters — gives citizens important but complex public information through easy-to-comprehend visuals to help them understand implications on their communities. “it will also serve a purpose in clarifying data and the veracity of its source, enabling a first step in citizen participation.”, across the world, cities are now recognising that greater investments need to be made to connect those who cannot afford it, and investing in municipal broadband., chattanooga, in tennessee, usa, was one of the first; in 2010, its electric power board utility launched a 1 gigabit per second municipal network. since then, the city has attracted not just startups and entrepreneurs, but also other businesses relocating in or expanding to the area. in 2016, new york proposed the new ny broadband program, a public-private partnership focussing on underserved areas. it will look for vendors to set up the infrastructure and will provide matching funds for installation., • cities must also simplify permissions and remove potential barriers for infrastructure providers. seattle, for instance, has reduced regulatory barriers to attract broadband fibre investments and encouraged public-private partnerships., true inclusion, as much as increasing internet access, digital inclusion is about policies that enable and benefit citizens., “mumbai in one sense has a big outreach,” says ravina aggarwal, director, columbia global centers, mumbai. “but is it affordable, reliable, efficient and open?” the discourse tends to be about technology, and not whether the state cares about the economically disadvantaged, she says. “it also depends on affordability and how competitive they are. how can the internet be easily accessed in different places? somebody who can afford high speed at home has a different ability to be included in the digital world than somebody who’s on a slow, municipal speed.”, “our national broadband policy, our telecom policy, they have universal service provisions as a goal,” ms. aggarwal says. for service providers, these are preconditions to get spectrum. the challenge is that providers are often afflicted with the ‘winner’s curse’: they have paid so much for licences they don’t have money for the infrastructure, so sit on their spectrum, “blocking it but not actually providing infrastructure to people they can’t recover it from.”, for government services much depends, prof. karandikar says, on the quality of the experience: ease of access, usable interfaces, quick response times. this needs both wifi connectivity as well as a robust back-end to ensure that services run smoothly., the other challenge with mumbai, he says, is that though many are familiar with the use of technology, a large section of the population has to be educated in the use of digital services. “simple transactions, like those that are being proposed through aadhaar, don’t require a high level of digital literacy. but their success will depend on whether connectivity can be established on a large scale.” for more complex transactions, online banking for instance, some level of digital education is still necessary., an essential component, dr. patil-deshmukh says, is financial and related aspects of inclusion: one should get easy access to government schemes, admissions and so on, on the internet, “without having to make 60 trips to the university or bmc office.” the second aspect is service delivery: the availability of water, healthcare and sanitation facilities. “these are fundamental; we’re not even getting into fancy stuff.”, • to enable last-mile delivery, dr. patil-deshmukh says, the government can look at subsidies to poorer sections of society., participation follows trust, “if knowledge is power,” mr. joshi says, “then providing universal access is essential to a working democracy.” this includes, he says, essential services like mobile banking, school and college admissions, tele-medicine, as well as e-governance and co-ordination during disasters., it is also necessary to create a better space for education, ms. aggarwal says, not just in the formal system, but also in building understanding of ways one can be creative in the digital space. “rather than getting messages top-down, how do you creatively use it? how can i be a discerning consumer and a producer?” this means citizens must be made comfortable with technology, unafraid of it., dr. patil-deshmukh says it’s about empowering people with knowledge and how they can leverage it as voters, especially with corporators and ward officers. “the younger generation can understand this better. they are more into development, and we’ve seen this in our younger members of parliament.” she says this will also break the back of the ‘mafia’ that corporators have become by bringing in transparency., india has one of the world’s more censored digital environments. “if you are participating, how free are you to participate?” ms. aggarwal asks. “how do we create a more accepting environment for diverse views, and how do you trust this medium where you are putting out all your information? that’s a concern.” the digital space we create will determine if we progress as an open society, tolerating diverse views. “otherwise we will continue to perpetuate proprietary kinds of knowledge.”, it’s also critical, ms. aggarwal says, to acknowledge that technology can be pervasive and intrusive, that it can force you to interact with it ways you don’t like. “that becomes a culture and you can’t step away from it. can we incentivise and create other public modes of exchange?” particularly for the poor, “identity, whether it’s through aadhar or the cashless economy, is already written into the digital world. it’s not a choice, it’s a responsibility to help people understand and navigate this space.”, broadband in policies, • broadband was recognised as key to development in may 2010, when the international telecommunication union and unesco set up the broadband commission for digital development as part of efforts to meet the millennium development goals. expanding broadband access in every country is vital to accelerating progress towards these goals by 2015, it said, seeking commitments from all member countries to effect such plans., • in india, the need for universal access to broadband infrastructure was first recognised in the national broadband policy of 2004 that set the targets for broadband penetration in rural and urban areas.",0.10936769909984198,putting e empower,"2014 , study internet penetration resource-poor neighbourhoods — covering dharavi , girgaum gazdhar bandh — partners urban knowledge , action &amp;

2017-01-26,president's address on the eve of republic day 2017,"fellow citizens:, 1.on the eve of the sixty-eighth republic day of our nation, i extend warm greetings to all of you in india and abroad. i convey my special greetings to members of our armed forces, para-military forces and internal security forces. i pay my tribute to the brave soldiers and security personnel who made the supreme sacrifice of their lives in defending india’s territorial integrity and maintaining law and order., , brothers and sisters:, 2.when india attained freedom on 15th august 1947, we did not have an instrument of governance of our own. we waited till 26th january, 1950 when the indian people gave to themselves a constitution to secure for all its citizens, justice, liberty, equality, and gender and economic equity. we promised to promote fraternity, dignity of the individual, and unity and integrity of the nation., on that day, we became the largest democracy of the world., , 3.the faith and commitment of people gave life to our constitution and our founding fathers, wisely and carefully, steered the new nation past its troubles of being a poor economy with huge regional imbalances and a vast citizenry deprived of even basic necessities., , 4.it goes to the credit of the strong institutions of democracy built by our founders that for the last six and a half decades, indian democracy has been an oasis of stability in the region troubled by unrest. from a population of 360 million in 1951, we are now a 1.3 billion strong nation. even then, our per capita income has shown a ten-fold increase, poverty ratio has declined by two-thirds, average life expectancy has more than doubled, and literacy rate has shown a four-fold increase. we are today the fastest growing amongst the major economies of the world. we are the second largest reservoir of scientific and technical manpower, the third largest army, the sixth member of the nuclear club, the sixth member in the race for space, and the tenth largest industrial power. from a net food grains importing country, india is now a leading exporter of food commodities. the journey so far has been eventful, sometimes painful, but most of the times, exhilarating., , 5.what has brought us thus far will take us further ahead. but we will have to learn to adjust our sails, quickly and deftly, to the winds of change. evolutionary and incremental growth will have to accommodate rapid disruptions brought in by advances of science and technology. innovation, more so inclusive innovation, will have to become a way of life. education will have to keep pace with technology. in the race between man and machine, the winner will have to be job generation. the velocity of technology adoption will call for a workforce that is willing to learn and adapt. our education system will have to join hands with innovation to prepare our youth for life-long learning., , fellow citizens:, 6.our economy has been performing well despite the challenging global economic conditions. in the first half of 2016-17, it grew at a rate of 7.2 percent – same as that last year – showing sustained recovery. we are firmly on the path of fiscal consolidation and our inflation level is within comfort zone. though our exports are yet to pick up, we have managed a stable external sector with sizeable foreign exchange reserves., , 7.demonetization, while immobilizing black money and fighting corruption, may have led to temporary slowdown of economic activity. as more and more transactions become cashless, it will improve the transparency of the economy., brothers and sisters:, , 8.born in independent india, three generations of citizens do not carry the baggage of colonial past. these generations have had the privilege of acquiring education, pursuing opportunities and chasing dreams in a free nation. this sometimes makes it easy for them to take freedom for granted; to forget the price that extraordinary men and women paid to win this freedom; to forget that the tree of freedom needs constant care and nourishment. democracy has conferred rights on each one of us. but along with these rights, come responsibilities which have to be discharged. gandhiji said and i quote: ""the highest form of freedom carries with it the greatest measure of discipline and humility. freedom that comes from discipline and humility cannot be denied; unbridled license is a sign of vulgarity injurious alike to self and others” (unquote)., , fellow citizens:, 9.youth today are brimming with hope and aspirations. they pursue their life goals, which they perceive will bring them fame, success and happiness, with single-minded devotion. they consider happiness as their existential objective, which of course is understandable. they search for happiness in the highs and lows of day-to-day emotions, and in the fulfilment of the objectives they have set for themselves. they look for a job as well as a purpose in life. lack of opportunities leads to frustration and unhappiness which manifests itself in anger, anxiety, stress and aberrations in behaviour. this has to be dealt with by inculcating pro-social behaviour through gainful employment, active engagement with community, parental guidance, and empathetic response from a caring society., brothers and sisters:, , 10.one of my predecessors left on my table a framed quotation which reads (and i quote): ""the object of government in peace and in war is not the glory of rulers or races but the happiness of the common man” (unquote). happiness is fundamental to the human experience of life. happiness is equally the outcome of economic and non-economic parameters. the quest for happiness is closely tied to sustainable development, which combines human well-being, social inclusion and environmental sustainability. we must make happiness and well-being of our people as the touchstones of public policy., , 11.many of the flagship initiatives of the government have been designed to promote the well-being of the society. the swachh bharat mission aims at a clean india by 2nd october, 2019 to coincide with the 150th birth anniversary of gandhiji. increased spending on programmes like mgnrega is enhancing employment generation to rejuvenate the rural economy. aadhaar, with its present reach of over 110 crore people, is helping in direct transfer of benefits, plugging leakages and improving transparency. the digital india programme is creating a knowledge economy through universal provision of digital infrastructure and platforms for cashless economic transactions. initiatives like start-up india and atal innovation mission are fostering innovation and new-age entrepreneurship. under the skill india initiative, the national skill development mission is working on skilling 300 million youth by 2022., , brothers and sisters:, 12.it is my firm conviction that india’s pluralism and her social, cultural, linguistic and religious diversity are our greatest strength. our tradition has always celebrated the ‘argumentative’ indian; not the ‘intolerant’ indian. multiple views, thoughts and philosophies have competed with each other peacefully for centuries in our country. a wise and discerning mind is necessary for democracy to flourish. more than the unison of ideas, a healthy democracy calls for conformity to the values of tolerance, patience and respect for others. these values must reside in the hearts and minds of every indian; inculcating in them a temperament of understanding and responsibility., , fellow citizens:, 13.we have a noisy democracy. yet, we need more and not less of democracy. the strength of our democracy is evidenced by the fact that over 66 percent of the total electorate of 834 million voted in the 2014 general elections. the depth and breadth of our democracy sparkles in the regular elections being held in our panchayati raj institutions. and yet, our legislatures lose sessions to disruptions when they should be debating and legislating on issues of importance. collective efforts must be made to bring the focus back to debate, discussion and decision-making., , 14.as our republic enters her sixty-eighth year, we must acknowledge that our systems are not perfect. the imperfections have to be recognized and rectified. the settled complacencies have to be questioned. the edifice of trust has to be strengthened. the time is also ripe for a constructive debate on electoral reforms and a return to the practice of the early decades after independence when elections to lok sabha and state assemblies were held simultaneously. it is for the election commission to take this exercise forward in consultation with political parties., , fellow citizens:, 15.in a fiercely competitive world, we have to work harder than ever to redeem the promises that we make to our people., , - we have to work harder because our war on poverty is not yet over. our economy is yet to grow at over 10 percent for an extended period of time to make a significant dent on poverty. one-fifth of our countrymen still remain below poverty line. gandhiji’s mission to wipe every tear from every eye still remains unfulfilled., , - we have to work harder to provide food security to our people and to make the agriculture sector resilient to the vagaries of nature. we have to provide better amenities and opportunities to our people in villages to ensure a decent quality of life., , - we have to work harder to provide enhanced employment opportunities to our youth through the creation of world-class manufacturing and services sectors. the competitiveness of the domestic industry has to be improved by focusing on quality, productivity and efficiency., , - we have to work harder to provide safety and security to our women and children. women must be able to lead their lives with honour and dignity. children must be able to enjoy their childhood to the fullest., , - we have to work harder to change our consumption pattern which has resulted in environmental and ecological de-gradation. we have to appease nature to prevent it from unleashing its fury in the form of floods, landslides and droughts., , - we have to work harder because our pluralistic culture and tolerance are still being put to test by vested interests. reason and moderation should be our guide in dealing with such situations., , - we have to work harder to keep at bay the dark forces of terrorism. these forces have to be dealt with firmly and decisively. the forces inimical to our interests cannot be allowed to grow., , - we have to work harder to ensure the well-being of our soldiers and security personnel who protect us from internal and external threats.,

2017-01-26,heed this 67-year-old tryst,"illustration: surendra , dear prime minister, warmest greetings to you on republic day., you were born the same year as our republic was. so, as the republic turns 67, you do too. twinned, by birth, to the constitution, you have with it another bond. as prime minister of india you have taken an oath, in the name of god, to ‘bear true faith and allegiance to the constitution of india’. and from that great position, you have called it india’s holy book. you are therefore, a constitution-person twice over, by birth and by oath., two and a half years after taking that oath, on this anniversary day, how do you see yourself in that bond?, you could, of course, say, “ask the people of india, they will tell you if i have or have not been true to it.” if i were to do that, i know, there would be a torrent of appreciation for you. not just the appreciation of your admirers but appreciation from objective observers as well., no one can deny the fact that between 2014 and 2017 your appeal has grown. it has grown for three reasons. first, you have been seen as decisive, a ‘doer’. second, you are perceived as having ‘taken on’ corruption. third, you are regarded as being tough, tougher than all your predecessors, on terror. there is a fourth image that must also be placed on the table, though it is not exactly complimentary. you are believed to be clever, hushiar. and your ‘at midnight tonight’ announcement on demonetisation has been seen as hushiari.“good for the country, no?” people said while queueing up the next morning in front of atms., but does being all those three — decisive, hard on corruption, tough on terror — translate into ‘bearing true faith and allegiance to the constitution’? today, on republic day, it is important that we reflect on that question., prime minister indira gandhi was a decisive woman. between 1975 and 1977 she was even more decisive than her usual decisive self. having declared a national emergency, she came down with an iron hand on people she portrayed as criminals, black-marketers, hoarders, corrupt. and terrorism, as we now know it, was absent during that period. but was indira gandhi true to her oath? you were 25 years old at the time, mr. prime minister. you will remember how when she reneged on the constitution, betrayed her oath, she was thrown out of power — lock, stock and barrel., indira was not india. no prime minister can be india. india alone is india., an impression prevails that you want to be seen as india, that criticism of you therefore amounts to criticism of india, tantamount to treason. questioning demonetisation becomes, in one flowing sequence, validating black money, going soft on terror and questioning your judgment — all anti-national. an immaculacy surrounds you, an assumption of infallibility imbues your pronouncements. and hence an aura of unquestionability., no one who is accountable to parliament, which represents all the people of india, can be a dictator or even a supremacist in the sense in which the word is normally used for one who wants to establish the superiority of a particular ethnicity, class or culture. but, mr. prime minister, you are a supremacist for your vision of india. you want your india, the india you are prime minister of, to do things that will be hailed as exceptional, unprecedented, unparalleled. you want india to reach, go beyond, mars, an indian land on the moon. you want to send more indian missiles hissing into the light blue skies than your predecessors did, more indian submarines to plumb noiselessly into the deep blue sea than your predecessors would have dreamt of. there is, at one level, something quite natural and admirable about a prime minister being ambitious for his or her country, to think big, bigger, biggest for his or her people. except when a nation’s leader believes in personal supremacism., sardar patel was not such a supremacist. he was a supreme realist., while supremacists love their own very particular crowds and those crowds love them, they are, as persons, very lonely. and loneliness finds two friends: secrecy and arbitrariness. a mist of trail-less circumstances surrounds a supremacist’s decisions. and these decisions come to be taken impulsively, whimsically. sometimes they can be inspired, but on most occasions they create more problems than they solve and can also cause havoc. isolated power is isolated from the advantages of consultation, from the benefit of an equal colleagueship. it is isolated, therefore, from the great bonus of republican partnership. so fond does he become of the dulcet tones of his own voice, that his auditory powers atrophy. even when he seems to be listening to others, the personal supremacist is, in fact, listening to his own voice reacting to what he is hearing. he is his own singer, his own song and his own listener. the self-centrism of an elected leader is, in democratic terms, an irony. in republican terms, an anomaly. it scarred the period 1975-1977. it must not, in the same or modified form, in de jure fact or in de facto spirit, be readmitted into our polity, our political culture., there are signs of it wanting to., abolishing the union planning commission, replacing independent heads of autonomous academic institutions by persons of known bias, the stalling of judges’ appointments, the superseding of generals in army promotions, of diplomats and bureaucrats in other elevations, the dangling in the air of the lokpal, the undermining of the rti act, blacklisting ngos, demonetisation, all come from the conviction,‘i am the alpha and the omega, the indus and the ganga’ of india. that, mr. prime minister, is an uninsured journey into great unknowns on a gilded ratha with mini-supremacists scrambling atop it., a political leader may, for all his egotism, be highly knowledgeable about certain things on his home ground. much more so than, for instance, his officers. no diplomat could have matched jawaharlal nehru’s understanding of international affairs. no officer, ics, ias, ips, could have matched patel’s knowledge of political psychology, chief minister pant’s understanding of rural politics, chief minister namboodiripad’s sense of rural and urban economics, chief minister kamaraj’s mastery of tamil nadu’s complex politics. but there are areas where others, experts, officers and ngos, know better, remember more than a politician. as, for instance, in fiscal planning, foreign relations, defence strategy, science and environment policy and, above all, in ‘real-life’ issues like unofficial ‘official’ extortions, job insecurity, health non-coverage, the absence of insurance and pension cover. the deference by non-expertise to experience becomes a leader., you advise us to do with less and less of cash. are you teaching us how to do with less and less of water? let atms run out of money, use cards, you tell us, use digi-dhan. what about when our lakes go dry? can we live with digi-jal? you are not warning the country of the known and unknown horrors of climate change, the power and fuel crises that await us, the pandemics, air-borne, water-borne and vector-borne, that are whirling overhead. you are telling us to be swachh but what of that behemoth source of aswachhata, our plastic lobby? you are teaching us the merits of yoga, but you are not disabling the fountainheads of ill-being in our gutka lobby, tobacco lobby. the control over our land commons, mines, forests by mafiosi, middlemen and mega ‘developers’ continues unchallenged., and then, there is kashmir. the team which, led by yashwant sinha and catalysed by wajahat habibullah, went to the valley has made searingly honest findings, vital recommendations. heed, mr. prime minister, their clear voice. had jayaprakash narayan’s warnings and guidance been heeded in the 1960s, kashmir would have been spared the agonies it is going through today. the constitution has not intended that part of our country for ceaseless bloodletting. history is giving us another chance for a bold new initiative that makes the most beautiful part of our nation its most peaceful., i said at the start that your appeal has grown. so has, in typical indian contrariness, your dis-appeal. those who believe in the core values of our constitution, though they are not bound to it by birth or oath, are deeply disturbed, dismayed, by the growing intolerance of dissent and the misrepresentation of criticism as anti-national.",0.16233841241266986,heed 67-year-old tryst,"illustration : surendra , dear prime minister , warmest greetings republic day. , born year republic was. , republic turns 67 , too. twinned , birth , constitution , another bond. prime minister india taken oath , name god , ‘bear true faith allegiance constitution india ’ . great position , called india ’ holy book. therefore , constitution-person twice , birth oath. , two half years taking oath , anniversary day , see bond?

inducted in combat streams of our armed forces. the nation is proud of its first three women fighter pilots. this reminds us of what we can achieve, as a nation, if women are fully empowered, and if their skills and talent are optimally utilised., 23. the beti bachao beti padhao scheme that addresses the issue of declining child sex ratio, is yielding encouraging results. under thesukanya samridhi yojana, launched with an objective of ensuring a secure future to our girl child, over one crore accounts have been opened and an amount of over rs. eleven thousand crore has been deposited. the pradhan mantri surakshit matritva abhiyan will provide comprehensive ante-natal care by a qualified medical practitioner to all pregnant women. the revision of maternity benefit act and

our greatest strength and yuva urja needs to be effectively channelised. with the motto of ""har haath ko hunar”, my government has taken several steps for skilling the youth and improving their employability. the work of skill development, that was earlier spread across 21 ministries and 50 departments, has been brought under one umbrella ministry. the pradhan mantri kaushal vikas yojana has

local area development for the betterment of the tribals and the poor inhabitants in the mining areas. district mineral foundation is a novel initiative in this regard., 34. my government has increased the allocation under the tribal sub-plan. fourteen different sectors have been identified under thevanbandhu kalyan yojanafor the empowerment of tribals. 100 out of the 300 clusters envisaged under the shyama prasad mukherjee rurban mission, will be developed in tribal areas., honourable members,, 35. the success of the indian cricket team at the world cup for the blind, 2014 and the indian paralympics contingent at rio 2016 demonstrates that our divyang jan can scale great heights, if afforded an opportunity. my government is committed to providing thedivyang jan equal opportunities for development. besides increasing the percentage of reservation for divyang jan from 3 to 4 percent in government jobs, my government has accelerated filling up of backlog vacancies.

identify regional support bases, assembly points and routes for evacuation; develop country-specific warden systems to communicate with expatriates; and establish evacuation priority and embarkation criteria., third, india’s diplomatic cadre must be given specific training to operate in hostile environments. as a senior government official told me, when it comes to operating in complex theatres, “practice and preparedness make perfection”., to achieve this, the government could instruct the police or army to train indian foreign service probationers to operate in war zones; conduct frequent evacuation simulations and emergency drills; and create rapid reaction teams of indian security personnel to be deployed to protect diplomatic staff and installations abroad., fourth, the success of future operations will also rely on new delhi’s willingness to work together with friendly governments. india will have to invest in cooperative frameworks that facilitate coordination among countries that have large expatriate populations in west asia, in particular nepal, bangladesh and sri lanka, and among leading powers with evacuation capacity in the indian ocean region., fifth, the government will have to assign a greater role to its armed forces, in particular by strengthening the navy and air force’s capacity to operate in tandem with civilian authorities. it should, for example, direct the military to develop a non-combatant evacuation (neo) doctrine, designate the integrated defence staff as the nodal organisation to improve inter-services and civil-military coordination, direct the services to conduct more multilateral neo exercises, and adapt military modernisation plans to increase capacity for out-of-area deployment and evacuation., sixth, to minimise redundancies, the government must institutionalise a permanent inter-ministerial coordinating mechanism for emergency evacuations, incentivise inter-agency cross-posting of officials dealing with diaspora affairs, and encourage state governments to create regional contingency plans., seventh, to avoid cost inflation and delays, the government must establish a permanent civil reserve air fleet that pools aircraft from all indian airlines based on pre-established requisition and reimbursement procedures., eighth, the government will have to invest in new technologies to better monitor the diaspora’s profile and mobility. this can be achieved by encouraging more diplomatic missions to provide online consular registration forms, developing an online registration system for overseas travellers, utilising social media, and by making the aadhaar card compulsory to facilitate biometric identity verification and reduce identity fraud during evacuation.",0.18498556998556995,"getting back home , safely","devising standard procedure : “in april 2015 , indian government successfully conducted operation raahat evacuate almost 5,000 indians 1,000 citizens 41 countries. ” evacuated indians getting india air force c-17 aircraft djibouti. &#124;

2017-03-16,gst laws ready for assemblies ,"the goods and services tax (gst) council has approved a 15% ceiling on the cess to be levied on aerated drinks and luxury cars over and above the maximum proposed gst rate of 28%. the enabling laws for state and union territories were also approved at the council’s meeting on thursday, paving the way for the adoption of the new indirect tax regime., while bidis have been kept out of the gst net, separate cess ceilings have been approved for pan masala and tobacco products, including chewing tobacco and cigarettes — keeping adequate provision to raise the effective rate from their existing levels., with the council having already cleared three other gst laws — pertaining to central gst, integrated gst and the compensation to be paid to states for loss of revenue — this paves the way for the centre and the states to pilot the new indirect tax system, proposed to be introduced from july 1, through parliament and the assemblies., “four of these laws have to be cleared by the centre in parliament, and will now be taken up by the union cabinet for their introduction and passage. we will try and do that expeditiously, and am sure that states would also try to expedite the state gst law by getting their respective cabinets to approve them,” finance, defence and corporate affairs minister arun jaitley said after the meeting. , apart from zero-rated goods, four tax rates of 5%, 12%, 18% and 28% have been proposed under the gst. the council on thursday approved the ceiling rates for the cess to be levied on top of the maximum gst rate of 28% on demerit or sin goods., “the cess is to be levied on four or five commodities and the caps have been approved by the council. for instance, the council has approved a cap of 15% cess on luxury cars, but that is only for empowerment. these cars are currently taxed at 40%, so the cess may only be around 12%,” the minister said., a similar 15% cess cap has been approved for aerated drinks as well, and revenue secretary hasmukh adhia said that any other item that the council decides to bring into the remit of the cess subsequently would attract the same ceiling rate of 15%. the environment cess on coal, lignite and peat has been capped at the existing rate of rs 400 per tonne., for pan masala, which currently face an effective tax rate of about 135%, the ceiling on cess has been kept at 135% on an ad valorem basis (value of the product). for cigarettes, which currently face a specific duty of rs 4,170 for every 1,000 sticks apart from vat and other taxes, the ceiling has been kept at 4,170 for every 1,000 sticks and 290% on an ad valorem basis, with the option to levy a combination of both. , pratik jain, indirect tax leader at pwc india said that industry still awaits clarity as to whether some of the existing cesses such as swachh bharat cess will continue to operate. , by the next weekend, officials are also expected to finalise four pending draft regulations relating to issues such as valuation under the gst regime, which will then be taken up by the gst council at its thirteenth meeting on march 31 in the capital, the minister said. five sets of regulations relating to payments and other issues have already been approved by the council., “after these rules are approved, one major action remains – the fitment of various commodities into

2017-03-31,is aadhaar a breach of privacy?,"aadhaar is very poorly designed. the technology needs fixing today; the law can wait for tomorrow, , sunil abraham, executive director at the centre for internet and society, aadhaar is mass surveillance technology. unlike, targeted surveillance which is a good thing, and essential for national security and public order — mass surveillance undermines security. and while biometrics is appropriate for targeted surveillance by the state — it is wholly inappropriate for everyday transactions between the state and law abiding citizens., when assessing a technology don't ask — “what use it is being put to today?”. instead ask “what use can it be put to tomorrow and by whom?”. the original noble intentions of the aadhaar project initiators will not constrain those in the future that want to take full advantage of technological possibilities. however, rather than frame the surveillance potential of aadhaar in a negative tone as three problem statements — i will propose three modifications that will reduce but not eliminate the surveillance potential., in january 2011, the centre for internet and society had written to the parliamentary finance committee that was reviewing what was then called the “national identification authority of india bill 2010”. we provided nine reasons for the government to stop using biometrics and instead use an open smart card standard. biometrics allows for identification of citizens even when they don't want to be identified. even unconscious and dead citizens can be identified using biometrics. smart cards which require pins on the other hand require the citizens' conscious cooperation during the identification process. once you flush your smart cards down the toilet nobody can use them to identify you. consent is baked into the design of the technology. if the uidai adopts smart cards, we can destroy the centralized database of biometrics just like the uk government did in 2010 under theresa may's tenure as home secretary. this would completely eliminate the risk of foreign government, criminals and terrorists using the breached biometric database to remotely, covertly and non-consensually identify indians., also readsc counters push for aadhaar , sc counters push for aadhaar, the aadhaar authentication regulations 2016 specifies that transaction data will be archived for five years after the date of the transaction. even though the uidai claims that this is a zero knowledge database from the perspective of “reasons for authentication” - any big data expert will tell you that it is trivial to guess what is going on using the unique identifiers for the registered devices and time stamps that are used for authentication. that is how they put rajat gupta and raj rajratnam in prison. there was nothing in the payload ie. voice recordings of the tapped telephone conversations – the conviction was based on meta-data. smart cards based on open standards allow for decentralized authentication by multiple entities and therefore eliminates the need for a centralized transaction database., we must as a nation get over our obsession with know your customer kyc. for example, for sim cards there is no kyc requirement is most developed countries. our insistence on kyc has only resulted in retardation of internet adoption, a black market for id documents and unnecessary wastage of resources by the telecos without preventing criminals and terrorists from using phones. where we must absolutely have kyc for security, elimination of ghosts and regulatory compliance – we must use a token issued by uidai instead of the aadhaar number. this would make it harder for unauthorized parties to combine databases. but at the same time would enable law enforcement agencies to combine database using the appropriate authorizations and infrastructure like natgrid. the natgrid unlike aadhaar is not a centralized database. it is a standard and platform for the express assembly of sub-sets of up to 20 databases which is then access by up to to 12 law enforcement and intelligence agencies., to conclude, even as a surveillance project — aadhaar is very poorly designed. the technology needs fixing today, the law can wait for tomorrow., , , aadhaar protects privacy by design. it uses the best possible technology relating to data protection, , r.s. sharma, is a chairman at trai. the views expressed are personal, since its inception, aadhaar has been criticised as a project which violates privacy. india does not have a law on privacy. in fact, then chairman of uidai, nandan nilekani, wrote to the prime minister as early as in may 2010 suggesting that there was a need to have a data protection and privacy law., in a digital world, search and aggregation of data have become relatively easy. aadhaar was designed as a digital identity platform which is inclusive, unique and can be authenticated to participate in any digital transaction. this has transformed the service delivery in our country, conveniencing residents and reducing leakages. direct benefit transfer, subscription to various services and authentication at the point of service delivery are some of the benefits which have accrued., aadhaar followed the principle of incorporating privacy by design, a concept which states that it projects should be designed with privacy in mind. collection of biometrics has often been quoted as one of the means of violating privacy. biometrics are essential to ensure uniqueness, a key requirement for this project. additionally, these biometrics can be used for authentication for financial transactions, getting mobile sims and various other services using electronic kyc (e-kyc)., also readgiving short shrift to children’s rights , giving short shrift to children’s rights , , another principle of privacy by design states that you should collect only minimal data. as uidai was creating identity infrastructure, it was decided that only a minimal set of data, just sufficient to establish identity, should be collected from residents. this irreducible set contained only four elements: name, gender, age and communication address of the resident., another design principle was to issue random numbers with no intelligence. this ensures that no profiling can be done as the number does not disclose anything about the person. the aadhaar act has clear restrictions on data sharing. no data download is permitted, search is not allowed and the only response which uidai gives to an authentication request is ‘yes’ or ‘no’. no personal information is divulged., when a biometric-based authentication takes place, it is the individual who must participate in the process by submitting his or her biometrics, typically at the service delivery point to prove his identity. typical examples are at the time of lifting ration from a pds shop, opening a bank account to provide ekyc to the bank or submission of digital life certificates by pensioners. the basic purpose of authentication is to facilitate residents in getting service in a digital, paperless and convenient way. as no information is divulged to any agency without the consent of the concerned individual, it cannot be construed to violate any privacy., besides the minimal data which uidai has about a person, it does not keep any data except the logs of authentication. it does not know the purpose of authentication. the transaction details remain with the concerned agency and not with uidai. this is the best model of keeping data where each data-owner has the responsibility of data confidentiality and security., aadhaar authentication and e-kyc ensures that documents cannot be misused. physical papers are amenable to misuse. we know of situations where multiple sims are issued based on some document, and the real owner is not even aware. on the other hand, e-kyc ensures that the document cannot be used for any other transaction. uidai has also built a facility wherein one can ‘lock’ the aadhaar number and disable it from any type of authentication for a period of one’s choice, guarding against any potential misuse., , , aadhaar is necessary but we also need a robust data privacy and data protection law, , baijayant jay panda, a lok sabha mp and frequently pens articles on socially relevant issues, i see many people taking what i call a black-and-white position on aadhaar. either they support or red-flag it. i am for aadhaar but i also feel very strongly about a robust data privacy and data protection law. as a matter of fact, a bill to this effect will be introduced by me in the lok sabha. having said that, i have for long maintained that aadhaar was the united progressive alliance government’s best idea; they were not enthusiastic about it and i wish they had done more. i am also glad that prime minister narendra modi, who had earlier opposed aadhaar, listened to nandan nilekani with an open mind and has emerged as its strongest votary., in my constituency and in other places which i visit frequently, i see enormous leakages in social schemes. aadhaar can plug these loopholes. i will quote former prime minister rajiv gandhi who said that out of every rupee spent by the indian government, barely 15 paisa reaches its citizens. a planning commission study done six years ago on the public distribution system found 27 paise reaching the citizens. the remaining 73 paise went on payments of salaries, administrative costs and corruption. mps are required to chair a quarterly review of their constituencies. i do this often and when i ask for an audit, i invariably discover that the district authorities are faced with large number of fake names or fake roll numbers, either for pds or the mid-day meal scheme. that’s where aadhaar can help. look at how aadhaar assured transparency in lpg allocations. of course, this was largely achieved by a concerned campaign spearheaded by the prime minister himself. similarly, there are states where pds has worked comparatively well, but not on all fronts. in odisha, the rice scheme by the chief minister has worked well but the same cannot be said about, say, kerosene distribution., also readwhat exactly is a money bill? , what exactly is a money bill? , while that’s one half of the debate, it is also true that we are rapidly becoming a digital economy. we are a nation of billion cell phones and yet we have antiquated laws for data protection and privacy. problems of id theft, fraud and misrepresentation are real concerns. we submit ourselves knowingly or unknowingly to personal information sought online, even without aadhaar. in the u.s., there is a legal battle on to make a case for better informed consent. let me give an analogy here. in the case of medical emergencies we are required to sign a consent form, often running into pages. in the u.s., it has been decided that it is not enough to sign the consent form; the doctor must explain to the patient the consequences of a medical procedure about to be performed., similarly, we need to educate people on the risks involved, and highlight examples of id thefts and fraud. we have a multiplicity of laws which overlap. our it laws have to be modernised and we have to put the liability on the company handling the data so that it is not stolen or shared without consent.",0.0669957264957265,aadhaar breach privacy ?,"aadhaar poorly designed. technology needs fixing today ; law wait tomorrow , , sunil abraham , executive director centre internet society ,

2017-03-31,it’s time for africa ,"after a teenage boy went missing in greater noida on march 26, locals accused five nigerian students of cannibalism. residents of the enclave barged into the home where the nigerian students were staying and searched the fridge for the remains of the youth, who died in a hospital after being found in a nearby park. following unsubstantiated complaints from the victim’s family, the police charged the students with murder but did not detain them for lack of evidence. it was later reported that the boy died of drug overdose. this incident, followed by further violence against african students in noida, marks a new low in the racism faced by africans in india., this vicious race crime is a clear sign of terrible ignorance, arrogance and the recycling of old tropes of africans as “uncivilised”. indians, with their preference for “whiteness” and their total lack of information and exposure to africa’s rich cultural heritage and its contemporary politics, have denied africans in india their basic humanity which is demonstrated in their accusations of “cannibalism” — the ultimate denouncement of the “inhuman other”., there have been several atrocious cases of racism in the last year towards africans in india. masonda ketada olivier, a young congolese man who was a french teacher in south extension, was murdered while returning home from a party when he tried to get an autorickshaw home and got into an argument with three men who wanted to hire the vehicle. he was brutally pulled out of the auto, assaulted, and struck on the head with a stone. he was rushed to the aiims trauma centre but was pronounced dead on arrival., also readattack on nigerians puts greater noida on alert , attack on nigerians puts greater noida on alert , the aggravated hate crimes against africans are not limited to delhi and its environs. three months before the olivier tragedy, a 21-year-old tanzanian woman was driving in bengaluru when a mob stopped the car, dragged her out, beat her and stripped off her shirt. local papers reported that the police stood by while she was beaten and paraded around naked. the car was set ablaze., apparently the young tanzanian student was beaten to avenge the death of a woman who had allegedly been run over by a sudanese man less than an hour before the attack. the student pleaded with the police for help insisting she had nothing to do with the fatal accident. in her filed complaint, she alleged that a policeman told her: “you all look alike and you should get the black man who ran over a woman in the area.”, while these monstrous incidents hit the headlines, africans in india face everyday racism that makes them feel very unsafe. the attitude of the police reflects and exacerbates this racial violence and discrimination. african students are mostly left to protest the hate crimes, and the government, keen to placate the african governments, offers the obligatory sorry and promises to look into the incident and bring about justice. however, no serious attempts to address racism towards africans in india have been undertaken., there were 42,420 foreign students in india in 2016. the top sending countries were nepal (21.3%), afghanistan (10.3%), bhutan, (6.6%), sudan (4.8%), nigeria (4.7%), indicating that after the three saarc partner countries, sudan and nigeria send the most students to study in india. students come from many african countries to india as many universities offer quality education in english that is much more reasonably priced than in the west. the university of mysore, for instance, has 2,000 foreign students, many from african countries., thus indian students have an opportunity to meet african students and learn about a part of the world of which they know little. this is despite the fact that india has had trading connections with africa over the centuries and many people of indian descent live and have lived in africa for centuries., nana peasah, a ghanaian student, has returned recently to accra after studying at the university of mysore for two years. he was the international students’ co-coordinator at the university in 2015-16. he sought to learn about india and joined the rotary club east of mysore. he also attended the destiny international church, a pentecostal church, where many international students are made to feel welcome. while mr. peasah had a lot of foreign student friends from around the world, it was harder to make friends with indian students. to make friends with women students was almost impossible, as indian men were quick to accuse africans of making advances at ‘their’ women even if they were merely studying together., also readthe gaze says it all , the gaze says it all, concerned

university of mysore joined the peace march, mr. peasah appreciated the fact that over 40 students came in a bus from vikram nursing school to join it and even provided first aid back-up support for the walkers., mr. peasah thinks it is critical that proper orientation be given to african students coming to study in india. it is perhaps as or more critical for indian students and members of

2017-04-23,mistaking symbolism for service ,"every so many days, prime minister narendra modi reminds us about swachh bharat abhiyan. to this end, he has often communicated the (unaudited) achievements of his government and the urgency of the issue. last week, on the 100th anniversary of the champaran satyagraha, mr. modi argued that there was now a need for a ‘swachhagraha’, by which he presumably meant a commitment to cleanliness as a way of being. much as ‘truth’ in satyagraha is not reducible to a simple act of fact-verification but is an outcome of private strivings, ‘cleanliness’ in any idea of ‘swachhagraha’ is arguably not an one-off activity. civic cleanliness becomes an emergent characteristic that a society arrives at by internalising a set of actions, duties, and processes till the collective memory of the nation can imagine things in no other way., for mahatma gandhi, the idea of radical truth-telling was a totalising pre-condition to political life. arguably, in mr. modi’s political vocabulary, cleanliness occupies a similar analytical and emotional perch. it is a private action, a public policy, and an intellectual framework that allows him to draw out causal relationships between india’s ills — from lack of toilets for women to river pollution — and india’s future. his thesis is that if we can get cleanliness right, much else will follow. a nation, per this view, can’t be modern and powerful unless it is clean., this isn’t a new idea. in the 1960s, the former prime minister of singapore, lee kuan yew, took to the streets with a broom to spur the citizens into action. in france, a national zeal for epurations or purifications, including washing away the moral pollution of some who collaborated with the nazis, took hold after the second world war. brothels were shut, soap and detergents entered homes, newly founded women’s magazines now exalted clean underwear as much as patriotism. cleanliness moved from being a moral virtue to a functional attribute of being modern. an elaborate infrastructure of cleanliness, physical and cultural, was produced thanks to what roland barthes describes as “a great hunger for cleanliness”., however, in modi’s india, unlike de gaulle’s france, there is no public spur like the second world war to galvanise an entire country into action. nor is india a micro state like lee kuan yew’s singapore with the abilities to enforce a penalty-based regime. instead, among india’s great challenges is translating an inchoate recognition that civic cleanliness matters into a programme of collective action. any and all change can only come if there is a citizens’ movement.",0.14389786570019125,mistaking symbolism service,"every many days , prime minister narendra modi reminds us swachh bharat abhiyan. end , often communicated ( unaudited ) achievements government urgency issue. last week , 100th anniversary champaran satyagraha , mr. modi argued need ‘swachhagraha ’ , presumably meant commitment cleanliness way being. much ‘truth ’ satyagraha reducible simple act fact-verification outcome private strivings , ‘cleanliness ’ idea ‘swachhagraha ’ arguably one-off activity. civic cleanliness becomes emergent characteristic society arrives internalising set actions , duties , processes till collective memory nation imagine things way. , mahatma gandhi , idea radical truth-telling totalising pre-condition political life. arguably , mr. modi ’ political vocabulary , cleanliness occupies similar analytical emotional perch. private action , public policy , intellectual framework allows draw causal relationships india ’ ills — lack toilets women river pollution — india ’ future. thesis get cleanliness right , much else follow. nation , per view , ’ modern powerful unless clean. , ’ new idea. 1960s , former prime minister singapore , lee kuan yew , took streets broom spur citizens action. france , national zeal epurations purifications , including washing away moral pollution collaborated nazis , took hold second world war. brothels shut , soap detergents entered homes , newly founded women ’ magazines exalted clean underwear much patriotism. cleanliness moved moral virtue functional attribute modern. elaborate infrastructure cleanliness , physical cultural , produced thanks roland barthes describes “a great hunger cleanliness ” . , however , modi ’ india , unlike de gaulle ’ france , public spur like second world war galvanise entire country action. india micro state like lee kuan yew ’ singapore abilities enforce penalty-based regime. instead , among india ’ great challenges translating inchoate recognition civic cleanliness matters programme collective action. change come citizens ’ movement .","{'bjp': 0, 'cong': 0}",0,0
2017-04-30,aadhaar concerns and some consolation,"sometimes it seems very few people know what aadhaar is all about. so there is a need to explain what it is and dispel some risk perceptions, while confirming others., first up, what is aadhaar? in essence it is a number. the card’s job is only to record the number., how does this number help? it means any place that is equipped with biometric verification linkage with the uidai database can verify that i am indeed who i say i am. it’s an identity proof – the number together with biometrics. that is all it is., once a number is assigned to a “name-biometrics” combination, all other names a person has used become inoperative, in theory. all official documents will eventually need to be matched and, where necessary, rectified and reissued. it might involve phenomenal cost, but that is another story., what makes aadhaar secure? basic personal security in the tech world depends on two elements. first is what you “have”. the second is what you “know”. for the system to work well at least one of the two must be unavailable to others. for a smart card, the “card is what you have” and a “pin is what you know”. for a bank account, a “login id is what you have”, and a “password is what you know”. a card number or a bank id is seldom secret. it is the loss of a pin or password to theft, guesswork, phishing, hacking or cracking that makes them vulnerable., in the case of aadhaar the “number you know” is like the email address or credit card number or bank account number. regardless of what the government says, it is impossible to keep the uidai database secure and immune to hacking or leaking. so one way or another your number is what you know, but so do a lot of people and it is not a secret., on the other hand, personal biometrics is “what you have” and only you do. the god-given password cannot be stolen. the card is a simple mnemonic device and you can happily lose it, so long as you have a record of the number. duplicate or even fake cards can be produced with rudimentary technology and at virtually no cost. so, free advice to all authorities or entities using the card alone to check identity: don’t do it unless you have biometric verification connectivity to uidai., it follows that stealing someone’s aadhaar number or card will not do the thief any good, unless he can fake biometric presentation. it can be done but there are technical-financial barriers., all that the aadhaar system can thus legitimately, and accurately, do is to establish identity. many commentators have criticised aadhaar for not doing other things, which it is not and was never meant to do., first, aadhaar is not “proof of address” although it does have a “recorded address”. no effort has been put in to make it “proof”. addresses being a variable, it is not even feasible. organisations accepting it as address proof will soon wake up to the fact that their communications or even financial benefits do not reach the target if they misreported their address or moved. people who lose benefits or important communications will correct their recorded address — a fairly simple process., second, aadhaar is not “proof of nationality”. no resources have gone into establishing that link. nor was it ever within the uidai mandate. it is now linked to passports applications because it can eliminate multiple passports being issued to a person under different names., the same objective of de-duplication is behind most other linkages, be it driving licences, lpg connections, pan cards or what have you. all this can only benefit the country including those who cry themselves hoarse at every new linking. can anyone use your aadhaar to get your it returns or financial transactions? not any more easily than without it., there is also criticism of third-party use – reliance jio, for example, uses aadhaar as the sole customer registration tool. this should in fact be praised and encouraged — it cuts out all paperwork while completing know your customer norms. every private or public party should be able to ascertain that the person they are dealing with is who he says he is.",0.07033300033300034,aadhaar concerns consolation,"sometimes seems people know aadhaar about. need explain dispel risk perceptions , confirming others. , first , aadhaar ?

2017-05-05,tamil nadu cities slip in swachh ranking,"tiruchi is the only city from the state to gure in the top ten in the swachh survekshan 2017 ranking, but slipped from third to sixth position. , the swachh survekshan 2017 ranking, released for 434 towns and cities across the country by the union ministry of urban development on thursday, has not brought cheer to tamil nadu. while coimbatore has moved a couple of notches up to 16, tiruchi has slipped to sixth position from third. the city had stood second in 2015. , madurai is ranked 57, down from the previous year’s 26, and greater chennai plummeted to 235, from 36. against four in 2016, 28 towns and cities from tamil nadu participated in the survey this year. the highest rank of six has gone to tiruchi, while rameswaram is ranked 268, the lowest among cities in the state., tiruchi is the only city from tamil nadu to figure in the top ten, scoring 1,716 out of 2,000 points. it secured 728 points more than the national average of 988 and 536 more than the state average of 1180. coimbatore scored 1,650 points, against the previous year’s 1,361. tiruchi scored well in four categories — citizen feedback, onsite observation, open defecation free/toilets, and capacity building initiatives. its score was low in solid waste collection and transportation, solid waste processing and disposal, and municipal self-declaration. officials in coimbatore said that however high the corporation rated its service level, it was not able to get a positive response from the people. around 50% of respondents were unhappy with its solid waste management., officials do not want to look at the ranking as a reflection of their commitment. in 2016, 73 towns and cities were ranked while the number swelled to 434 in 2017. “we feel happy. we have lost the first place to indore by just 91 points. if we had done well in citizen feedback, tiruchi would have emerged on top,” said n. ravichandran, tiruchi corporation commissioner. this year, cities with over one lakh population had been included in the survey. this meant more competition from cities with fewer people and lesser waste, said coimbatore commissioner k. vijayakarthikeyan. “when compared to last year, we have improved this time. we shall work hard to get into the top 10,” said sandeep nanduri, madurai commissioner., an apparent let-up in attending to solid waste management proved costly for salem, which is ranked 135. the low ranking requires the corporation to calibrate its strategy accordingly, say ngos. salem corporation does not have a proper garbage disposal system. it has proposed to construct a garbage processing unit and four pre-processing units as well as buy adequate dustbins, pushcarts, compactors etc. failure to effectively implement anti-plastic drive has chocked drains., there are others who are disappointed at the ranking. officials of tirunelveli corporation, who implemented a novel system of plastic waste collection, only on wednesdays, and facilitated conversion of degradable waste into manure, could not understand why it was ranked 193. rank 108 is a disappointment for vellore. an official observed that they expected to stand in the top 50. “what is lacking in vellore is citizen involvement. we do not get views or comments from the public,” he said. , the case of greater chennai corporation, which is ranked 235 owing to inadequate waste collection, lack of scientific solid waste processing, delay in construction of toilets and poor communication to bring about behaviour change, is different. , “the team visited the city a few days after cyclone vardah. everything was in shambles. so our ranking dipped,” said an official. many of the markets, places of worship and public places, including the marina, were not clean during the visit of the team. chennai received a score of 916 out of 2000., according to data from the chennai corporation, 571 of the 866 toilets were damaged during the visit of the team. the civic body prepared estimates for restoration of toilets at ₹5.71 crore but just 47 were repaired and most of them were not clean, leading to a poor score. officials

2017-05-08,how equal is the internet?,"ramesh srinivasan believes that these are problematic times for the digital world. it’s in the loss of sovereignty or control of data that users of major platforms such as facebook and google face. , an it activist and associate professor at ucla, srinivasan explores the relationship between technologies—internet, mobile telephony, social media—and the diverse cultures of the world. he has worked extensively with native american communities in bolivia, new mexico and the us, with revolutionaries in egypt and tribal communities in india. these communities can introduce a new way forward, he believes, whereby the internet can better serve and support diverse cultures as well as grassroot politics., his activism, he says, is more about justice, equality and human rights. in his recently-launched book, whose global village? rethinking how technology shapes our world, to be published in india by sage publications india in the coming months and already out globally via nyu press, srinivasan writes about the concentration of it in the hands of a few silicon valley companies, the pushing down of curated information and of the marginalisation of non-users of technology. excerpts from an interview:, in whose global village... you write about the technological revolution not being global. what do you mean?, the book makes the argument that the new technology revolution is not cross-cultural, and hence not global in a fundamentally democratic manner that respects equality and diversity. out of 6-7 billion people in the world, about 4 billion have internet access. out of this, half, that is roughly 1.8 billion, use facebook and google. these platforms come from silicon valley, and therefore reflect the biases of western thinking. companies and technologies developed in a very small part of the world become the face of the internet, so do the biases of those designers and knowledge traditions. in the process, other cultural voices, particularly those with less power over technology design, are completely sidelined. , i was recently invited by unesco to cameroon, and before proceeding i searched for cameroon on google. the page i found was a cia world fact book. i could not find how people in cameroon talk about themselves., twenty years ago, we used to browse the net, and even called it ‘surfing’, but now information is pushed down to you. we see examples in the us and worldwide, of how data gathered about people, including online, can manipulate ‘fake news’ and political content that diffuses on facebook. yet, some of us may not even be aware of this, since we are trapped in our own ‘filter bubbles’ and ‘echo chambers’., are you saying the voices of the silicon valley companies are biased?, i am saying the world right now is facing a loss of cultural diversity and language. we have to think of an internet that is not complicit with this, of a technology that supports the diversity of our world rather than flatten it. , the cover of whose global village | photo credit: special arrangement , the second problem, as i said, is data. data is the oil of the new economy. so much data is being collected and in so many capacities. almost anything one does has a digital trace. this data can be sold. data is on your credit or aadhar card, sometimes you are tracked by sensors, by surveillance cameras, and sometimes you just give up your data wilfully online. all of this can be gathered, retained, aggregated and used to shape your experience, which can then influence political identity. edward snowden made a point—even when you are offline, data can be sent. why are people being forced on these systems? it is simple; because it makes a lot of money for the companies involved. it empowers the state and corporate gatekeepers to have power over the individual and the community., you work with communities around the globe. do you think they would be better off if they were digitally mainstream?, currently, i am working with the zapotec communities in the cloud forest area in south mexico, who are creating their own technology networks to support their languages and economic and political values. the community has a diversity of dozens of languages. they want digital connectivity on their own terms. i think on some level, the world can learn from projects like this., but the internet is architecturally decentralised?, it is decentralised but politically hierarchical. whatsapp is encrypted, but from whom? facebook bought whatsapp. one can say the same about instagram, for example, which was sold for over a billion us dollars with just 13 employees, while many other companies, such as kodak, that hired thousands, were going bankrupt., this is a huge macroeconomic and labour issue, compounded by the emergence of ais (artificial intelligence systems) that are going to displace even further human labour. we need new progressive models for ethical and just labour in the digital economy., do you offer any solutions?",0.07412956787956787,equal internet ?,"ramesh srinivasan believes problematic times digital world. ’ loss sovereignty control data users major platforms facebook google face. , activist associate professor ucla , srinivasan explores relationship technologies — internet , mobile telephony , social media — diverse cultures world. worked extensively native american communities bolivia , new mexico us , revolutionaries egypt tribal communities india. communities introduce new way forward , believes , whereby internet better serve support diverse cultures well grassroot politics. , activism , says , justice , equality human rights. recently-launched book , whose global village ?

2017-05-25,modi’s image will help bjp expand footprint in south india: amit shah,"bjp president amit shah addressing party workers in vijayawada on thursday. | photo credit: v. raju , bjp president amit shah is on a whirlwind 95 day tour of the country for organisational mobilisation of the party in areas of strength and weakness. nistula hebbar catches up with him in the midst of a heatwave in telangana., there are achievements in every field as far as the narendra modi government is concerned. we are the fastest growing economy and we have been able to control inflation, agriculture has also shown adequate growth, foreign reserves have gone up. the release of 104 satellites recently, we have made a place for ourselves in space technology. but the biggest achievement of the modi government has been that the country’s self confidence has grown. the direction of its growth has been made clear and the scale of the vision for the country has grown. for example, even after 70 years there are 14,000 villages with no electricity, we don’t decide that 1000 or 2000 villages will be electrified, but that not a single village should remain without electricity, not a single home without a bank account, that in the next five years five crore households will be provided cooking gas. the scale of narendra modiji’s vision has impacted the achievements of this government, as well as the people’s expectation from its leadership. and it is this expectation and the political will of the leadership by modiji which generates achievements., in the field of defence, the decision to go through with surgical strikes has made the entire world change the way it looks at india, that the modi government is firm in its actions and this image has been established. it is a decisive government, that backs its army. both the army and the central government have indicated by these actions that not only do they care about the safety of our borders but also the honour of our soldiers. tuesday’s action has raised not just the morale of the indian army but also the entire country., there is a difference in the way that pink papers defines economic reforms and the way that the government led by narendra modiji does. for me this government has done its utmost to positively affect the gdp through acts that liberate the economic potential of our most disadvantaged citizens. it has been transformative in its approach. for example, if you build a toilet in a house where the young girls there had no access to it and feared for their safety everyday, or you provide cooking gas to a woman who spends hours in a day collecting firewood and toiling in a smoky kitchen, it is a liberation of a most basic sort, one that truly empowers them. the economic reforms that this government has undertaken taken has been more than what any government has done in the last 22 years. decisive steps have been taken towards a transparent economy through gst, the jan dhan yojana, direct benefit transfer (dbt) through aadhar. it has been aligned with schemes like ujjwala yojana, mudra, crop insurance, e-markets which are reforms geared at access to institutional credit and public services., it is easy to be dismissive of this decision as it was a huge one with manifold ramifications. to demonetise a huge load of currency of 1.25 billion people was a courageous thing. as far as what it’s achieved is concerned, the huge amount of currency hidden away in the homes of the corrupt, even political leaders is now in the system, and is available for use in development schemes. today no one can say that the money is outside the system, and tracking and trailing of black money arising out of this exercise is going on. other than that, for 91 lakh pan cards to be issued in one year, is an effect of demonetisation. the rise of 18% in direct and indirect in the space of a single year is an effect of demonetisation. and i believe, in the coming days, that the budgets of both the union and state governments will go up by over one and a half times thanks to demonetisation and the imperative of doing business in white economy due to the gst., i do say this, because i believe that without ideology any political party becomes just a machine to win elections and ultimately it does not do any good to the country and people., i am referring to many such parties. those that abandon ideology are reduced purely to an election winning machine. the bjp was established because we believed in a certain ideology and from the jan sangh to the janata party, and the reason for parting ways from the janata party was purely ideological. today, we have been able to establish a different path in governance at the centre and in the various states where we have a government because of ideology., for me the word area is a bigger conception for me than just states that you are alluding to. for example, the bjp is strong in gujarat, we haven’t lost a single assembly poll in the last 22 years, but we want to strengthen the party in the booths that we have lost in these polls. in uttar pradesh, at the moment we are in a good position, but there are many booths where the bjp lost, where we want to strengthen. having said that, i am spending 24 days in the south including lakshadweep, telangana, and tamil nadu and i believe that people will support the bjp in the south in a big way in the coming days., the bjp is an all india party. in tamil nadu, our party will be made up of our leaders and workers from the state, so where is the question of a cultural gap?, if language, culture and food could divide us, we would not be a nation. the core of india is bharatiyata, which is above all other cultural differences., the poor face similar problems in north, east and south. the way the modi government has worked for poor in last three years, bjp has become the favourite party for all marginalized sections which includes dalits, tribals and farmers. i am confident that this image of modi ji will help us expanding our party in south as well other regions of the country. our party work will be taken forward by leaders and workers from the state, so where is the question of a cultural gap? i am spending 24 days in the south including lakshadweep, telangana, and tamil nadu and i believe that people will support the bjp in the south in a big way in the coming days. , rajnikantji has expressed a wish to enter politics. i have said earlier also that good people should enter politics and he is welcome if he chooses to do so. as far as joining the bjp is concerned, we have not had any such conversation., we have not interfered in the party at all. the vaccum that was created after the sad demise of jayalalithaji has resulted in the party’s internal disputes to surface. that is the issue. it has nothing to do with the bjp., we don’t expect the issue to last for long. we expect it to be resolved much before the polls are around., that is something only nitish kumarji can decide. we haven’t received any such signals from him till now., we are speaking to our nda partners and will be talking to other parties too, after which a candidate will emerge.",0.10805650489861013,modi ’ image help bjp expand footprint south india : amit shah,"bjp president amit shah addressing party workers vijayawada thursday.

2017-06-30,the task before the sentinel: privacy challenges to aadhaar,"getty images/istockphoto | photo credit: mrjub , the expansion of aadhaar continues. the effort is now emboldened by a supreme court judgment that has stuck a band-aid on a gaping wound, which required stitches if not surgery. individual holdouts against aadhaar have been recognised and grudgingly protected by the judgment. there is, however, no broad declaration against an overpowering state’s propensity to stretch out to every sphere to compel individual surrender of little remnants of liberty. the architecture of enforced surveillance has been left intact., aadhaar is a classic case of technology being amoral. the splitting of the atom gave us nuclear energy. it also gave us weapons with the capacity to destroy civilisation. similarly, the unique identification authority of india (uidai) began only with the mandate to confirm a citizen’s unique identity. a stand-alone authority, with biometric information and fingerprints, which could, in cases of doubt, identify with certainty any claimant of government subsidies or special services. aadhaar’s claim was to weed out duplicates and forgeries, thus ensuring targeted distribution by administrations., aadhaar’s sole purpose was as a benign guarantor of identity in cases of doubt. any attempt by government departments to overreach this mandate was resisted by the authority. in fact, when a court ordered access to the database for a police investigation in a criminal matter, the aadhaar authority challenged the order in the supreme court., also readhow to link aadhaar with pan , how to link aadhaar with pan, however, the uidai database has today ceased to be only a neutral identifier of a person’s identity. in the information age, where data is the new oil, the temptation to maximise the use of an all-encompassing database is simply too strong. more and more service providers sought linkages to the data and the government ramped up the number of government and other organisations that could insist on an aadhaar-based identity alone as a sine qua non for dealing with the user. shortly after the supreme court’s recent judgment of june 9, 2017, the government publicised a prior notification of june 1, 2017, under the prevention of money laundering act (pmla). the notification makes it mandatory for bank account holders to produce an aadhaar number., the government has also deliberately misconstrued an earlier supreme court order in order to pressurise telecom operators to make aadhaar a requirement for all mobile phone users. even education and health services have been used to broaden the aadhaar net and draw in more people into the dragnet. schools insist on newly admitted children having aadhaar numbers, which are not given until the parents too submit to aadhaar registration., there are reports that the civil aviation ministry wants to make aadhaar identification mandatory for access to commercial flights. the government has decided to make the cost of holding out unbearable to the non-compliant and present courts with a fait accompli., fundamental freedoms of the individual are being routinely sacrificed at the altar of administrative expediency and the forced sacrifice is justified as being necessary for the greater common good. not since the forced sterilisations during the emergency has a government been so invested in an administrative goal that it has abandoned the requirement to seek “the consent of the governed”. a key to access government services has turned into a prison lock of individual liberties. an all-powerful state seems today to seek “one ring to rule them all, one ring to find them, one ring to bring them all, and in the darkness bind them”., how then is this darkness to be dispelled? how are the lords of the rings to be brought back to democratic governance? the processes have to be both political and legal. the mahatma as a leader was born in 1907 when an indian barrister in transvaal refused to register himself as a lesser inhabitant of south africa. it is time for all political parties, including the bharatiya janata party, to take a relook at the extent of control that aadhaar gives to governments against the citizen. today’s government is tomorrow’s opposition, and vice versa. every party must seriously ponder the possibility that its worst opponents may one day use this technology against it., the congress, which fathered the scheme, is now coming to the slow realisation of the surveillance possibilities that it has handed over to its successor. sitaram yechury of the communist party of india (marxist) has also raised concerns during the parliamentary debates held after the aadhaar legislation was rushed through as a money bill. a sustained parliamentary inquiry committee, spanning various ministries, should be used to rein in the system’s worst excesses. every new administrative measure designed to be aadhaar-reliant should seek prior approval from this parliamentary committee., it has been almost 700 days since the supreme court on august 11, 2015, referred the privacy challenges to aadhaar to a larger bench of possibly nine judges. the court needs to rule on whether the right to privacy is an established part of the fundamental right to life and liberty in this country. this is because, at a hearing before three judges, attorney general mukul rohatgi had contended that because of judgments of the “court in m.p. sharma & others v. satish chandra & others, air 1954 sc 300 and kharak singh v. state of u.p. & others, air 1963 sc 1295 (decided by eight and six judges, respectively), the legal position regarding the existence of the fundamental right to privacy is doubtful.” he therefore contended that the “right to privacy” deemed to be accepted by subsequent smaller benches “resulted in a jurisprudentially impermissible divergence of judicial opinions”., the court further records its “opinion that the cases on hand raise far reaching questions of importance involving interpretation of the constitution. what is at stake is the amplitude of the fundamental rights including that precious and inalienable right under article 21. if the observations made in m.p. sharma (supra) and kharak singh (supra) are to be read literally and accepted as the law of this country, the fundamental rights guaranteed under the constitution of india and more particularly right to liberty under article 21 would be denuded of vigour and vitality. at the same time, we are also of the opinion that the institutional integrity and judicial discipline require that pronouncement made by larger benches of this court cannot be ignored by the smaller benches without appropriately explaining the reasons for not following the pronouncements made by such larger benches”.",0.038651090470710726,task sentinel : privacy challenges aadhaar,"getty

2017-07-04,removing the dark spots,"like in all metros, garbage is a major challenge in bengaluru too. even as concerned agencies continue to grapple with it, few community-led private initiatives trying to resolve the issue have come up on the horizon. in bengaluru, youth for parivartan (yfp) was born two months before swachh bharat abhiyaan came into force to deal with mounting garbage issues in the city., amit amarnath, a resident of banashankari ii stage, had for long seen a park in the vicinity turned into a garbage dump. children didn’t have any place to play and neighbours complained. but, nobody did anything until one day in june 2014, when amit and his friends restored the park back to its glory. that is when yfpwas born. today it has about 1,000 members who lead cleanliness initiatives across the city. they fix black spots which could be beneath a flyover, a wall spoilt with urination, parks and corners turned into garbage dumps. the volunteers clean up the place, beautify it and if the space permits, even construct a bench of cement and bricks., if you come across terracotta painted walls with beautiful trees and other imageries painted in warli art anywhere in the city, know that yfp is behind it. “we have observed that if you beautify a space, people don’t dirty it and that is what we work around with,” says koushik dhayal, a student, who is the brain behind the warli paintings adorning walls., till now, the outfit comprising students and professionals, has undertaken 94 spot fixes. “people also call up and inform and at times, if we come across something, we take it up,” says shravani, a core team member of yfp. while the attitude of people is changing now, it was not easy to deal with in the beginning. “i think swachh bharat abhiyaan helped a lot in this direction. people became positive and encouraging towards us. in fact, now they try to help us,” adds pratham, another core team member of yfp., the sites cleaned up by the outfit hardly get dirty again reveals koushik. “our success rate is 80-90%. and it is because the community takes interest in it and is able to sustain,” he notes., but still every spot is not exactly a cakewalk, like the mysore bank circle. it took them around three visits to ensure that the place remains filth free. “urination was a serious problem there. we washed the whole place and then painted but it didn’t work and the problem persisted. then we painted the karnataka flag but even then it continued. and recently, we painted portraits of rajkumar and br ambedkar and the problem has stopped,” quips pratham adding that after a while bbmp has now even installed dustbins at the location., the members revisit the spot 10 days after fixing it. a huge effort went into fixing the national college flyover. about 250-300 members worked for 12 hours to remove the numerous posters and then painted it. how it works is that the team members first visit the spot, evaluate it, fix a date or time on weekends and then inform volunteers on their whatsapp group or website to join for the task.",-0.0093294051627385,removing dark spots,"like metros , garbage major challenge bengaluru too. even

2017-08-21,signs of change to come in delhi,"where to go next? view of the road sign is obstructed by foliage on vikas marg in east delhi. , an experienced driver, raghav swears by google maps, memory and pedestrians for destination-based information in the capital. the 24-year-old, who has been driving at least 20 km daily for the past five years, cannot recall the last time he looked at road signage for directions or information., “road signage is either hidden behind dense foliage, obscured behind poles/ wires or mounted at places not easily visible. this, especially in case of signage on speed limit. my licence once got suspended for three months for driving 10 km per hour over the speed limit. at that point, i had been driving on that road for nearly one year. i never spotted any speed limit signage before or after i was penalised. most signage exist because they must and exist without application of mind,” he said., however, woes regarding road signage may come to an end by this new year’s eve, thanks to lieutenant-governor anil baijal’s directions to road-owning agencies to overhaul the existing network of road signage in the capital., spot the difference: a speed-limit sign in a blue square at kirti nagar in west delhi. , the public works department (pwd) and civic agencies, including the municipal corporations of delhi, have been given a seemingly ambitious deadline to standardise the road signage that have remained more or less unchanged for close to a decade., the pwd and civic agencies have been directed to oversee and complete a pan-city road signage maintenance, rectification and installation exercise, last taken up in the run up to the 2010 commonwealth games, by the end of the year., “a survey to ascertain lacunae in road signage already installed on delhi roads, irrespective of jurisdiction of land-owning agencies, is underway for the first time since the commonwealth games. not just the survey, but installation of new and maintenance of existing road signs is being taken up simultaneously since we do not want to waste time waiting for the survey results. mr. baijal has set december 31 as the deadline for completion of the exercise,” said a delhi government source., according to the source, apart from installation of both indicative and warning signs where none exist, new boards displaying the identity and contact details of local councillors and mlas will also be part of the exercise. efforts are underway to audit the correctness of road details and spelling mistakes in road signs employing languages other than english, such as hindi and urdu., spot the difference: a speed-limit sign set inside a yellow square on rafi marg in central delhi , over 70% of road signage, traffic signals and road markings in the city do not follow the prescribed norms, a study released on june 28 by the institute of road traffic education (irte) revealed., as per the delhi government records, the total road network in 2015-16 comprised 33,868 lane km. as many as six agencies are responsible for maintaining the capital’s ever-expanding road network. this network is divided into jurisdictions of the pwd, which has 1,280 km; the south delhi municipal corporation’s 9,408 km; the east delhi civic body’s 270 km; the north delhi civic body’s 3,118 km; the new delhi municipal council’s 1,290 km; national highways with 430 km; the dsiidc’s 1,434 km; the delhi development authority’s 435 km; other roads which comprise 6,308 km; and land belonging to other agencies., while the pwd is responsible for roads over 60-metre in width, roads less than 60-m wide broadly fall under the jurisdictions of the civic bodies; other land-owning agencies have different patterns of road ownership depending on notified demarcation., the study, released by irte president rohit baluja, showed that of 1,514 signage examined across 14 major stretches in delhi, 1,098 did not meet the standards prescribed by the indian road congress (irc)., , the study revealed that around 93% of regulatory signage, which are meant to be mandatorily followed, violated the prescribed standards of size, installation and shape. the study also found problems with placement, design and colours of signage in case of blue-coloured signage, which are to be used for compulsory messages, and red ones, which are to be used as prohibitory signs. some prohibitory signs were found cased in blue or yellow boards as “beautification objects”., “soon after the study was released, the same presentation was made to senior pwd officials as per a request by the latter. the signage, which was categorised as wrong by the study, includes mainly those which had caution and other warning signs in blue rectangular boards. while some may need to be rectified, a majority comply with prescribed norms,” contended a senior government official., according to a senior municipal official, the l-g had a month ago ordered review of areas under their jurisdiction where road signage need to be put up. after the final order, a detailed report would be submitted to raj niwas by all three corporations., on the eve of independence day, mr. baijal had in a meeting convened to review the functioning of the municipal corporations and progress under the swachh bharat abhiyan directed the commissioners of each civic body to install sign boards specifying details of the officer responsible for maintenance of each street to enable creation of a public interface between them and local residents for redressal of issues related to their upkeep., at a similar meet held this past week, the same instructions were given to representatives of government departments., “the l-g emphasised that the pwd must take up the same exercise of displaying the identities and contact details of pwd officials responsible for maintenance of roads under its jurisdiction,” said an officer who was part of the review., one of the issues that has been identified so far by the corporations is overlapping of authority at intersections where minor roads meet main roads. according to guidelines, warning signs are supposed to be installed to aid commuters’ safety at such points to warn them of oncoming traffic in case of arterial roads such as ring road and outer ring road., united kingdom, there are three basic types of road signage: signs that give orders, signs that warn and signs that give information. each type has a different shape. a further guide to the function of a sign is its colour. all triangular signs are red. blue circles generally give a mandatory instruction, such as ‘turn left’, or indicate a route available only to particular classes of traffic, e.g. buses and cycles. only red rings or circles tell you what you must not do, e.g. ‘you must not exceed 30 mph’ or ‘no vehicles over the height shown may proceed’., blue rectangles are used for information signs except on motorways where blue is used for direction signs.green rectangles are used for direction signs on primary routes. white rectangles are used for direction signs on non-primary routes, or for plates used in combination with warning and regulatory signs. there are a few exceptions to the shape and colour rules, to give certain signs greater prominence. examples are the ‘stop’ and ‘give way’ signs. the words ‘must’ or ‘must not’, when used in the descriptions that follow, refer to legal requirements that have to be obeyed., source: uk government site, , the netherlands, the road signs of the netherlands are regulated in the reglement verkeersregels en verkeerstekens (rvv), 1990. road users are required to observe all road signs giving orders or containing prohibitions. traffic symbols have priority over traffic rules, inasmuch as such rules are incompatible with said symbols. , temporary traffic symbols on the road surface have priority over other traffic symbols applied in that location to the road surface, inasmuch as such traffic symbols are incompatible. where traffic symbols indicating a maximum speed indicate a speed higher than those set out in other manuals, the lowest maximum speed indicated applies. if both traffic symbols on signs and electronic signal panels indicate a maximum speed, the lowest maximum speed indicated applies. traffic lights take precedence over any road signs that govern priority. traffic signs may be represented on an electronic signal panel., source: road traffic signs and regulations in the netherlands, , israel, road signs in israel are decided by the ministry of transportation. they generally use the same pattern of colours, shapes, and symbols as used in europe and set out in the vienna convention on road signs and signals. signs are written in hebrew and arabic, the two official language, and english. the ‘stop’ signs, however, convey their meaning through the depiction of a raised hand. with the exception of the special shapes used for ‘stop’ and ‘yield’ signs (an octagon and a downward-pointing triangle, respectively), signs giving orders are circular and are of two kinds: prohibitory signs (e.g. ‘no left turn’) take the form of a

special shapes, such as the octagon for the ‘stop’ sign and the x-shape for railroad crossings. some signs can be localised, such as ‘no parking’, and some are only found in state and local jurisdictions as they are based on state or local laws, such as new york city’s ‘don’t block the box’ signs. these signs are in the r-series of signs in the manual on uniform traffic control devices

“tendency to cause trouble’!, the first step of my research was to interview women of different age groups, who have in the past or are presently experiencing psychological stress. i am specifically looking for women who had or are seeking medical help for depression, mood swings, and anger management issues or other mental health related issue. my research is to understand their backgrounds, seek their opinion on the topic of hysteria, and gain from their responses an insight in to the connection between their conditions and their gender, if any., this in my opinion helped me gather stories that might have been classified as hysteria in the past., hysterical hysteria is a devised piece that has been based on data collected by interviewing women through questionnaires and telephonic conversations. at gender bender festival a fifteen minute piece will be showcased, which later will be turned into a full length play., aarthi murali, when i came across gender bender's call for applications, i impulsively wanted to write about things we say and do within a home - things that we are in the middle of, everyday. it was a vague starting point. but it was also when i was turning to queer and feminist spaces to help me understand the drama within my home. i felt disconnected because these spaces were only having loud conversations about legal recognition, or the more personal struggle of figuring out one's gender. , i wanted to write something that looks closely at families. and more importantly, to find relief in trying to understand subtleties in structures that seemed loud and clear. , i'd start a new draft, tell myself it's the last one, and scrap it again. in the actual final draft, it only made sense to write about the process itself. this is a lyric essay that's as much about the process of writing about my mother, as it is about my relationship with her. it's an attempt to make sense of a relationship, through the writing of it. , arunima bose, earlier this year, i started drawing different vaginas depending on my mood. after creating about 30 pieces, i felt the series was moving in a new direction, one i was keen to see through. , in full bloom: playing with pleasure is an interactive installation, inviting the audience to touch, experience, and engage the tactile senses with the pleasure of a simple touch. , this work aims to gradually move away from the constant negativity poked and prodded at women and their bodies. , ibtisam, the majority of my childhood and teenage years were spent growing up in the gulf. my mother who learned how to speak arabic fluently taught my sibling and i the same. , i believe that this more than anything else, gave us a unique insight into the culture within the middle east. with this experience as my personal history it formed the foundation and reference of my inspiration for this piece that exlores the lives of the lgbtqia community in middle-eastern society, because it's where having a certain gender made a significant difference in any given situation. the idea continued to grow until it was a collective experience of not just my own but one connected to many women, and other minorities such as the lgbtqia within this region. , finally it is a visual attempt at comparing modern ideas and concepts of culture and the roles of women and presence of the lgbtqia against historical ones. , elisabeth pfahl, my work explores the processing of unexpected loss, in my case a double mastectomy which has reshaped my body at a relatively young age and without genetic ties or warning of any illness. , it is a long journey from breast reconstruction to 'one-on-one-off' to ‘flatness’, from the once familiar to internalising that “a kilo of tissue is just a kilo of tissue” to ""fit, flat feminine and fabulous”! in the throws of decision making,, i hope my ‘mala of 27 bras’ begins a conversation about the emotions that shape and guide one's understanding of self, beauty, loss and healing while the messiness of life dances around us. , sreecheta das, i had heard about china pal from one of my ex-colleagues. i wanted to make the film on her and hence went and met her. the idol making season had just ended (it was just after the saraswati puja) and she was about to go out on a vacation with her mother and workers. so it did not work out but she was constantly there at the back of my mind. hence, the moment i saw the call for proposals from gender bender 2017 i knew whom to make a film on., it's been more than two decades that chaina has started off as the sole woman artisan in kumartuli. it's astonishing how she's still the only female entrepreneur- cum-artisan in that colony. being the youngest sister amongst seven children, she never got her due from her family who do not celebrate her sucess or her journey. but her passion to stick on to the art has rewarded her with a family outside of her family: her workers. she is a ""didi"" (elder sister) to all of them., shilpa kothakota, in an attempt to portray ‘yellamma’ and ‘dasappa’, siddhanth and i embarked on yet another journey. playing these roles meant, to untangle the notions of gender and sexuality starting with our own. the characters and the process changed us irrevocably, making it an important milestone in our lives. performing land of ashes deepened my interest in understanding this form and this powerful deity of various marginal societies -

2017-09-09,all that data that aadhaar captures,"predictably enough, the recent supreme court order affirming that privacy is a fundamental right sent aadhaar’s public-relations machine into damage control mode. after denying the right to privacy for years, the government promptly changed gear and welcomed the judgment. ajay bhushan pandey, ceo of the unique identification authority of india (uidai), suddenly asserted, “the aadhaar act is based on the premise that privacy is a fundamental right.” he also clarified that the judgment would not affect aadhaar as the required safeguards were already in place., the fact of the matter is that aadhaar, in its current form, is a major threat to the fundamental right to privacy. the nature of this threat, however, is poorly understood., there is a common perception that the main privacy concern with aadhaar is the confidentiality of the central identities data repository (cidr). this is misleading for two reasons. one is that the cidr is not supposed to be inaccessible. on the contrary, the aadhaar act 2016 puts in place a framework for sharing most of the cidr information. the second reason is that the biggest danger, in any case, lies elsewhere., to understand this, it helps to distinguish between three different types of private information: biometric information, identity information and personal information. the first two are formally defined in the aadhaar act, and protected to some extent. aadhaar’s biggest threat to privacy, however, relates to the third type of information., in the aadhaar act, biometric information essentially refers to photograph, fingerprints and iris scan, though it may also extend to “other biological attributes of an individual” specified by the uidai. the term “core biometric information” basically means biometric information minus photograph, but it can be modified once again at the discretion of the uidai., identity information has a wider scope. it includes biometric information but also a person’s aadhaar number as well as the demographic characteristics that are collected at the time of aadhaar enrolment, such as name, address, date of birth, phone number, and so on., the term “personal information” (not used in the act) can be understood in a broader sense, which includes not only identity information but also other information about a person, for instance where she travels, whom she talks to on the phone, how much she earns, what she buys, her internet browsing history, and so on., coming back to privacy, one obvious concern is the confidentiality of whatever personal information an individual may not wish to be public or accessible to others. the aadhaar act puts in place some safeguards in this respect, but they are restricted to biometric and identity information., the strongest safeguards in the act relate to core biometric information. that part of the cidr, where identity information is stored, is supposed to be inaccessible except for the purpose of biometric authentication. there is a view that, in practice, the biometric database is likely to be hacked sooner or later. be that as it may, the uidai can at least be credited with trying to keep it safe, as it is bound to do under the act., that does not apply, however, to identity information as a whole. far from protecting your identity information, the aadhaar act puts in place a framework to share it with “requesting entities”. the core of this framework lies in section 8 of the act, which deals with authentication. section 8 underwent a radical change when the draft of the act was revised. in the initial scheme of things, authentication involved nothing more than a yes/no response to a query as to whether a person’s aadhaar number matches her fingerprints (or possibly, other biometric or demographic attributes). in the final version of the act, however, authentication also involves a possible sharing of identity information with the requesting entity. for instance, when you go through aadhaar-based biometric authentication to buy a sim card from a telecom company, the company typically gains access to your demographic characteristics from the cidr. even biometric information other than core biometric information (which means, as of now, photographs) can be shared with a requesting entity., quite likely, this little-noticed change in section 8 has something to do with a growing realisation of the business opportunities associated with aadhaar-enabled data harvesting. “data is the new oil”, the latest motto among the champions of aadhaar, was not part of the early discourse on unique identity — at least not the public discourse., section 8, of course, includes some safeguards against possible misuse of identity information. a requesting entity is supposed to use identity information only with your consent, and only for the purpose mentioned in the consent statement. but who reads the fine print of the terms and conditions before ticking or clicking a consent box?, there is another important loophole: the aadhaar act includes a blanket exemption from the safeguards applicable to biometric and identity information on “national security” grounds. considering the elastic nature of the term, this effectively makes identity information accessible to the government without major restrictions., having said this, the proliferation and possible misuse of identity information is only one of the privacy concerns associated with aadhaar, and possibly not the main concern. a bigger danger is that aadhaar is a tool of unprecedented power for mining and collating personal information. further, there are few safeguards in the aadhaar act against this potential invasion of privacy., an example may help. suppose that producing your aadhaar number (with or without biometric authentication) becomes mandatory for buying a railway ticket — not a far-fetched assumption. with computerised railway counters, this means that the government will have all the details of your railway journeys, from birth onwards. the government can do exactly what it likes with this personal information — the aadhaar act gives you no protection, since this is not “identity information”., further, this is just the tail of the beast. by the same reasoning, if aadhaar is made mandatory for sim cards, the government will have access to your lifetime call records, and it will also be able to link your call records with your travel records. the chain, of course, can be extended to other “aadhaar-enabled” databases accessible to the government — school records, income-tax records, pension records, and so on. aadhaar enables the government to collect and collate all this personal information with virtually no restrictions.",0.0828287023054465,data aadhaar captures,"predictably enough , recent supreme court order affirming privacy fundamental right sent aadhaar ’ public-relations machine damage control

2017-09-09,all that data that aadhaar captures,"predictably enough, the recent supreme court order affirming that privacy is a fundamental right sent aadhaar’s public-relations machine into damage control mode. after denying the right to privacy for years, the government promptly changed gear and welcomed the judgment. ajay bhushan pandey, ceo of the unique identification authority of india (uidai), suddenly asserted, “the aadhaar act is based on the premise that privacy is a fundamental right.” he also clarified that the judgment would not affect aadhaar as the required safeguards were already in place., the fact of the matter is that aadhaar, in its current form, is a major threat to the fundamental right to privacy. the nature of this threat, however, is poorly understood., there is a common perception that the main privacy concern with aadhaar is the confidentiality of the central identities data repository (cidr). this is misleading for two reasons. one is that the cidr is not supposed to be inaccessible. on the contrary, the aadhaar act 2016 puts in place a framework for sharing most of the cidr information. the second reason is that the biggest danger, in any case, lies elsewhere., to understand this, it helps to distinguish between three different types of private information: biometric information, identity information and personal information. the first two are formally defined in the aadhaar act, and protected to some extent. aadhaar’s biggest threat to privacy, however, relates to the third type of information., in the aadhaar act, biometric information essentially refers to photograph, fingerprints and iris scan, though it may also extend to “other biological attributes of an individual” specified by the uidai. the term “core biometric information” basically means biometric information minus photograph, but it can be modified once again at the discretion of the uidai., identity information has a wider scope. it includes biometric information but also a person’s aadhaar number as well as the demographic characteristics that are collected at the time of aadhaar enrolment, such as name, address, date of birth, phone number, and so on., the term “personal information” (not used in the act) can be understood in a broader sense, which includes not only identity information but also other information about a person, for instance where she travels, whom she talks to on the phone, how much she earns, what she buys, her internet browsing history, and so on., coming back to privacy, one obvious concern is the confidentiality of whatever personal information an individual may not wish to be public or accessible to others. the aadhaar act puts in place some safeguards in this respect, but they are restricted to biometric and identity information., the strongest safeguards in the act relate to core biometric information. that part of the cidr, where identity information is stored, is supposed to be inaccessible except for the purpose of biometric authentication. there is a view that, in practice, the biometric database is likely to be hacked sooner or later. be that as it may, the uidai can at least be credited with trying to keep it safe, as it is bound to do under the act., that does not apply, however, to identity information as a whole. far from protecting your identity information, the aadhaar act puts in place a framework to share it with “requesting entities”. the core of this framework lies in section 8 of the act, which deals with authentication. section 8 underwent a radical change when the draft of the act was revised. in the initial scheme of things, authentication involved nothing more than a yes/no response to a query as to whether a person’s aadhaar number matches her fingerprints (or possibly, other biometric or demographic attributes). in the final version of the act, however, authentication also involves a possible sharing of identity information with the requesting entity. for instance, when you go through aadhaar-based biometric authentication to buy a sim card from a telecom company, the company typically gains access to your demographic characteristics from the cidr. even biometric information other than core biometric information (which means, as of now, photographs) can be shared with a requesting entity., quite likely, this little-noticed change in section 8 has something to do with a growing realisation of the business opportunities associated with aadhaar-enabled data harvesting. “data is the new oil”, the latest motto among the champions of aadhaar, was not part of the early discourse on unique identity — at least not the public discourse., section 8, of course, includes some safeguards against possible misuse of identity information. a requesting entity is supposed to use identity information only with your consent, and only for the purpose mentioned in the consent statement. but who reads the fine print of the terms and conditions before ticking or clicking a consent box?, there is another important loophole: the aadhaar act includes a blanket exemption from the safeguards applicable to biometric and identity information on “national security” grounds. considering the elastic nature of the term, this effectively makes identity information accessible to the government without major restrictions., having said this, the proliferation and possible misuse of identity information is only one of the privacy concerns associated with aadhaar, and possibly not the main concern. a bigger danger is that aadhaar is a tool of unprecedented power for mining and collating personal information. further, there are few safeguards in the aadhaar act against this potential invasion of privacy., an example may help. suppose that producing your aadhaar number (with or without biometric authentication) becomes mandatory for buying a railway ticket — not a far-fetched assumption. with computerised railway counters, this means that the government will have all the details of your railway journeys, from birth onwards. the government can do exactly what it likes with this personal information — the aadhaar act gives you no protection, since this is not “identity information”., further, this is just the tail of the beast. by the same reasoning, if aadhaar is made mandatory for sim cards, the government will have access to your lifetime call records, and it will also be able to link your call records with your travel records. the chain, of course, can be extended to other “aadhaar-enabled” databases accessible to the government — school records, income-tax records, pension records, and so on. aadhaar enables the government to collect and collate all this personal information with virtually no restrictions.",0.0828287023054465,data aadhaar captures,"predictably enough , recent supreme court order affirming privacy fundamental right sent aadhaar ’ public-relations machine damage control

2017-10-07," sex, drugs and the dark web","it’s hardly a secret that marijuana’s quite easy to get nowadays. cigarette shop owners, paanwaalas, and otherwise innocuous dealers of innocuous goods hide their stash just out of sight of the unaware. rustom juneja is just another marijuana-smoking adult in one of india’s biggest cities. he used to get his ‘stuff’ from local dealers. till he “got bored of indian produce,” as he says. so, in 2015, he decided to go to the dark web., “i brought strains of marijuana from the u.s. and canada, from a marketplace on the dark web,” juneja says. the packages were shipped from their respective countries, they traversed borders, bypassed stringent security and checks, crossed continents, and landed at juneja’s doorstep., that is the dark web for you. completely unpoliced, willing users can find anything, from the aforementioned marijuana, to “hard” drugs, to military grade-weaponry and even sex workers. all delivered to your doorstep just like books or designer watches from amazon, flipkart, or snapdeal. and yes, some even offer cash-on-delivery. returns might not be as simple, though., earlier this year, a group of students were arrested in hyderabad on charges of purchasing lsd (also called ‘acid’) on the dark web. but they weren’t arrested because they had made the transaction on the dark web; they were arrested because the purchase and/ or use of lsd is illegal under indian law (narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances act, 1985)., in india, transactions on the dark web belong to a legal grey area. more importantly, the transactions here are mostly untraceable., so, just what is the dark web?, shadow world, the world wide web is a brobdingnagian mass of data, parts of which are ‘indexed’ so that they may be found by users through search engines (google, bing, etc). the parts of the web that aren’t indexed, and therefore available for public access, are known as the ‘deep web’. this was the part initially known as the dark web, with the ‘dark’ being more an allusion to being kept away from the light of regular access than its now more nefarious association. while it’s near impossible to put a number to it, unofficial estimates mostly concur that the vast majority of the web is unindexed., then, in the early 2000s, programmers began developing techniques that would be able to offer anonymous access to these hidden bits of the web. in 2002, the u.s. naval laboratory released one of the earliest versions of the onion router (tor), a software that would allow anonymous communication between american intelligence agents and operatives on foreign soil., this didn’t go quite according to plan, though. tor was soon appropriated by cyberpunks, who began using the protocol to give access to websites that would host, share, and trade illicit goods. today, the dark web is a sub-section of the deep web, accessed using specialised software like tor that ensures absolute anonymity., the onion protocol, “if you want to track anything on the internet, it can happen at three levels — the level of the person who sends a request, at the level of the person responding to this request, or it can happen in between these two ends,” says udbhav tiwari, policy officer at the centre for internet and society., “because of this structure, it is easy to track actions and resources across the internet, using the same terminology that makes it so easy to index and search. so, people began thinking this might become a problem.”, most of us have heard of the hyper text transfer protocol secure or https, a protocol that ensures that information is encrypted and secure the moment it leaves a computer till the time it reaches a destination computer. but this protocol only protects one of the three levels on which information might be tracked. the dark web is built to ensure that the remaining levels are also protected and kept anonymous., “the reason it’s called the ‘onion’ protocol is because there are bits of information that are encrypted over and over again. so, when something leaves one computer, it is encrypted with a layer, then it hits another computer and is encrypted with another layer, and it hits another computer, where it is encrypted yet again. when this information returns, each layer is peeled off, so that you get the information you requested, with none of the encryption,” tiwari says., this kind of encryption makes it borderline impossible to figure out who is communicating with who and what they are talking about, unless the physical machines at either end are compromised, or a vulnerability on these machines is exploited by setting up a fake website on the internet — a technique the fbi uses to track child pornography., and what does it all mean? a level of guaranteed secrecy with terrifying potential. a 2015 study found that light drugs were the most traded commodity on the dark web, and that as much as 26% of its content could be classified as ‘child exploitation’., a 2016 study found that almost 57% of live websites on the dark web hosted illicit material. the ease of access and the minimal chances of being caught has meant a steady rise in the use of the dark web and the murk it peddles., it’s a market where both buyer and vendor are rated, like uber. this establishes trust, and authenticates the veracity of a potential transaction. thus, for instance, buyers are obviously more inclined to buy an assault rifle from a highly-rated seller. and you will be sold grenades only if your ratings assure the vendor you’ll fulfil your end of the transaction., once a transaction is finalised, the payment is held ‘in escrow’ — a third party arbitration system which ensures the buyer is paid only after they have met their end of the bargain. the third parties also arbitrate in the event of a dispute., as easy as pie, juneja bought marijuana three times, all from the same vendor, but only two shipments reached him. the third time, the parcel never landed, but the arbiters decided in favour of the vendor because he had a much better rating and juneja lost his money., with no proper method to find out whether the vendor has shipped a product or the buyer has received it, this adjudication is seen as the best stop-gap arrangement. for juneja, as for many others, the loss was a deal breaker, and he didn’t go back to the dark web., when the first two shipments did arrive though, they came with absolute swagger and nonchalance. “the product was sealed and flattened out, as if it were a magazine or postcard.” it does say something of international security that it can’t differentiate between a shipment of the new yorker and marijuana., dark web transactions were initially carried out using legal state-issued currencies. however, the simplicity of tracking online transactions made with property monitored by the government led to the rise of cryptocurrencies — digital or virtual currency that uses cryptographic techniques for security and which would be beyond state control. besides the need to go underground, there was a political angle., “these people see money as a state incursion into private affairs,” says jyotirmoy bhattacharya, economics professor at delhi’s ambedkar university., the first, and still most popular, cryptocurrency was released in 2009 — bitcoin. created by an unknown person or group of people, going only by the pseudonym satashi nakamoto, bitcoin was intended as a ‘peer-to-peer electronic cash system’, which would be completely decentralised, with no central server or state authority. this meant that the value and proliferation of bitcoin would be determined by its creators and users., , the idea of a virtual currency has been around since before nakamoto, but a large problem was in limiting creation and supply. bitcoin was the first to solve this problem. “bitcoin uses a technique known as the ‘proof-of-work’ (pow). so, to create a new set of this currency, you have to spend some amount of computational resources. this limits how much currency you can generate, thus ensuring that the currency has a value,” says bhattacharya., what is bitcoin?, “a bitcoin is simply a solution to a puzzle. if there are a set of puzzles that are a part of the bitcoin protocol, one bitcoin is simply one of the solved puzzles of that set, along with a digital signature of who solved the puzzle,” says bhattacharya. a public ledger tracks the ownership of bitcoins, which ensures that the same one is not used again by the same person., “since there is no central authority, your transaction has to match the globally agreed ledger.” to ensure that ownership of bitcoin is legitimate, every transaction is published in the ledger, thus creating a ‘chain of transactions’ known as a blockchain., over the past few years, the value of bitcoin has skyrocketed, so much so that people have begun investing in it, as an asset. when bitcoin was first used as tender in early 2010, it was valued at around $0.003. for a brief while in august, one bitcoin was valued at $4,500, a record high., in the everyday world of eggs and bread, though, bitcoin has limited use. it is still unrecognised by several nations, and deemed illegal in many others. it’s in the dark web that it finds its most votaries. while it would be flippant to suggest that bitcoin is used on the dark web solely for illicit uses, it is difficult to deny its origins for that purpose, and its continuing use there., bedavyasa mohanty, an associate fellow at observer research foundation cyber initiative, says that there are indian users transacting on the dark web using bitcoin and claims that this number is only likely to increase as accessibility increases. “bitcoin cannot be tracked,” says mohanty. “with the ledger and the blockchain, you can trace the trail of a certain bitcoin, but it is anonymised. you can’t point out who owns that bitcoin.”, this, in effect, means an entirely anonymous transaction may be made on the dark web for any number of illegal goods or services using a currency that leaves a trail which goes nowhere and leaves no fingerprints. this, in a nutshell, is the danger when bitcoin combines with the dark web., several users i spoke to either claimed that fears about the dark web were mostly unfounded, or that the freedom it offered was an essential facet of the internet. but it can’t be denied that the sheer possibility that somebody can deal in child porn or hard drugs or deadly weapons right under the nose of the law is a terrifying one., from the perspective of indian law enforcement, given the technical knowhow they have to track down owners and users of bitcoins, the chances of discovery are minimal, says mohanty. the currency uses a system of public and private ‘keys’, ensuring that an intercepted bitcoin transmission is useless without those keys. to top it, india does not have any clear laws to regulate cryptocurrencies., “for india to regulate cryptocurrencies, it would need to legally recognise their existence,” says mohanty. “and if you do recognise them, what do you treat them as? as a security? or as a currency that can be traded openly, and so on. that’s part of the reason why the reserve bank hasn’t formally recognised cryptocurrencies.”, flagging illegal trades, bitcoin exchanges in india insist that they follow strict guidelines and e-kyc (know your customer) rules, ensuring that the identity of every customer on the exchange is verified. “if somebody tries to use a bitcoin from zebpay or any other recognised exchange, they will definitely be tracked down,” says saurabh agrawal, co-founder of zebpay, one of india’s largest bitcoin exchanges., “we use strong software; if any of our users use bitcoins for illegal purposes, we close their accounts. we’ve done this in the past and will do so in future as well.” he claims their software maintains a list of web addresses deemed ‘red alert’ sites, and the moment a bitcoin is sent to such a site, the transaction is flagged., others are less positive. “while we can track whether a transaction is made through illegal routes, to some extent it’s true that we cannot track all transactions in real time as this takes a large amount of data,” says sathvik vishwanath, ceo, unocoin., “but if someone is trying to buy or sell from illegal marketplaces, we have a mechanism where we can — and do — stop it.” given that customers are kyc-verified, “they don’t try to indulge in malicious activities,” he says., pan to rustom juneja. juneja made three transactions in 2015, using bitcoins purchased entirely legally from an exchange. “you have to create an account on any of the markets online, and transfer your bitcoins to that account,” juneja informs me. his account too was kyc-verified, and they had all his details — pan number, aadhar, and so on. he had no clue then that the exchanges had tracking methods. “look, if these actually worked, there’s no way we wouldn’t have been caught,” he says., part of the problem, of course, is that indian law does not recognise the dark web as a separate entity from the ‘surface’ web; there are no special laws for it. yet, even if laws were put in place, there are few ways in which states can monitor or block the use of the dark web owing to a host of technical and legal reasons., “a sense of urgency regarding the dark web, especially relating to the use of bitcoin for illicit activities, hasn’t been instilled in the government yet,” says mohanty. “what they are worried about is terrorism, and the use of anonymous technologies and chatrooms for radicalisation, terror planning, or buying and selling weapons.”, juneja is one of a few thousand active indian users on the dark web. nothing stops them from buying a strain of marijuana from canada. but nothing stops them from buying a kalashnikov either., sunny side up, the dark web isn’t necessarily only a marketplace for all of the world’s nefarious practices. the very anonymity and shrouds that the dark web offers can be used for general practices by users looking merely for privacy. , aritra ghosh, a ph.d student of computational astrophysics at yale university says, “(the dark web is) possibly the only way to do something in “secret” away from any kind of surveillance. onion routing still hasn’t been broken. so, it can play a substantial role in movements against companies, governments and so on.” ",0.016810490348226178,"sex , drugs dark web","’ hardly secret

2017-10-12,the architecture of choice ,"humans are not unerring. often enough, perfectly rational people tend to behave irrationally, as any salesman or advertiser would attest. simply reducing the price from ₹1,000 to ₹999.99 increases sales. economists used to believe that such human irrationality was compatible with economic theory. psychologists showed in the 1960s that humans are irrational in a systemic way., consider this true story. a class found an exam in which the average score was 72 points out of 100 ‘too tough’. the same set of students were delighted on scoring an average of 70% in a subsequent one. why? because the numerical average of the class scores was 96 points. the professor had purposely raised the perfect score to 137 points. this exam was tougher; the average score had dropped. rationally, the students should have been unhappy. instead, they were elated., that professor is behavioural economist richard thaler, the winner of the nobel prize in economics this year. he went on to show that even small departures from rationality have outsized impacts, and that limitedly rational humans don’t fit neatly into classical economics. so, he helped develop a new branch of economics, behavioural economics, to study the interplay of human quirks and economic forces., prof. thaler’s work is famously applied in constructing choices. how a choice is framed tends to influence choosers’ behaviour. choice architects can thus ‘nudge’ choosers in a direction. for instance, by making a pension plan the default option, while giving the choice to opt out, people can be ‘nudged’ towards saving for their retirement. scores of people have been successfully enrolled into pension schemes by default this way., pushing people in the directions that the choice architects prefer is not nudging, though. the nudge philosophy is that the chosen option makes choosers better off as judged by themselves. say the problem at hand is unhealthy eating habits, which lead to obesity. an extreme solution would be strictly-enforced bans and diktats on food that can be consumed and that which is prohibited. a less extreme public policy would be a sin tax on fat or sugar. nudge-type policies, on the other hand, would tend to include things like displaying the healthier food options relatively more prominently. or mandating calorie labels on sweets boxes., development policies become measurably more effective when combined with insights into human behaviour. a common refrain in india is that constructing toilets will not guarantee cleanliness and hygiene; swachh bharat will succeed truly if behaviours change. for which mindsets must change. in experiments conducted in some states, application of behavioural economics successfully changed the sanitation mindset. the world bank has documented some of the pilots. one such study found that open defecation dropped 11% from very high levels after a community-led total sanitation programme was combined in a few chosen villages with the standard approach of subsidies for toilet construction and information on the transmission of diseases., since going out in the open is partly a social norm, the researchers tried to facilitate the building of a new social norm. a technique was used in which volunteers escorted the villagers out to the field where they put some food next to some human waste. the experiment involved watching the flies go back and forth. the villages were nudged into collectively rejecting open defecation by making a declaration in public. the point being that to reap the benefits of sanitation, everybody has to do it together. behaviours changed measurably., another study involved puzzle-solving sessions. it helped understanding the effects of caste on classroom performance. boys from backward classes were found to be just as good at solving puzzles as boys from the upper castes when the caste identities were not revealed. in mixed-caste groups, revealing each of the boys’ caste created a significant “caste gap” in achievements. the boys from backward classes underperformed by 23%.",0.10811794131794134,architecture choice,"humans unerring. often enough , perfectly rational people tend behave irrationally , salesman advertiser would attest. simply reducing price ₹ 1,000 ₹ 999.99 increases sales. economists used believe human irrationality compatible economic theory. psychologists showed 1960s humans irrational systemic way. , consider true story. class found exam average score 72 points 100 ‘too tough ’ . set students delighted scoring average 70 % subsequent one. ?

2017-10-20,restrictions on women at sabarimala: it is complicated,"(a shorter version of this article appeared as part of a left-right-centre debate that can be read here), taking the sabarimala temple to court for restricting the entry of women of a certain age group is akin to meat-eaters suing vegetarian restaurants for discriminating against non-vegetarians by refusing to serve meat. common sense response would be to say—‘go find a non-veg restaurant, of which there are plenty’. tomorrow, self-styled, ill-informed reformers might demand that durga-kali worship be stopped because it legitimizes violence or declare the worship of shiv lingam as “obscene.” this is not farfetched because politically motivated groups have been decrying durga as a whore and krishna as womanizer. therefore, they declare these deities are not worthy of reverence., in any civilized society, gender equality is to be treated as one of the core values. however, with apologies to faiz ahmed faiz, aur bhi gham hein zamane mein gender equality ke siwa”. there are many more important values a democracy must uphold while standing up for gender equality—certainly not make a fetish of women’s rights., other core values of our democracy & india civilization are respect for diversity among the enormous range of communities co-habiting in india with substantial differences (as well as commonalities) in matters of faith, cultural practices, value systems, family structure, dress codes, food habits & ways of relating to the world as well as the divine. while the leftist-feminist reformers have no difficulty in respecting the rights of ‘religious minorities”—namely muslims and christians—to live by their own cherished cultural and faith traditions, when it comes to diverse hindu groups, they consider it their divine right to dictate terms., the unique grandeur of the hindu faith lies in the fact that each group, each sect and each individual is free to envisage the divine in whatever form, shape, and temperament that devotees like. that's how we have millions of devis and devatas with new ones taking avatar as and when the situation so demands or their devotees so desire. practically every village in india has its own gram devi or devata. our devis and devatas are not distant, unfathomable entities forever sitting in some distant god-land or heaven. they take avatar on earth to offer succour & comfort to those in need. in the process each one acquires distinct personality traits as well as preferences with regard to mode of worship., take the contrasting tastes of ma kali and vaishnodevi, both of whom are manifestations of the same shakti. while vaishnodevi demands strict vegetarianism, animals are routinely sacrificed as offerings to ma kali. lord ganesh likes modak as prasad while hanuman ji prefers boondi and lord shiva devotees offer milk and even bhang. devotees of various deities do not begrudge the practices of others. this freedom has kept alive vibrant diversity in our faith traditions because they allow individuals and groups to define their relationship to the divine according to their preferences., it is the same freedom which allowed manushi to invoke ten armed ma swachhnarayani, as our isht devi.she wields ten different non-traditional weapons that include a broom as symbol of cleansing society of corruption, weighing balance to symbolise social justice, a calculator that demands honest accounts of government, and a video camera that points to the need for an accurate grasp of ground realtity for those engaged in social reform. no hindu has ever questioned or protested against the powers we attribute to our isht devi or our mode of worship that includes jhadu puja., the hindu faith has thus remained amongst the most liberal in the world, with different groups and individuals exercising the right to relate to the divine in whatever way they wish, without insisting that others must follow their chosen path., even the most conservative among hindus don’t insist on uniformity of beliefs and practices. this spontaneous, mutual respect for differences in ways of being, ways of worship, singing, dancing, clothing, cooking and so on, is what enabled the rich diversity of india to survive through millennia. but in the name of equality rabid feminists can’t stomach such freedom and liberalism., traditional hindu temples are run by different sects with each choosing a particular deity in a particular form as their isht dev or devi. they’re not meant as tourist spots for all to come & go as they please. if you don’t respect the unique temperament of that deity or find beliefs of a particular sect offensive, you are free to opt for the devata or devi that suits your taste. there are lakhs of others to choose from., just as our colonial rulers with their faith in the superiority of their monotheistic faith, despised hindu religious practices, with their millions of gods and goddesses, our modern day missionaries can’t stand the temperamental nuances of our diverse deities. they have no problem in accepting that women are barred inside friaries meant to house catholic priests who have taken a vow of celibacy. but they can’t stomach the idea of a hindu deity who has vowed eternal celibacy which involves avoiding the company of young women. they take it upon themselves to cure this kink because their feminist indoctrination interprets it as misogny and gender discrimination! they choose to ignore that it is only one or two temples in all of india where women of certain age groups are denied entry whereas there are several ‘women-only’ temples where males are denied entry., as far as the issue of gender justice is concerned, the hindu faith can hardly be considered anti-women, considering it is the only faith that worships the feminine as shakti--the mighty force that moves the universe. male deities are powerless without feminine shakti from whom various devatas derive their strength., when i find the case against sabarimala frivolous, it is not to suggest that hindu faith traditions are writ in stone and unchanging. devotees reserve the right to change their dharmic practices as well as demand improved behavior by their chosen deities as per the requirements of changing times. that is how we have countless re-writings of ramayanas in different ages with each one interpreting ram in their own way and many even improving upon valmiki's depiction of ram’s conduct in various ways, especially his abandoning ma sita even after she had gone through an uncalled for agni pariksha or the deceit involved in the killing of baliraja. but it doesn’t behove non-believers or hostile attackers of hindu faith to impose their fads and sensibilities on groups who don’t share their worldview, especially if their practices don’t impact, leave alone harm the non-devotees. a genuine devotee has the right to demand change but not politically motivated hateful critics., ironically, the flag bearers of women’s equality don’t seem to have any problem with special compartments reserved for women in trains. most of them insist on our parliament enacting a law to reserve 33% constituencies for women whereby males are barred from contesting from those seats. they’re not satisfied with laws that promise equality. they insist on legislation that is unjustly loaded in favor of women. you can’t have it both ways – fetishize equality when it suits you and insist on special concessions and previliges as per your dictates.",0.1589676146638172,restrictions women sabarimala : complicated,"( shorter version article appeared part left-right-centre debate read ) , taking sabarimala temple court restricting entry

2017-11-20,what mumbai’s neighbours do with their waste,"the dry waste and wet waste being segregated by a society in cbd belapur. | photo credit: yogesh mhatre , in a continuation of our series on garbage segregation, we look at how some of the city’s neighbouring municipalities dispose of their trash, in the area of waste segregation, navi mumbai is streets ahead of other municipalities, if the navi mumbai municipal corporation (nmmc) data is anything to go by: around 4,100 societies out of 4,500 within its jurisdiction are separating wet and dry waste at source. encouraged by this, nmmc has decided to go a step further and ask the bigger societies to install composting units within their premises. “we have sent letters to all 400 societies, spread across 3,000 sq m and more, as also hotels, making it mandatory for them to start composting waste within their premises by november 15, 2017,” said dr. n. ramaswami, commissioner, nmmc., an nmmc official, who did not wish to be named, said that wet garbage is now not being lifted from the bigger societies that had been served notices. the residents, however, have asked for an extension of the deadline., the corporation collects around 700 metric tonne of waste each day from eight nodes: belapur, nerul, vashi, turbhe, koperkhairane, ghansoli, airoli and digha., on november 4, nmmc conducted a workshop at vishnudas bhave auditorium, vashi, on composting, in which nearly 700 society chairpersons and secretaries, besides hoteliers, participated. “there were several misunderstandings about segregation and composting. we explained how composting can be done easily at minimal cost and space,” said jayant joshi, microbiologist and bio-composting expert, who addressed the gathering along with vrushali magdum, navi mumbai coordinator for the ngo, stree mukti sanghatana., waste segregation has been on the corporation's agenda since may 2016. between june 21 and 25 last year, nmmc stopped lifting garbage from societies that failed to segregate waste at source. “this yielded results,” says tushar pawar, deputy municipal commissioner (solid waste management), nmmc. societies that don't segregate their garbage are fined rs. 250 per day., while most slums are still defying the segregation order, digha, which has a large slum pocket, is an exception; almost 80% of waste is being segregated at source. this is followed by vashi (70%) and koperkhairane (65%)., nmmc has now decided to encourage residents in bigger societies to install composting units. “more than 25 societies in navi mumbai and around 25 schools and colleges have already started composting garbage,” said rajendra sonawane, chief sanitation officer, nmmc., residents of shivsmruti cooperative housing sociery at pachpakhadi in thane keep separate garbage tubs for dry and wet waste. vibhav birwatkar | photo credit: vibhav birwatkar , the corporation has installed composting units at r. r. patil udyan, nerul and nisarg udyan at koperkhairane, so residents can see for themselves how it is done. in nerul, a volunteer from stree mukti sanghatana explains composting to residents from 10 am to 3 pm. in koperkhairane, an nmmc staffer gives a daily demonstration. two small nmmc vans also visit societies in each node and explain segregation and composting with the help of cds. by november-end, nmmc plans to install composting units in all gardens measuring 4,000 sq m and more, and in civic-run schools., residents are doing their bit to spread awareness. suresh bhagwat, a resident of sector 9 cbd belapur, says all members in his society are segregating garbage at home. swati sandeep tillu, an airoli resident and member of the ngo, mumbai grahak panchayat, has been composting at home for the past one-and-a-half years, “with the help of a small kitchen compost basket i bought for rs. 600.” ms. tillu has formed a group of up to 30 women in airoli who are composting at home too., this month, two out of the 13 proposed biomethanisation plants at kalyan and dombivali are set to begin operations., with the aadharwadi dumping ground bursting at its seams, the kalyan dombivali municipal corporation (kdmc) had proposed 13 plants in 2015, which were approved in march 2016. last month, the first plant was inaugurated at umbarde, kalyan while the other was inaugurated recently in barave, near kadakpada, kalyan., s. navangule, executive engineer, said vegetable waste – which is the highest in umbarde – is being treated at this plant. four other plants will be started by january next year. for the remaining seven, the kdmc is awaiting possession of land. once all the plants are operational, there will be no need for the aadharwadi ground, he said. the project will benefit kalyan-dombivali as well as 28 other villages in the kalyan taluka., for the moment, though, discontent is brewing in the city. the aadharwadi ground has a capacity of 200 mt, but handles nearly 650 mt of waste every day. kaustubh gokhale, an activist, filed a case in the bombay high court in 2009 to shut the ground, but the case saw no movement till 2016, when it was transferred to the national green tribunal. the high court issued a stay, authorising the dumping ground because there was no alternative. the stay was lifted last year and the plants were approved. the ngt trial has not begun yet., “the corporation has no authorisation to use the aadharwadi dumping ground any more, and they need to start working on the proposed biogas plants and other dumping grounds,” said mr.gokhale. “waste is piling up like a mountain and the corporation is doing nothing about it. we don’t feel safe anymore. the corporation needs to take immediate action,” said sunanda sheta, an aadharawadi resident., the biomethanisation plants have also run into opposition. the proposal to have one in kadakpada, a developing residential township, has led to a huge dip in registrations of new constructions this year. property rates have also fallen. local residents moved the bombay high court to reverse the decision, and they received a reprieve in the form of a stay order. however, the stay has now been lifted and the residents are disappointed, said srinivas ghanekar, rti activist. “the plants should not be constructed in an area that is home to more than 1,200 people, as the smell is noxious,” he says., a composting bin in navi mumbai. | photo credit: special arrangement , dilip jaisinghani, who moved to khadakpada two years ago, said, “we bought a house here in expectation of a better lifestyle but if the biomethanisation plant comes up, living here would be very difficult -- a constant reminder of our mistake to move in here.”, ambernath is a good example of how a citizen-led initiative can contribute to a clean city. a proud deviraj pawar, deputy commissioner, says, “ambernath is one of the cleanest places as compared with its neighbouring cities.” in the past three months, he says, “we have noticed a drastic change in the way waste is collected and treated.”, citizen-run organisations have taken the responsibility of cleaning the city, he says. with the help of members of the rotary club of ambernath and national service scheme, the ambernath municipal council (amc) has run awareness campaigns in the form of street plays, musicals, prabhat pheri (morning rallies), motion announcements (megaphones on autorickshaws),pamphlets, print advertisements and school shows., encouraged by the citizens' involvement, the amc has proposed a rs. 1-crore project for better management of industrial and non-industrial waste. the project involves the purchase of machines that segregate and treat waste, and approval is expected by january next year., known for the midc and ordnance factory, ambernath has a population of 2.5 lakh, as per census 2011. “as per the census, there are 81,000 houses but we are sure that over the years, the number has risen to 1.2 lakh. the success of this project will make ambernath the cleanest midc town,” says mr. pawar. in the same breath, he says, “we are being ambitious at the moment, but the support we receive from citizens is encouraging.”, council officials say the city's dumping ground, with a capacity of 50 metric tonnes, is underused. “for the total 23 sq. km in the city, we have one ground in ambernath west for non-industrial waste. that is also not being used to capacity: a sign that we are moving towards a cleaner society,” says mr. pawar., the bhiwandi-nizampur city municipal corporation (bnmc) works together with ngos to spread awareness on waste segregation, but refuses to adapt to any new technique of waste management or garbage treatment., bhiwandi, all of 26 sq. km, is divided into 23 wards, and as per the 2011 census, is home to nearly 7.5 lakh people. however, sunil bhalerao, deputy commissioner of the health and sanitation department, says the number has risen to 10.5 lakh in the past four years., altogether 97 garbage collecting vans dump the segregated waste in the nehru nagar dumping ground. the 10-acre land, which that is being used for the past 10 years, handles 450 mt of garbage every day. bnmc has 500 rag pickers registered with it who are trained in segregation and regularly vaccinated, says mr. bhalerao. the corporation has also started a campaign called, 'swacch banega india', which include street plays and local advertisements., “we have not proposed any garbage treatment because we haven't the felt the need for it,” he says. the bnmc has been allotted land near the bypass for dumping, but does not expect possession for at least another two years., two years after the closure of the mharal dumping ground, ulhasnagar municipal corporation (umc) still struggles to get an authorised dumping ground in the vicinity., umc officials say, the mharal dumping ground, 3 km from city limits, was used for more than 10 years and in february 2015, was closed. garbage is now dumped in a ground near durgapada in camp no. 5, ulhasnagar., sachin deolkar, deputy commissioner of the umc said, ""we have put in multiple requests for an official dumping ground but due to space constraints, it has been difficult."" there are at least 12 lakh people spread over 13 sq km of the city, he says., meanwhile, the umc is conducting awareness by way of motion announcements, advertisements on local entertainment channels and newspapers. last week, the corporation began to distribute dustbins among households, and volunteers are explaining segregation and treatment of dry and wet waste to residents., a proposal for more treatment plants should be ready by the year-end, he said, while lamenting the tepid response from citizens. ""we are trying our best but the response from the citizens leaves us, corporation officials, struggling with the problem.”, solid waste management in panvel, kamothe, kharghar and kalamboli comes under the city and industrial development corporation (cidco). cidco currently dumps 300–350 mt of garbage near the taloja midc., the panvel city municipal corporation, which was formed in 2016, will take over waste management from cidco next year. the pcmc has already begun playing a role in educating citizens about waste segregation, with municipal officials right up to the commissioner regularly meeting residents. the civic body also ran a clean panvel drive drive in september, in which 5,000 residents participated. taking a cue from the bmc, the pcmc hosted an exhibition on solid waste management at kamothe, displaying solutions for segregating dry and wet waste, recycling, various composting methods, and the generating of biogas., sudhakhar shinde, commissioner, pcmc, said a few large housing societies are segregating waste, but it will take time for everyone to join in, as behavioural changes take time., activists and residents agree on the need for segregation., khargar resident bhawana gupta said problems with garbage collection pushed her to start composting a few months ago. ms gupta also spreads the word with neighbours and friends, showing them her own compost bin to counter fears of foul odours. asmita sharma, a founder member of citizens’ collective shrunkhala, said kitchen waste composting is like a fad, in that people try their hands at it, but don’t continue. to keep people motivated, “during our sessions, we teach methodologies, urban farming, switching to healthy living by consuming organic food produced by themselves.”, the mira-bhayander municipal corporation is a good example of transformation in the face of adversity. once the target of criticism for poor waste disposal, nearly 60% of garbage generated in the corporation limits is now segregated., the change has been swift. at the heart of the criticism – from the maharashtra pollution control board and the national green tribunal (ngt) -- was the city’s solid waste management plant, which shut down in 2013. ever since, the city’s waste was being dumped in the open without being treated, and the ground became a site of frequent fires. the ngt threatened to halt all new construction projects in the twin city if the mbmc did not restart its waste processing plant., the mbmc appointed the indian institute of technology, bombay as a consultant to suggest way to dispose of waste scientifically. based on their recommendations, the mbmc chose a contractor to run the solid waste management plant., mira-bhayander’s 8.14 lakh residents generate nearly 500 mt of waste daily, which, according to the mira-bhayander municipal corporation (mbmc), will soon be disposed of scientifically. “the city’s solid waste management plant will start in 15 days. a composting facility is also under construction and will be ready by january 2018,” says dr. sambhaji panpatte, deputy civic chief, mbmc., from may 1 this year, the mbmc issued notices to societies to segregate their waste at source. and in july, it refused to pick up garbage if it wasn’t segregated. despite awareness drives along with regular notices to societies, only 5% of all the housing societies segregated their waste. but ever since the mbmc stopped picking up waste, they have witnessed a spike in societies complying with the notice. “the rule is still in force and those who don’t comply will have their water connections cut,” said dr panpatte. the mbmc is expecting that figure to touch 90% by the end of november.",0.010840044967951918,mumbai ’ neighbours waste,"dry waste wet waste segregated society cbd belapur. &#124;

2017-11-21,on finding solutions for water-intensive toilets in dry areas,"i had been in the hills a few weeks ago, wandering around with a notebook. one afternoon, i went to a little restaurant on a highway and drank coffee milky enough to sate a calf. honestly, i would have preferred a bench on a roadside dhaba. the only reason i had come to the restaurant was because it was attached to a hotel, and so, was more likely to have a bathroom., a lot of our decisions are governed by the question of functional bathroom access, especially for women. the ‘functional’ aspect is the tricky part. one of the biggest challenges to swachh bharat is the lack of water. people are being chased off roads and beaches, fined, and publicly shamed, and one man has been killed for protesting against such shaming. but no humane government can possibly expect people to use toilets without a reliable and affordable water supply., this is a big ask. we have desert landscapes in india and water supply is a perennial problem even in major metropolitan cities like delhi and mumbai. yet, the government has not seen it fit to look for ecologically sound solutions, even when the solution is right under its nose and waving frantically., in that restaurant in the hills, i noticed a local gentleman talking in japanese. the gent sensed that my curiosity was piqued and struck up a conversation. turned out, there was a japanese delegation in india, trying to build business ties with various state departments. the fabled bullet train is the result of similar business collaborations. however, it is a very expensive deal and one we don’t urgently need. what we need very badly, and the japanese can offer, are creative toilet solutions., the gentleman said that one of the things his group has been trying to do is persuade our governments to adopt dry toilet blocks, especially in water-scarce districts. i asked him how they worked, and he jumped up to offer me a demo. he had the basic toilet out of its cardboard carton and set up in less than 10 minutes. all it needed was a patch of land with a deep pit dug below. one would still need water to wash oneself, but for flushing, dry materials like sawdust or sand would do.",0.025019841269841275,finding solutions water-intensive toilets dry areas,"hills weeks ago , wandering around notebook. one afternoon , went little restaurant highway drank coffee milky enough sate calf. honestly , would preferred bench roadside dhaba. reason come restaurant attached hotel , , likely bathroom. , lot decisions governed question functional bathroom access , especially women. ‘functional ’ aspect tricky part. one biggest challenges swachh bharat lack water. people chased roads beaches , fined , publicly shamed , one man killed protesting shaming. humane government possibly expect people use toilets without reliable affordable water supply. , big ask. desert landscapes india water supply perennial problem even major metropolitan cities like delhi mumbai. yet , government seen fit look ecologically sound solutions , even solution right nose waving frantically. , restaurant hills , noticed local gentleman talking japanese. gent sensed curiosity piqued struck conversation. turned , japanese delegation india , trying build business ties various state departments. fabled bullet train result similar business collaborations. however , expensive deal one ’ urgently need. need badly , japanese offer , creative toilet solutions. , gentleman said one things group trying persuade governments adopt dry toilet blocks , especially water-scarce districts. asked worked , jumped offer demo. basic toilet cardboard carton set less 10 minutes. needed patch land deep pit dug below. one would still need water wash oneself , flushing , dry materials like sawdust sand would .","{'bjp': 0, 'cong': 0}",0,0
2017-11-22,"by june 2018, you will be able to see smart cities, says hardeep singh puri","hardeep singh puri. , two and a half months ago, in a surprise appointment, a former indian foreign service officer was made minister of state (independent charge) of housing and urban affairs. hardeep singh puri, who served as india’s permanent representative to the united nations from 2009 to 2013, has a multitude of projects to deliver on, including the prime minister’s ambitious smart cities mission, housing for all, and swachh bharat mission. excerpts from an interview on the challenges ahead:, in an ideal world, where resources are unlimited, you could perhaps devise a scheme to ‘smartify’ the entire area. clearly it’s not an ideal world. you have limited resources and you have to make a beginning somewhere. the present project, as i understand it, is the start of a process. it is not exclusive and it most certainly doesn’t mean neglecting other areas. there are other schemes like amrut (atal mission for rejuvenation and urban transformation) which look at providing basic infrastructure. i don’t think there were any claims by the smart cities mission to cover the entire city. i suggest you allow these schemes to unfold., in an ideal scenario, you should have the state and private sector in a happy blend. for much of the infrastructure like urban transport, especially metro projects which are capital-intensive, you need the state to step in. personally, i have no doubt that unless you do the pricing right, world-class facilities will not be available. safe transport, for example, cannot be subsidised by the state. it is just not sustainable. for example, i was travelling from gwalior to delhi and a four hour-long journey took eight hours for a variety of reasons. the price of the ticket was ₹900, obviously heavily subsidised. for comparison, in china which has a more efficient system, a ticket would cost ₹4,000., this is a purely rhetorical question. if the private sector is building toilets, the private sector will maintain them. recently, during an inspection of toilets, i found someone urinating in close proximity to a public urinal. i remarked to my secretary that i am sure this man is not doing so out of choice, but out of compulsion. the toilet must not be well maintained. as a result of that one inspection, we have drawn up a list of all public toilets in the ncr (national capital region). we have names of the authorities or agencies that build them, the name of the agencies responsible for their maintenance and the names of individual supervisors. the toilets were not getting maintained because no one was taking interest., let me tell you this: this government is not going anywhere; we are going to be around for a long time. i am sure what we need to do is devise systems and fix accountability. i have been told that by merely drawing up a list of public toilets, there has been vast improvement. it was the first step towards fixing accountability. we are also planning to come up with a toilet template that will have specifications for odour levels, water availability, exhaust fans, and so on., their (rural mission) task is much larger. for the period of 2014 to 2019, the gap in the number of toilets was found to be 68 lakh, out of which 40 lakh have been built and 14 lakh are under construction. budgetary allocations reflect the amount of work we need to do. tomorrow, if we have more people coming to urban areas, of course we will need to do more. for now, the budget is sufficient., we need to enhance our capacity. and capacity augmentation should not come from the government alone. others must be encouraged to enter too, in order to produce viable economic propositions. if your question is, ‘i see so much dirt around’, then my advice would be to click a picture and upload it on the swachh bharat app. i am told there is 75% compliance. we are dealing with an issue which previous governments have been brushing under the carpet. the opposition criticised prime minister narendra modi for speaking about swachh bharat from the ramparts of the red fort. i think he was right to do so. when a prime minister takes up an issue, it becomes a national andolan. today, on lines of satyagrahis we have swachhgrahis., rhetoric would mean there is more talk and no work. which isn’t true; there is work being done on the ground. and at least there is talk. at least we are shaming people., we have done more than we can. we have banned it, we are taking effective steps to discourage it, we are buying advanced machines. criticism like this is not constructive., the solution is not to swing into action just when you have that problem but to find a lasting solution. one is to de-congest cities. we made a plan in 2016. my ministry cannot take all the measures; there is a lot that the delhi government needs to do. i have spoken to chief minister arvind kejriwal and i have a couple of demands. first, metro phase-iv that has been pending for three years... he should bring in the proposal and we will clear it right away. then there are the delhi-meerut, delhi-ghaziabad corridors which need to be cleared. in so far as buses are concerned, we are seized of the matter. of 11,000 sanctioned buses, less than half are plying in the city. i can’t buy buses for them. they have collected cess worth ₹800 crore to purchase buses, which is lying with them. we are also working with dmrc (delhi metro rail corporation) to take urgent steps for last-mile connectivity., i am not going to comment on the delhi chief minister’s schemes. i have enough on my plate. i am very confident that the measures we have to take at the level of the ministry of urban affairs... we will be able to take them. in any case, pressure seems to have eased a bit with improvement in air quality. however, my way of looking at it is a little different. now that the air is slightly cleaner, we must take corrective action., for 70 years, we didn’t have a regulator. the history of indian real estate will be studied in two parts: pre- and post-real estate (regulation & development) act, 2016 (rera). real estate was the epicentre of black money. if you had black money and you did not feel like keeping it at home in gunny bags or under your mattress, you gave it to a builder, who would book a flat for you in his next project. rera, demonestisation and gst are instruments to clean this up. how many quarters will it take to clean up? i frankly don’t know. but two things will definitely happen — the speculative bubble that was going on due to black money shall be broken. and land prices will get more realistically aligned.",0.11200697450697453,"june 2018 , able see smart cities , says hardeep singh puri","hardeep singh puri. , two half months ago , surprise appointment , former indian foreign service officer made minister state ( independent charge ) housing urban affairs. hardeep singh puri , served india ’ permanent representative united nations 2009 2013 , multitude projects deliver , including prime minister ’ ambitious smart cities mission , housing , swachh bharat mission. excerpts interview challenges ahead : , ideal world , resources unlimited , could perhaps devise scheme ‘smartify ’ entire area. clearly ’ ideal world. limited resources make beginning somewhere. present project , understand , start process. exclusive certainly ’ mean neglecting areas. schemes like amrut ( atal mission rejuvenation urban transformation ) look providing basic infrastructure. ’ think claims smart cities mission cover entire city. suggest allow schemes unfold. , ideal scenario , state private sector happy blend. much infrastructure like urban transport , especially metro projects capital-intensive , need state step in. personally , doubt unless pricing right , world-class facilities available. safe transport , example , cannot subsidised state. sustainable. example , travelling gwalior delhi four hour-long journey took eight hours variety reasons. price ticket ₹ 900 , obviously heavily subsidised. comparison , china efficient system , ticket would cost ₹ 4,000. , purely rhetorical question. private sector building toilets , private sector maintain them. recently , inspection toilets , found someone urinating close proximity public urinal. remarked secretary sure man choice , compulsion. toilet must well maintained. result one inspection , drawn list public toilets ncr ( national capital region ) . names authorities agencies build , name agencies responsible maintenance names individual supervisors. toilets getting maintained one taking interest. , let tell : government going anywhere ;

2017-11-25, puppetry in odisha: who is pulling the strings?,"a ravana chhaya performance. | photo credit: indraneel lahiri , a white screen, about 4x6 feet, is tied to two metal poles at a height of three feet from the ground. a group of puppeteers and musicians sits behind it, hidden by a curtain that is hung from the screen. the performers hold up flat leather puppets against a light bulb and the shadow play begins., it looks like sunrise as the puppets gradually appear on the ‘horizon’, being raised from below the stage by the puppeteers on the other side. there is a clash of cymbals; the harmonium matches the beats of the mridangam; the daskathi, two wooden sticks held in the palm, does a constant clackety-clack. the singing is sometimes euphoric, sometimes pleading, sometimes heroic, as befits the characters., hanuman comes to the rescue of sita in lanka and is confronted by the demon-like lanka devi. in this black-and-white battle of good and evil, the latter must inevitably be defeated: there is raucous, victorious laughter as the demons fall in a trembling heap., i feel like i have been watching scenes from my unconscious. i remember gouranga charan dash, the retired head of the odia department in cuttack’s ravenshaw college and an authority on shadow puppetry, telling me that in the west, shadow puppetry is used to treat patients suffering from mental illnesses., i am at the museum of puppetry, called kandhei ghara (kandhei means puppet in odia), being set up by dash in serene, paddy-field-chequered kutarimunda village in odisha’s angul district. the museum has not been inaugurated yet: dash has arranged a private show to acquaint me with shadow puppetry, called ravana chhaya in odisha (ram, being divinity, theoretically cannot cast shadows; hence the name unwittingly making ravana the hero of these plays, which originally used stories only from the ramayana)., four for joy, odisha is perhaps the country’s only state where four forms of puppetry thrive — shadow puppetry; rod puppetry, where wooden puppets are hoisted up on stage with a metal rod attached to their body and covered by their flowing garments; glove puppetry or sakhi kandhei nata, where the puppets are formed by a ‘glove’, with the index finger becoming the head and the middle finger and thumb the arms of the puppet; and lastly, string puppetry, where the puppets are made to dance with the help of strings attached to their limbs., abhay singh and his glove puppets. | photo credit: indraneel lahiri , once it is ready, dash’s kandhei ghara will display puppets from across the country, host performances, seminars and workshops for national and international researchers, and also have a library. surrounded by puppets that stare at you in an uncannily human way, dash, who did his ph.d on puppetry and is also a ravana chhaya performer, tells me a play won’t come to life unless you are in a relationship with the puppets, who are the ones doing the manipulation, rather than the puppet-meister. the word ‘love’ keeps coming up., dash’s passion is apparent. he confides that in the early years of his engagement, he had been warned by his peers about the insidious charm of the dolls. “the puppets are demanding — they will make you forget every other love, make you indifferent to your wife,’ they had told me,” he says. if anything, that made dash’s commitment even stronger, and no, he didn’t forget his wife., sabitri dash, retired teacher of odia language and literature, is actively engaged with her husband in the promotion and performance of puppetry. together, they run the srirama institute of shadow theatre in kutarimunda, which aims to preserve, modernise and facilitate research on puppetry., india shares this ancient culture with other old civilisations like the greek and the chinese., puppet shows, especially ravana chhaya with its shadow play, are the earliest movies and it is ironic that the coming of television has irreversibly eroded the performers’ audience base., puppets for propaganda, puppeteers are dwindling in number but they still have the power to hold people in thrall, not just in the villages but also in the cities. this must be one of the reasons why the government has been using the art form to popularise its flagship programmes such as swachh bharat abhiyan, and to spread awareness on hiv-aids, human trafficking, malaria and deforestation., such modules are plugged as part of efforts to ‘revive’ puppetry, but the intervention, which has helped the artists in several ways, has not always had a salutary effect. governments often prefer to fix scripts according to political agendas and their conception of the ‘purity’ of the art form. this has tended to sanitise performances., rod puppeteer maguni charan kuanr. | photo credit: indraneel lahiri , as a poor man’s mode of expression and entertainment (the performers were often from marginalised communities), puppetry usually contained elements like short satirical skits against the moneyed class that would be inserted between narratives from the ramayana, mahabharata or the puranas. performed in open village spaces and reaching out to the audience, who would be sitting on the ground a few feet away from the performers, puppetry was always meant to be interactive rather than preachy., it also demands constant improvisation and funny, out-of-the-box bits to hold the audience’s attention., when the government stipulates script, musical instruments and performance parameters, there isn’t much room for innovation., most of the artists have chosen to toe the government’s line, not just for the money it brings (which isn’t really sufficient) but also because it gives them recognition. in my conversations with the puppeteers, delhi invariably featured as the place to be in., while the idea of performing in a closed space to an audience of aficionados in the capital is understandably attractive, it also means the art is moving further away from its origins. performances in villages, which had once given puppetry its settings and context, are now considered demeaning by the artists., dash has been trying hard to revive the village performances — his troupe still travels to the remotest regions — but most puppeteers are reluctant. dash says, “i know how their mind works. they believe that wandering from village to village would immediately brand them as impoverished artists and label their art as ‘low-brow’.”, when the performers fail to get government support or make good money independently, they sell or disband their troupes. dash lashes out at them, saying they are concerned with everything except their art., dash’s idealism and dissidence (he flares up about puppetry being employed for swachh bharat — “that is not art, it’s propaganda,” he fumes) — are admirable. at the same time, you cannot but sympathise with the puppeteers, who are unlikely to have either dash’s intellectual wherewithal or financial cushioning to keep the art alive., kumbhakarna in kendujhar, maguni charan kuanr, a rod puppeteer in his 80s, who has been performing from the age of 27, is an artist par excellence. puppets come alive in his hands in a way that has to be seen to be believed. he is also a sculptor, carpenter and designer: he styles his puppets out of wood and clothes them in multi-coloured costumes. even when they lie lifeless in kuanr’s battered trunk, they look striking; once animated by the master touch, they are irresistible., a string puppet show. | photo credit: indraneel lahiri , kuanr makes kumbhakarna, ravana’s brother from the ramayana, who is dressed in a black satin robe with a silver waistband and sports a stylish handle-bar moustache, ‘speak’ a few lines for me. upset at being roused out of season from his six-month-long hibernation, kumbhakarna complains in a loud, angry voice. kuanr is an expert at voice modulation: he can impersonate gruff kumbhakarna or plaintive sita with equal ease., when i meet kuanr at a half-finished kali puja pandal in kendujhar town, he is sitting on the ground with his legs outstretched — he broke his hips a few months ago. the next day is kali puja and he is busy mixing the colours to be applied on a 12-feet-high idol of kali he has made. the frail man says with confidence that the goddess will be complete by night’s end., when i ask about his puppets, he says, echoing dash, “they are the ones who direct me. if i don’t let them do that, they humiliate me. they are my love and they have put me in great trouble.” then, with sudden canniness, he adds, “they can no longer provide me with bread and butter. no work gets done without money these days. mon theke ki hobe, pashe dhan thaka chai (what’s the point of just having a heart, you must have money near you).”, kuanr has brought in a great number of changes to the art he learnt from his guru. he standardised the dimensions of the puppeteer’s box and used a hand-painted background for the first time. he started using larger puppets (about two feet high) to ensure visibility for a larger audience., monetary constraints have not been able to defeat the artist in kuanr. he is still eager for more innovations, thinking of making puppets of papier-mâché, which, being lighter, will be easier to carry. although his health has taken a beating in the past few months, he is looking forward to travelling with his puppets again — “i get calls from assam, manipur, darjeeling, sikkim. no artist can match my skill: when i play, everybody watches spellbound,” he announces with artistic hauteur., record dance, vidyadhar ratha, of karara mada village in dhenkanal, is a string puppeteer. he presents a portrait of an artist very different from kuanr. at the very beginning of our meeting, he tells me that government-sponsored programmes are convenient because they save him the trouble of having to book spaces, which would involve giving money to the panchayat, the police and local groups., his troupe, made up of family members and artists from neighbouring villages, sells tickets ranging from ₹15 to ₹50, depending on demand and the venue. business is usually good during the festive season., ratha emphasises that he is a poor artist, although, with his pink khadi shirt and dyed hair and affluent-looking household, he seems better off than most other villagers. he tells me, “make a strong case for the likes of us in your paper so that the government gives us an artist’s allowance.” his brothers, part of the troupe, nod in unison., string puppetry seems quite popular — as soon as the first note sounds from ratha’s harmonium, villagers start trooping into his house, even on the dark, rain-lashed day when i was there. i am a bit overwhelmed by the performance that follows., a ravana chhaya performance based on the swachh bharat abhiyan. | photo credit: indraneel lahiri , in a makeshift stage erected at the back of the house, garishly decorated puppets gyrate to odia and hindi songs played on a stereo. at one point in the performance, when a female puppet is dancing wildly to the bollywood hit, ‘nagin, nagin’, five rubber snakes are lowered on the stage to gambol beside her. i am told solemnly that this is called the “record dance”, performed during the intermission or whenever the artists need to take a break, usually to unravel the puppet strings that get tangled during the course of a show., hand in glove, i had heard interesting legends about the glove puppeteers even before i went to meet them in odisha. if eccentricity is one of the defining qualities of artists, then these puppeteers are artists through and through., most glove puppeteers belong to the nomadic kela community, which has settled down in odisha in the past few years. the kelas were once snake-charmers, magicians, quacks and trapeze artists, and have now morphed into pedlars., living up to their nomadic genes, they play hard to get: they have largely refused to be part of government programmes, saying that they won’t be instructed about their own art. but they also want to give it up, as they complain that it marks them as out as belonging to a marginalised, somewhat reviled, group., at kutarimunda, dash called them repeatedly, asking them to come over and give a performance. they agreed initially, but ultimately gave us the slip and i had to be content with a recorded performance., glove puppetry is called sakhi kandhei nata because here the chief characters are krishna and radha and their sakhis. radha is also krishna’s best friend, his alter ego, his soulmate. the philosophy is embodied in the performance, as the krishna and radha puppets are the two arms of the puppeteer. they are literally one body., i watch abhay singh performing in front of a village hut in cinematographer indraneel lahiri’s video documentation of odisha’s puppetry traditions. singh sits on the ground, a dhol strapped to his shoulders. one arm is krishna, with the characteristic blue face, and the other is radha, with a yellow face, both with colourful headgears of tinsel and ribbon.",0.10820298721340388,puppetry

2018-01-16,aadhaar: enabling a form of supersurveillance,"what really is aadhaar all about? is the machinery that supports it constitutionally sustainable? how does the creation of a central identity database affect the traditional relationship between the state and its citizens? what, in a democracy, ought to be the role of government? on wednesday, january 17, a five-judge bench of the supreme court is scheduled to commence hearings on a slew of petitions that will bring these questions and more to the forefront of a constitutional battle for the ages. the verdict that the court ultimately pronounces will decisively impact the future of governance in the country. at stake is the continuing legitimacy of the social contract that the constitution embodies., the aadhaar project (although the christening of it came later) was put in motion through an executive notification issued in january 2009, which established the unique identification authority of india (uidai). the uidai’s task was to conceive a scheme that purported to identify residents using biometric information — including, but not limited to iris scans and fingerprints — and to provide to people a “unique identity number”. this, the state told us, will enable it to ensure a proper distribution of benefits and subsidies, by plugging age-old leakages in delivering welfare services. what it didn’t tell us, though, was that it had barely, if at all, conducted anything resembling a neutral analysis of the costs and gains of the project before launching it., also readthe task before the sentinel: privacy challenges to aadhaar , the task before the sentinel: privacy challenges to aadhaar, in any event, the uidai steamed ahead with enrolments, even as the government dithered in enacting legislation. as a result, a mountain of data was collected without any safeguards in place. making things worse, a scheme that was supposedly voluntary was now proving to be anything but. citizens were coerced into parting with private information, compelled by threats from the government. a failure to enrol, we were told, would close doors to a raft of state services. slowly, as the list of these facilities began to expand, given that the project lacked any legislative sanction, the supreme court was driven to intervene. the court issued interim orders, on different occasions, clarifying that the programme had to be treated as voluntary, and that no person should be denied a service simply because he or she hadn’t enrolled themselves with the uidai., in march 2016, the union government finally introduced in the lok sabha, in the place of an earlier bill which had been stuck in the logjams of parliamentary committees, a new draft legislation titled the aadhaar (targeted delivery of financial & other subsidies, benefits and services) bill, 2016. remarkably, however, this proposed statute was categorised by the speaker of the house as a money bill, meaning that it did not require the rajya sabha’s affirmation for it to turn into binding law., ultimately, as expected, the bill came to be passed, and the aadhaar act came into force. this law not only retroactively legitimises the actions of the uidai before its enactment but also puts in place the structure that underpins the aadhaar programme. the law itself terms enrolment with the uidai as voluntary, but, as we’ve since seen, the government has expanded, and continues to expand, the use of the number for a wide array of purposes. now, before the supreme court, the aadhaar act and its various provisions stand challenged, together with the host of notifications issued by the government, which link aadhaar to different services., also readrights in the age of big data, rights in the age of big data, to reduce the merits of the petitions to a few issues would, no doubt, be reductive. but, ultimately, in question are four core interests: the first concerns whether the state can at all compel a person to part with his or her biometric information without securing the person’s informed consent; the second involves questions over the surveillance apparatus that the aadhaar act creates; the third raises questions over the level of exclusion caused by the use of aadhaar, for example, concerns over the extent to which the programme meets its purported objectives; and the fourth questions the degree of protection offered to the data that the uidai collects, stores and operates. on each of these, any sensible reading of the aadhaar act would show us that the machinery that it has put in place flagrantly infracts fundamental rights, granting, in the process, enormously invasive powers to the state., when a government creates a central database such as this, when it links that database with every conceivable human activity, it naturally allows itself access to the most intimate details of a person’s life. effectively, what the aadhaar programme tells us is this: our fingerprints don’t belong to us but to the state, that the government has an untrammelled authority to insist on expropriating our identity as a precondition for it to do its job. it ought to be clear that this vision, this basic hypothesis on which the aadhaar act operates, militates against the principles that lie at the foundation of any democracy. the essence of individual freedom, of the right to life that article 21 of the constitution guarantees, is that every person has a basic entitlement to bodily integrity, to decide for themselves how they want to lead their lives. but, how, we might wonder, can we truly be free, when the state is watching our every step?, also readall that data that aadhaar captures , all that data that aadhaar captures, now, it would certainly be naive to contend that an aadhaar-free india will also be free of surveillance. but that is not the argument that the petitioners are making. their argument is somewhat more nuanced. it is that the aadhaar act, in centrally maintaining all this data, enables a form of super surveillance, permits the creation of a perfect police state, allowing the government to track every one of our activities in real-time, to trace, at any given point of time, a person’s physical location. some might find this kind of surveillance exhilarating. but, in reality, it only emboldens the state to treat everyone one of us as criminals, to make a presumption of guilt at the grave cost of basic civil liberties., this mechanism for surveillance is further facilitated by the aadhaar act’s central design, which vests in the uidai a conflicting dual responsibility: to act both as the custodian of all the information that it collects and to act as a regulator of the aadhaar database. this means that any breach made to the data that is centrally amassed, unless exposed in the manner in which the tribune recently did, will only be known to the uidai. it will then be for the uidai to decide how it wants to remedy such intrusions. as a result, when our aadhaar data is leaked, we will be left with no recourse to an effective remedy., also readrights in the age of big data, rights in the age of big data",0.08003447170113838,aadhaar : enabling form supersurveillance,"really aadhaar ? machinery supports constitutionally sustainable ? creation central identity database affect traditional relationship state citizens ? , democracy , ought role government ? wednesday , january 17 , five-judge bench supreme court scheduled commence hearings slew petitions bring questions forefront constitutional battle ages. verdict court ultimately pronounces decisively impact future governance country. stake continuing legitimacy social contract constitution embodies. , aadhaar project ( although christening came later ) put motion executive notification issued january 2009 , established unique identification authority india ( uidai ) . uidai ’ task conceive scheme purported identify residents using biometric information — including , limited iris scans fingerprints — provide people “unique identity number ” . , state told us , enable ensure proper distribution benefits subsidies , plugging age-old leakages delivering welfare services. ’ tell us , though , barely , , conducted anything resembling neutral analysis costs gains project launching it. , also readthe task sentinel : privacy challenges aadhaar , task sentinel : privacy challenges aadhaar , event , uidai steamed ahead enrolments , even government dithered enacting legislation. result , mountain data collected without safeguards place. making things worse , scheme supposedly voluntary proving anything but. citizens coerced parting private information , compelled threats government. failure enrol , told , would close doors raft state services. slowly , list facilities began expand , given project lacked legislative sanction , supreme court driven intervene. court issued interim orders , different occasions , clarifying programme treated voluntary , person denied service simply ’ enrolled uidai. , march 2016 , union government finally introduced lok sabha , place earlier bill stuck logjams parliamentary committees , new draft legislation titled aadhaar ( targeted delivery financial &amp;

2018-01-17,following the grain trail: on india's public distribution system,"india’s public distribution system (pds) is in danger of being derailed in several states across the country. recent disruptions of the pds have taken different forms, from compulsory biometric authentication to so-called direct benefit transfer (dbt). the consequences are alarming, but tend to go unreported., , jharkhand is a prime example of this problem. by mid-2016, the pds in jharkhand had greatly improved, partly due to a series of reforms inspired by chhattisgarh’s experience and intensified under the national food security act (nfsa). instead of completing these reforms, for instance by removing private dealers, the jharkhand government made aadhaar-based biometric authentication compulsory for pds users. the consequences, documented in a recent study published in the economic and political weekly, were sobering. large numbers of people, especially among vulnerable groups such as widows and the elderly, found themselves excluded from the pds. those who were still able to buy their food rations faced considerable inconvenience due to connectivity and biometric failures. worse, there was a revival of corruption, as pds rice meant for those who failed the biometric test was siphoned off with abandon., also readdark clouds over the pds , dark clouds over the pds, the damage was made worse in mid-2017, when the jharkhand government mass-cancelled ration cards not linked with aadhaar. on september 22, the government claimed that aadhaar had enabled it to cancel 11 lakh “fake” ration cards, but this figure stands no scrutiny, and indeed, it was retracted later. many of the cancelled ration cards actually belonged to families that had been unable to link their card with aadhaar for no fault of their own. the family of santoshi kumari, an 11-year old dalit girl who died of hunger on september 28, was among them., the mass-cancellation of aadhaar-less ration cards, without verification and without even informing the victims, was both inhuman and illegal. the state government received some flak for it from the unique identification authority of india (uidai) — it is another matter that uidai is participating in the crusade to make aadhaar-based biometric authentication compulsory in various contexts. but far from learning from this mistake, or doing anything to repair it, the jharkhand government launched a further attack on people’s food entitlements: the monthly pds rations of 5 kg per person were restricted to those whose individual names had been linked with aadhaar in the ration-cards database. the following sort of situation is now very common in rural jharkhand: a family has five members, but only three are listed along with their aadhaar number in the database, so the family ends up getting 15 kg of rice per month instead of 25 kg. this restriction, incidentally, is a flagrant violation of the instructions issued by the food ministry in delhi on october 24, in response to the uproar that followed santoshi kumari’s death., all this, however, is just a trailer. preparations are on for a much bigger assault on the pds in jharkhand: the transition to so-called “direct benefit transfer”. under the dbt system, people have to collect their food subsidy in cash from the bank before using it to buy rice from the ration shop at ₹32 per kg. until now, they were able to buy rice from the ration shop at ₹1 per kg. direct benefit transfer is an odd term for the new system, whereby the food subsidy is provided in a very roundabout way., the dbt system was initiated in nagri block of ranchi district last october, on an experimental basis. the state government is planning to extend it in other parts if the experiment works. but it seems to have decided in advance that the experiment is a success, without paying serious attention to the ground realities., in nagri, it does not take long to discover that the new system is a disaster, and that most people are angry with it. the main problem with dbt is that people waste enormous time shuttling between the banks, pragya kendras (common service centres) and ration shops to get hold of their money and then use it to buy rice at the ration shop. for many of them, this is a three-step process. first, they go to the bank to find out whether the subsidy has been credited and update their passbook. second, they go to the pragya kendra to withdraw the cash, as the bank often insists on their doing so from these centres. third, they take the cash to the ration shop to buy rice at ₹32 per kg. at every step, there are long queues, and for many people the bank or pragya kendra is also far away. for people with mobility problems, like the elderly or disabled, this entire process is a nightmare. one elderly woman we met had to be taken to the bank each time by two relatives – one to drive the motorbike and one to hold her from the back seat., the ordeal was particularly trying in the last few weeks, when people had to adapt to the new system. many families have several bank accounts, but apparently, they were not told where to look for their subsidy. even the bank manager

bank to bank to find out where their subsidy had been deposited. this is all the more difficult as the food subsidy is not always easy to distinguish from other bank credits., if people had cash reserves, the system might work better: pds purchases would not be contingent on bank transactions. what is striking is that so many people in rural jharkhand, even in a relatively developed block

2018-02-01, power of a single identity,"the united states enacted the landmark social security act in 1935, giving birth to the social security number (ssn). the debate leading up to the act was highly contentious, as conservative republicans/congressmen declared, “never in the history of the world has any measure been brought in here so insidiously designed as to prevent business recovery, to enslave workers, and … opens the door and invites the entrance into a political field of a power so vast, so powerful, as to threaten the integrity of our institutions....” christian fundamentalists joined the crusade by proclaiming that ssn was the very mark of the beast prophesied in revelation 13:17: “…no man might buy or sell, save he that had the mark, or the name of the beast, or the number of his name.”, safety nets, the fearmongering ultimately failed to impress the american public, and over the years social security and its counterpart, medicare, have become the only safety nets for a majority of america’s elderly. while the ssn has arguably been overused for purposes that it was not intended for, and there have been many instances of leakage of information linked to it, nonetheless it continues to be the backbone of citizen interactions with the state — for the simple reason that no one has come up with a better alternative., also readaadhaar: enabling a form of supersurveillance , aadhaar: enabling a form of supersurveillance, eighty-three years later, the apocalyptic rhetoric of those opposing aadhaar in india’s supreme court harkens back to the arguments made against the ssn: “aadhaar tends to terrorise citizens with the country becoming a totalitarian regime; ” and “it is a ‘giant electronic mesh’ and will turn the country ‘into a surveillance state.’”, however, there is one important difference: the opposition to social security was informed by right-wing ideology, which saw it as the harbinger of socialism and an existential threat to america’s capitalist enterprise. in stark contrast, the movement against aadhaar is led by a small group of left-leaning activists, who are well known for advocating more and more government in people’s lives (the public distribution system, rural employment guarantee, food security, and so on), but who are now arguing in the same breath for the citizens’ right to be left alone., understandably, they do not sound credible when they invoke the bogey of big brother, who to most poorer indians is the benevolent state that brings succour in an otherwise precarious existence. also, having been the loudest voices against mismanagement of welfare schemes in the past, they appear a bit hypocritical when they now suggest that everything was working just fine until aadhaar came on the scene., the biometric difference, petitioners will, of course, argue that there is another crucial difference between the ssn and aadhaar: biometrics. unlike other personal information that one can change at will to protect one’s privacy, they say, one can’t change one’s fingerprints. granted, but as one of the learned supreme court justices observed recently, google and other social media, mobile operators, and our own voter lists have a lot more immediately damaging personal information that one has no real control over.

2018-02-02, promise and delivery: on union budget 2018,"if the union budget is construed as an annual tug-of-war between populism and fiscal prudence, arguably it is the latter that prevailed in the past four budgets tabled by the nda. however, populism seems to have gained an upper hand in arun jaitley’s latest effort. despite exceptional buoyancy in direct tax revenues (18.7% growth in fy18) and record disinvestment proceeds (₹1 lakh crore), shortfalls in gst mop-ups and dividend receipts have forced the finance minister to ease off on fiscal consolidation as mandated by the frbm act. the budget has reported a fiscal deficit of 3.5% (of gdp) for fy18 and pegged it at a high 3.3% for next year. the economic survey prepared the ground for a deviation, yet the actual numbers surprised the markets. armed with a war chest of ₹24.4 lakh crore in budgeted receipts for fy19, mr. jaitley has homed in unerringly on the root causes of distress — unremunerative farm incomes, unemployment, lack of social security nets and the squeeze on the middle-class taxpayer., follow the hindu's comprehensive coverage of budget 2018., with this in mind, mr. jaitley has announced a laundry list of ameliorative measures. while his intent is clearly welfarist, resource constraints have forced him to rely significantly on extra-budgetary resources and external agencies to give life to many proposals. if they fail to materialise, it can lead to a gap between promise and delivery. consider agriculture. after asserting that minimum support prices (msps) should cover all crops and assure farmers 1.5 times their production cost, food subsidy allocations for fy19 have been upped by a relatively modest ₹29,041 crore. a ‘fool-proof’ mechanism has been mooted to avoid market prices falling below msps, but it is left to the niti aayog to work out the modalities. setting up farmers’ markets is similarly a great idea to free small farmers from the tyranny of agricultural produce market committees (apmcs), but the project gets a mere ₹2,000-crore allocation., also readplaying on the front foot, playing on the front foot, the ambitious rural package in this budget brings in free gas connections to three crore new households, free electricity connections to four crore homes, two crore new toilets under the swachh bharat mission, higher micro-irrigation coverage, and so on. but of the massive outlay of ₹14.34 lakh crore required to bankroll these grandiose plans, as much as ₹11.98 lakh crore is expected to be met from extra-budgetary resources. a similar template has been used in social sector schemes. the national health protection scheme, to provide a ₹5 lakh health cover to 10 crore households, is a much-needed social security intervention to benefit poor households that rely overwhelmingly on private health care. but there is little clarity on modalities. the entire clutch of proposals on improving learning outcomes, providing universal health coverage and alleviating the lot of minorities and girl children is expected to be funded through a mere ₹16,000-crore increase in allocations to ₹1.38 lakh crore. infrastructure appears to be one of the few sectors where the funding problem has been addressed, with psus bankrolling a significant proportion of the ₹5.97-lakh crore outlay for fy19., also readgood but could have been better , good but could have been better, while being liberal in its announcements for rural india, the budget has been frugal in its giveaways to the middle class and the corporate sector. expectations of an increase in the basic exemption limit on income tax have been belied; instead, a standard deduction of ₹40,000 is back for salaried taxpayers. while it is only fair that the salaried pay income tax on their net income (after expenses) as the self-employed do, this deduction (which also replaces transport and medical reimbursements) is too small to establish real parity. the clamour for an across-the-board cut in the basic corporate tax rate from 30 to 25% has also been ignored, with the cut limited to mid-size companies (up to ₹250-crore turnover). though this will benefit the overwhelming majority of corporate tax filers, how this impacts the competitive edge of india’s largest companies in the global context will be debated. especially so, since the u.s. recently slashed its corporate tax rate to 21% and european nations average 20%. for the salariat and the corporate sector, the increase in education cess will offset some of the gains from these tax cuts. senior citizens have benefited, particularly from the tax relief on interest from bank deposits and post office schemes, which has been hiked from ₹10,000 to ₹50,000 a year. these interest payouts are also exempt from the vexatious tds provisions. this relief renders senior citizens far less vulnerable to steadily dwindling interest rates on bank deposits and small savings schemes; it also helps them to continue relying on fixed-income instruments to cover living expenses. this relief may reverse the unhealthy trend of risk-averse savers shifting wholesale from bank deposits to market-linked options such as equity mutual funds, in search of higher returns., also reada shot in the arm for farm growth ",0.040780605053860865,promise delivery : union budget 2018,"union budget construed annual tug-of-war populism fiscal prudence , arguably latter prevailed past four budgets tabled nda. however , populism seems gained upper hand arun jaitley ’ latest effort. despite exceptional buoyancy direct tax revenues ( 18.7 % growth fy18 ) record disinvestment proceeds ( ₹ 1 lakh crore ) , shortfalls gst mop-ups dividend receipts forced finance minister ease fiscal consolidation mandated frbm act. budget reported fiscal deficit 3.5 % ( gdp ) fy18 pegged high 3.3 % next year. economic survey prepared ground deviation , yet actual numbers surprised markets. armed war chest ₹ 24.4 lakh crore budgeted receipts fy19 , mr. jaitley homed unerringly root causes distress — unremunerative farm incomes , unemployment , lack social security nets squeeze middle-class taxpayer. , follow hindu ' comprehensive coverage budget 2018. , mind , mr. jaitley announced laundry list ameliorative measures. intent clearly welfarist , resource constraints forced rely significantly extra-budgetary resources external agencies give life many proposals. fail materialise , lead gap promise delivery. consider agriculture. asserting minimum support prices ( msps ) cover crops assure farmers 1.5 times production cost , food subsidy allocations fy19 upped relatively modest ₹ 29,041 crore. ‘fool-proof ’ mechanism mooted avoid market prices falling msps , left niti aayog work modalities. setting farmers ’ markets similarly great idea free small farmers tyranny agricultural produce market committees ( apmcs ) , project gets mere ₹ 2,000-crore allocation. , also readplaying front foot , playing front foot , ambitious rural package budget brings free gas connections three crore new households , free electricity connections four crore homes , two crore new toilets swachh bharat mission , higher micro-irrigation coverage , on. massive outlay ₹ 14.34 lakh crore required bankroll grandiose plans , much ₹ 11.98 lakh crore expected met extra-budgetary resources. similar template used social sector schemes. national health protection scheme , provide ₹ 5 lakh health cover 10 crore households , much-needed social security intervention benefit poor households rely overwhelmingly private health care. little clarity modalities. entire clutch proposals improving learning outcomes , providing universal health coverage alleviating lot minorities girl children expected funded mere ₹ 16,000-crore increase allocations ₹ 1.38 lakh crore. infrastructure appears one sectors funding problem addressed , psus bankrolling significant proportion ₹ 5.97-lakh crore outlay fy19. , also readgood could better , good could better , liberal announcements rural india , budget frugal giveaways middle class corporate sector. expectations increase basic exemption limit income tax belied ;

2018-02-04," for mumbai’s poor women, there is no place to go ","mumbai: in the early hours of december 26 last year, sitabai solanke, 51, couldn’t find a toilet at kalyan station, and so relieved herself in the bushes near the tracks. on her way back to the platform, a train ran over her and she died., claira dias, 20, has an equally tragic story to share. till a few years ago, children from azad nagar, the slum in mahim where she lives, would defecate on the railway tracks near their homes because there was no toilet. one day, she says, a man who lived nearby lured a four-year-old with sweets and raped her there and went on to mutilate her private parts. ms. dias says the girl was not even given counselling, and nothing has been heard of the accused since. “jaisa ek bura sapna tha, hum uthke bhul gaye it was like a bad dream: we woke and forgot it. our children defecate into the nullah that runs in front of our homes, because we do not let them out alone anymore.”, the lack of toilet facilities for women plays out in many ways, all not as horrific, but definitely stressful., for a decade, saraswati narayankar has been setting up her stall of vegetables on st. anthony’s road, vakola, at a 15-minute walk away from home. she wakes up at 4 a.m., queues up for an average of 15 minutes at the pay toilet near her home, and then heads to dadar to buy her stock. then, from 8 a.m. to 2 p.m., and from 5 p.m. to 9 p.m., she is at her stall. there is a public toilet a minute’s walk away, but she uses it only if she absolutely must. “there is nobody to maintain it, and so it is always dirty,” she says. “there is no way i can risk falling ill by going there.” on the days of her menstruation, she suffers the most. with no water supply in the public toilet, she controls her bladder for six hours and limits her consumption of water. “i go home, change my sanitary napkin, rest and then return to work. there is no way i can use the toilet without water on those days.”, not far from ms. narayankar's vegetable stall in vakola, kalpana jagde worries about leaving her provision store unattended, if she has to relieve herself. “earlier, there were 10 shops here: a tailor, a scrap collector, vegetable vendor, electrical repair store, and many others. all of these shops were run by women, and we had a pact among ourselves to keep one eye on each other’s wares when one of us has to attend to nature’s call.” the other vendors did not have licences and were evicted, and while she has one, hers is the only shop standing. “but it means that i cannot afford to forget going to the bathroom before i leave home.”, street hawkers, construction workers, house help who aren’t allowed to use the toilets in the homes they work in, even police personnel on outdoor duty, there are lakhs of such women across the city, effectively invisible, silent sufferers when it comes to one of the most basic human needs: sanitation. the simple act of relieving themselves is a battle, because public toilets frequently come without proper doors, with no electricity and water supply, with unclean pots and broken seats, poor or no disposal facilities for sanitary napkins. and always, there is the looming fear of harassment and abuse. they must plan their movements based on access to hygienic and safe toilets, reducing their food and water intake so they can avoid going to the toilet through the day., the issue with public toilets is not limited to the women living in open spaces and slums alone. according to nandita gandhi, co-director, akshara centre, the problem cuts across classes, and is as important for working women. “it is a real issue for women who are travelling long distances to work. where are they supposed to go? many of them end up suffering from urinary tract infections.” this leads to women having to calculate their daily path to work, based on the assumption of no toilets if they are on the road, or the distance to the one they could be most comfortable using., absent in policy, mumbai has 8,482 public and community toilet blocks, with 39,402 seats for women and 42,511 for men, according to the brihanmumbai municipal corporation (bmc) portal (see little relief in sight). however, the report ‘toilet torture’, commissioned by the observer research foundation and based on a bmc study undertaken in 2014, stated that nearly 58% of the community toilets in the slums had no electricity, and 78% had no water. the problem was graver for pregnant women and mothers of young children. “pregnant women are scared to go into the jungle due to the fear of falling,” the study says. “so, a preferable way for them is to relieve themselves in the saree and then wash it. the children also end up relieving themselves on the road as they can’t go into the jungle alone.”, in the years since that study, the swacch bharat mission has been making headlines. but just how much has changed on the ground?, “sanitation is a governance issue,” said payal tiwari, author of the study. “during our fieldwork, we found that even as people had the resources and the will to find space to build a toilet, they were not provided with a sewer connection by their corporator.”, on february 1, union finance minister arun jaitley announced that the overall allocation for swachh bharat mission for both urban and rural areas was proposed to be raised to ₹17,843 crore in 2018-19 (from ₹16,248 crore in 2017-18). however, the allocation for the mission for 2017-18 had been raised to ₹19,248 crore as per revised estimates, which means this is actually a near-₹2,000 crore dip in the allocation. ms. tiwari says, “the entire scheme has been more about propaganda. there is no clear blueprint in place to address issues related to solid waste management, cleanliness, maintenance and access. public sanitation has got to be more than just about building new infrastructure.”, dr. amita bhide, head, school of habitat studies, tata institute of social sciences (tiss) says that while the government has been finding answers to issues related to floor space index and transferable development rights to cope with demand for housing, “sanitation remains one of the most neglected dimensions in planning. the toilet is the most practical, short-term, everyday need for both men and women. however, the standard that we have set for ourselves in constructing a toilet as a public amenity is so low that we do not look at women’s sanitation as more than just peeing.”, inadequate, expensive, there have been efforts to construct and maintain community toilets in the various slum pockets across the city, some free and others pay-to-use. but the mere existence of a toilet does not mean access to sanitation for women., especially for those from the lowest end of the economic spectrum, like migrant women living in open spaces and slums, the cost of a pay-toilet — ₹2 to ₹10 — is a deterrent, so they will eat and drink less during the day and defecate in the open before the sun comes up. shweta tambe, project director, committee for right to housing said, ""families end up spending a substantial amount of money on just using the toilet. imagine a family of four members, with each member having to use the toilet at least twice a day... it is a huge sum to pay especially if they are on a daily wage. in fact, women might end up eating less or drinking less water just to reduce the number of toilet visits. in nargis dutt nagar in bandra, the public toilet is on the main road. it is very discomforting for women to queue up outside."", public toilets in the city are managed by the bmc, mhada and mmrda, depending on the ownership of land where the toilet stands. as part of bmc’s slum sanitation programme, 10% of funds to construct toilets come from the slum communities and the rest is funded by , the corporation. currently, there are 750 toilet blocks in the city as part of this programme with access passes issued to local users. , non-government organisations have constructed pay-toilets with permission from bmc, and they are expected to maintain them for a set number of years. people are expected to pay to use them for a variety of sanitary purposes, including bathing and washing clothes. finally, local area development funds of mps and mlas are used to construct toilets on land owned by mhada, but there is no onus on anyone to maintain them., mumtaz sheikh, who spearheads the right to pee campaign, says that most toilets were constructed a long time ago, and have not been structurally audited, which is why there are innumerable cases of toilet floors collapsing. and as a result of sub-contracting the work, “even if someone has a complaint about , the toilet, they are not addressed, as nobody knows who is ultimately responsible for them.”, ms. sheikh believes that the lack of a vision also comes from a perception that toilets are dirty spaces, best constructed at a distance. “usually toilets are built next to an overflowing garbage dump,” she notes, and seen through the same lens. “so, there is nobody to clean them. railway platforms have food stalls right in the centre, but the toilets are only on one of the platforms and only towards the end, with hardly any light, which also makes them corners for drug addicts.”, the safety issue, ms. sheikh says that there has been a marked improvement, with more toilets visible along highways. but aside from access to water and lighting, there , is also concern about safety. “men do not have to worry about safety as much as women.”, ms. dias from azad nagar says they always live in fear of drug addicts who stare at them as they attend nature’s call; the boys carry blades or cutters for use if the women dare question them. “once a lady got her hip cut. we don’t risk it now and only make use of stones around the railway tracks for defence. screaming for help is not a solution.”, in december 2017, akshara centre in collaboration with un women, safetypin and uber, released their safety audit in mumbai, which brought to the fore the harassment experienced by women in the city due to poor facilities. “in so many cases, the doors of toilets are broken, there are no lights,” says ms. gandhi of akshara. “the roads leading to the toilets are also dimly lit. in fact, even if they put one light in the toilet, we can solve half the problem related to access for women.”, in 2017, tiss audited access to sanitation in m-east ward. in the 400 households of bhim nagar, the institute's researchers found that women preferred to go to an open space to relieve themselves before sunrise and after sunset. however, they still encountered men who harassed them or even photographed the act. purva dewoolkar who is part of the ‘transforming m ward’ project initiated by tiss, says the women chipped in their own money to create an enclosed structure with tin sheets. , no place for loos, according to the national policy on sanitation, there has to be a toilet every 500 metres, and the density of toilets has to be one seat for every 35 men, and one seat for every 25 women., seema redkar, former special officer with the bmc and now a consultant on sanitation for the tata trusts, says the deficit must be addressed not just by getting the funds but also factoring in the city's space constraints. “if ‘toilets for all’ has to be implemented,” she says, “then bmc would have to ensure that sewage lines are installed in every community, and this is not something that can be done overnight. it would require foresight and a well-networked plan. besides, 55% of mumbai's land is privately owned, so nobody wants a toilet in their vicinity.” in several older housing compounds in mumbai, there is a space for large dustbins and toilets that drivers and domestic workers use. she suggests this concept could be reintroduced, perhaps making these pay-toilets, or for a set of users., ideally, ms. redkar says every public space — parks, gardens, railway stations — should have a toilet. “we must also make it compulsory for restaurants to construct toilets, and allow people to use them,” she says. “only well-dressed women are allowed to enter a restaurant or hotel to use the bathroom.” all national highways should have toilets, as per the national policy on sanitation. citing the example of toilets at petrol pumps that are perceived to be safer, ms. redkar says, “toilets at public spaces , should not be constructed in isolation, but be in the vicinity of other establishments to ensure more footfall and better maintenance.”, in march 2017, the south delhi municipal corporation issued a notification that made it mandatory for all restaurants and hotels under its jurisdiction to allow any member of the public to use their toilets by paying up to ₹5., civic plans, kiran dighavkar, assistant municipal commissioner, a ward, and nodal officer at bmc for the swachh bharat abhiyan, says that mumbai has 8,100 pay-and-use toilet blocks, with 10,000 such community toilet blocks in the slums. “the ideal ratio of people to toilets is still not there, but we are working on it. the current ratio of persons per seat is anywhere between 75 and 150. by march, we will be adding 2,000 seats in the city. we are now identifying locations to build more toilets.”, mr. dighavkar says that the corporation’s focus will now be on constructing free toilets and it has allocated ₹50 crore for this. “earlier, we used to give land, somebody would invest money, construct the toilet, and with ₹2 per use, it was revenue for them. but the better way, to cut overcharging and ensure maintenance, is to do away with these toilets, construct our own toilets, and maintain them through outside agencies. the housekeeping agency will be given a fee for maintenance, so that the public can use the toilets for free.”, the bmc budget has moved in this direction by providing for ₹500 crore for the construction of 20,000 toilets over the next three years. many new toilets will be replacing existing structures. , a beginning has also been made on feminine hygiene, mr. dighavkar says. bmc schools now have sanitary napkin vending machines, and, “we are now promoting that all public toilets also have these machines. inox has said they will install these, as well as in the women’s toilet inaugurated on saturday. initially we are looking at tapping , corporate social responsibility (csr) funds for this.” and with women-only toilets, “the issue of them not being safe does not arise.”, better, but enough?, ms. redkar says she has noticed a positive shift in the scope of public toilets. “there is a sense of ownership of toilet blocks. due to the bmc’s slum adoption programme, most of the contractors are women, and people have been demanding better amenities. there is a large demand for individual toilets, and at the same time, people are also ready to contribute to get better amenities.”, ms. shaikh is not entirely convinced that punishment for open defecation and using csr funds are answers; there needs to be a long-term plan. “we need to take the voices of the communities, and have them decide what works best for them,” she says. “otherwise, these ideas of new toilets created with csr funds perceive communities as people without any stake. this is also the case with the swacch bharat campaign: it is a good idea, but where is the blueprint? we are being taxed for it, but where is the audit of those funds? what are the long-term goals?”, till that outlook changes, till those blueprints are put down, women like ms. dias, ms. narayankar and ms. jagde will have to grit their teeth and bear with it., inputs by siddhee washimkar, a long way to go, • in

2018-02-09, 50% of swachh bharat funds remains unused,"half of the funds ever released for sanitation projects under the centre’s swachh bharat mission remained unused by delhi’s civic bodies and government agencies as of the end of 2017, a delhi government report showed. , at a time the delhi government is in the process of finalising its budget for 2018-2019, a report about the amount released and utilised for swachh bharat mission compiled by the urban development department shows that a total of ₹149.86 crore was released as on december 31, 2017. of that, the civic bodies and the government agencies were able to spend ₹74.87 crore, with ₹74.99 crore remaining unused as on december 31, 2017., of the amount used, the majority went to projects of solid waste management (₹52.68 crore), followed by construction of community toilets (₹9.99 crore) and aiding construction of individual household toilets (₹7.80 crore). in addition, ₹4.24 crore was used for information, education and communication costs and ₹14.89 lakh on capacity building. , share of funding, an official of the urban development department said that the funds were disbursed by the centre in financial years 2014-2015 and 2015-2016 and the delhi government added its share and released the total amount to the civic bodies and agencies. , since the funds have not been utilised fully, additional funds for swachh bharat mission projects were not released in subsequent years, said the official. according to the swachh bharat mission guidelines, the civic bodies are expected to put in their share of funding before they are given the money from the centre and the state. , while the new delhi municipal council and the south delhi municipal corporation have been able to use 100% and 97% of the funds released to them, the other municipalities and departments lag behind., the north delhi municipal corporation has spent 22%, the east delhi municipal corporation 53% and the delhi cantonment board 47% of the funds released. the delhi government’s delhi urban shelter improvement board (dusib) has spent 39% of the funds released. , sources said the dusib’s utilisation was higher, but it was yet to complete the accounting process. , according to urban development department sources, at a meeting recently, chief secretary anshu prakash asked the north corporation and the edmc to use up to 75% of funds by the end of this financial year or return some of the funds. , cash crunch, explaining the reason behind the unused funds, a senior official of the north corporation said the civic body was not being able to make its contribution towards projects because of cash crunch. “in many cases the ratio of the centre and the civic body’s contribution is either 70:30 or 80:20. the sad part is that the north corporation is facing a major shortage of funds and does not even have the resources to make 20% of the contribution,” the official said. the official said that despite initiating several revenue generation projects, the income has been low., in the edmc, which is also reeling under a financial crisis, a major portion of the allocated funds have been utilised in public awareness programmes and building of public toilets., “we have decided to go to the basics. toilets are being built at every neighbourhood and market. the resident welfare associations are also being roped in

2018-02-25, the crisis in indian banking ,"as news reports of scams pour in one after the other, it is becoming clear that credit administration in india’s public sector banks is a near-sham. recently, when quarterly results were being published, there was a virtual competition among the psbs in declaring losses, or at least a decline in profits. all banks were unanimous in explaining their losses as additional provisioning for bad loans. it will not be over-stretching things to conclude that bank advances consist of only two components, namely, identified npas (non performing assets) and those yet to be identified., this situation leads us to ask one basic question, whether our psbs are really equipped to handle advances. except for some computer program-driven retail loans with factory-type outputs, a majority of the banks today do not venture into msme or corporate loans. and those that do, burn their fingers. then there are mandatory farmers’ loans and education loans, which are always under the shadow of a write-off threat. ingenious banks fill their agricultural loan targets with gold loans., why is this the state of affairs? exposure to working on advances is not an absolute criterion for a bank officer for his or her career advancement. smart and risk-averse officers skip their assignment in credit-related work at the operational levels and find their way directly up to the top. thus, knowledge of the business of credit becomes a casualty from top to bottom., banks genuinely expect their staff members to be mediocre and obliging rather than skilled and informed. think of the disparate areas our bank manager is supposed to lay his or her hands on. kyc, insurance, aadhar, mutual funds, demat, pmjdy, subsidies, financial inclusion, alternate channels, scholarships, pension payments… the list is endless. to cap it all, demonetisation has taken its toll. all these areas come with targets and deadlines., items like mutual funds and insurance are lucrative for the staffer as they offer handsome commissions. of late, top management has started compelling operational staff to concentrate on non-banking areas such as mutual funds and insurance as the commission spread is top-heavy. offers such as foreign vacations for the top brass of banks are made by some insurance/mutual fund companies in addition to paying commissions. needless to add, this type of compulsions imposed on operational staff, more often than not lead to mis-selling. consequently their time is wasted on handling complaints and litigation. it is high time a study is made of the benefits to the bank from such lines of business. definitely individual benefits to bank staff will outweigh the benefits (even losses) that accrue to the bank., back on the subject, the thrust areas of banking — deposits and advances — have been relegated to the back-burner. no effort is made to garner quality advances as there is no incentive to do so. with desk-level officers ill-equipped to handle advances, the genuine customer is driven from pillar to post to get a loan. at last the decision is protruded to such a level that non-sanction will cause complaints. so an unwilling sanction is accorded and the amount is disbursed. from there on, the loan travels its route to becoming an npa due to lack of follow-up from the banker’s side and the lack of understanding from the borrower’s side. this is the case of small advances., the story of medium advances (say rs. 1 crore and above) is no better. it is a peculiar characterstic of psbs that their internal communication system is one-sided, that is, going from top to bottom. to bring in professionalism and objectivity, many banks have formed credit committees where these loans are discussed. here, whatever nonsense the senior-most (position-wise) member says will prevail. junior members never utter a word of dissent. the committee system provides a false sense of security for its members as accountability gets diluted. prudent and time-tested lending norms are violated in the guise of business considerations. when the sanction letter reaches the branches, they disburse the loan without adhering to sanctioning conditions. with the borrower’s indulgence and the banker’s apathy, sooner or later the loan turns into an npa., those seeking large advances invariably reach the bank with political clout. they corner the banker to get the loans on their own terms and the bankers relent. ultimately even their own terms are violated., the factors contributing to the present dilemma are not far to seek. indiscriminate selection of borrowers, inadequacies in loan processing, flawed follow-up mechanism, auditors’ negligence, the ineffectiveness of the judiciary, political appeasement and, above all, dissolute societal standards, deepen the crisis., analysing the reasons for this deep-rooted malaise, one can come to the conclusion that the country has to live with it. but certainly the intensity can be reduced and the damage minimised. some of the needed measures can be summarised thus:, 1. back to basics: psbs should shred the idea of becoming financial supermarkets, get away from incentive-centric insurance and mutual fund businesses, and get into the core areas of deposits and advances. governments also should allow the banks to concentrate on the core business., 2. specialisation: it should be recognised that handling advances requires specialised skill. each area of advances, namely, identification, processing, sanction, documentation, disbursement, maintenance, and recovery, should reclaim its sanctity. loan processing cells functioning in some of the banks should be strengthened. having hands-on experience in credit-handling should be a prerequisite for promotion to top management posts., 3. credit committees: entrusting the sanction of loans to committees is a good idea, but a committee of ‘yes-men’ will defeat the purpose. the composition of credit committees should be reviewed. in a senior-junior combination, the voice of the senior will prevail, even if the junior is right. it is suggested that the credit committee at each centre shall be headed by the seniormost official of the bank at the centre. other members can be a retired official who had sufficient credit exposure, and a chartered accountant. this will ensure proper vetting of the proposal and an objective and dispassionate evaluation.",0.09504416754416754,crisis indian banking,"news reports scams pour one , becoming clear credit

2018-03-05, no time for school: why lakhs of children are missing the bus,"the solution to india’s sanitation crisis lies in following simple hygiene practices. | photo credit: hul , swati is all of eight years old and the youngest of her parents’ four children. she goes to class 3 at a government primary school. when swati’s class teacher told her parents that she is one of the most intelligent and curious children in her class, they were the proudest parents in harnirpur. uttar pradesh. having dropped out early from school, swati’s parents wanted her to achieve a life that they could only dream of. they wanted her to finish her schooling and then go to college in the city. it was not just studies that swati liked to do. she could beat the boys of the village at cricket on her day and she is also being taught to sing by one of the didis, trained in classical music., swati’s parents do everything within their means to make sure that she grows up to become a very talented girl. so, her father makes sure he gets nutritious food especially for swati. but there is one thing that worries swati’s parents. she has been almost always sick. she has already fallen ill due to diarrhea twice this monsoon and half the monsoon has already passed. she has missed three weeks of classes and is now unable to comprehend her mathematics lessons. she is now visibly thinner and shorter than her cousin whose family lives in the city. the doctor at the taluk headquarters hospital tells the parents that swati is malnourished. her father has made sure that he has done everything right. in spite of that how swati has remained malnourished?, according to the national family health survey - 4 (nfhs-4) 2015-16, 38.4 per cent of india's children in the age group of 0-59 months are stunted which is substantially higher than the world average of 22.9% (joint malnutrition country dataset, may 2017, unicef, who and world bank group), as an emerging economic superpower, it is quite tragic that more than one in three children in india are stunted. stunting is defined by un1cef as the percentage of children, aged 0 to 59 months, whose height for age is below minus two standard deviations (moderate and severe stunting) and minus three standard deviations (severe stunting) from the median of the who child growth standards. stunting is associated with an underdeveloped brain, with long-lasting harmful consequences, including diminished mental ability and learning capacity, poor school performance in childhood, reduced earnings and increased risks of nutrition-related chronic diseases, such as diabetes, hypertension, and obesity in future. thus stunting can be classified by itself as an illness as it leads to negatively affecting the present and future of the child. multiple researchers have proven the link between illness and malnutrition/ stunting in children., these children’s bodies divert energy and nutrients away from growth and brain development to prioritize infection-fighting survival. when this happens during the first two years of life, children become stunted. what’s particularly disturbing is that, the lost height and intelligence are permanent” - jean humphrey, professor of human nutrition at johns hopkins bloomberg school of public health., higher economic growth and increased spending on nutrition access programmes have not resulted in proportionate decrease in child malnutrition or stunting. alternatively, research shows that india's issues can be explained through the lack of hygiene., in addition, 9.2 % of the children are suffering from diarrhea at any given point of time (prevalence of diarrhea (reported) in the last two weeks preceding the survey (%) -nfhs 2015-16). this leads to loss of school hours and an inability to enjoy their childhood fully., the causes for swati’s inability to reach her full potential is the same. swati, her family and the whole of her entire village defecate in the open. also, at her home, they do not boil or filter water before drinking. and the soap is only used for bathing and rarely used for washing hands. doctor saheb tells them that it is not enough to eat nutritious food, but the family must ensure that hygienic habits are followed., the solution to india's water, sanitation and hygiene crisis lies in 3 simple habits:haath,muh andbum, swati’s story is from last year. changes are visible in her village. the government has encouraged the villagers to build toilets as part of the swachh bharat mission. hindustan unilever limited's swachh aadat, swachh bharat has covered swati’s village as part of two of their initiatives. hul's factory workers have visited swati’s village as part of the swachhata doot initiative. using mobile phones they have spread the message of using and maintaining clean toilets, drinking boiled or filtered water and washing hands with soap and the villagers have promised to maintain the hygiene habits. a 21-day swachh aadat curriculum on right habits has been introduced in her school. today, all of her friends are messengers of change in their village. swati’s family follows the three clean habits. her future looks much brighter and the next mithali raj is in the making., “defecating in the open is the main cause of many diseases. not only does it cause damage to the drinking water and food that we consume, but also directly affects the functioning of human hands and legs., the women and children are mostly affected with anaemia. this is in fact caused by intestinal worms caused by the bacteria from the faeces caused by defecating in the open. the practice of using washrooms should be insisted right from childhood. it will bring an end to most of the diseases created."", -

2018-03-21,separate freedoms," , last year, before a nine-judge bench of the supreme court in k.s. puttaswamy v. union of india, the central government posited a frightening thesis. the constitution, it argued, does not recognise a fundamental right to privacy. one of the main planks of this submission revolved around a notion that privacy was a purely elitist concern, that a liberty of this kind, whenever and wherever it can be promised, will always be overridden by the government’s duties in a welfare state. the court, however, decidedly thought otherwise. indeed, its categorical rejection of the government’s arguments was a cause for much celebration. the court showed us, at least in theory, that it was willing to treat every citizen with equal dignity, care and respect, that the inviolability of rights was not conditional on a person’s position in society., “the refrain that the poor need no civil and political rights and are concerned only with economic well-being has been utilised through history to wreak the most egregious violations of human rights,” wrote justice d.y. chandrachud in his opinion on behalf of himself and three others. privacy, he added, could never be a privilege doled out only to a select few. “every individual in society irrespective of social class or economic status is entitled to the intimacy and autonomy which privacy protects… the pursuit of happiness is founded upon autonomy and dignity. both are essential attributes of privacy which makes no distinction between the birth marks of individuals.” justice r.f. nariman, in his separate opinion, was equally dismissive of the government’s arguments. there can be no “antipathy whatsoever between the rich and the poor,” he wrote, on the existence of a fundamental right to privacy., in its reach, however, the judgment in puttaswamy went even further. not only did the judges see a general guarantee of privacy as foundational, and as subject only to the limits on freedom expressly provided by the constitution’s language, but, even more significantly, a clear majority on the bench also placed their faith in a system that saw fundamental rights as unassailable, in a system where an individual will not be waiving her liberties simply by accepting grants and benefits from the government. in other words, the court acknowledged that the state wasn’t doing anyone a favour by providing them benefits and subsidies — these were as much an entitlement that sprang from the constitution as the other freedoms flowing from the document’s text., now, therefore, we must ask ourselves this: what brought about a volte-face in the supreme court’s thinking, in its interim order delivered on march 13, in the ongoing battle over the validity of the aadhaar programme? here, the court extended the government-mandated deadline on linking aadhaar to different services, including one’s banking and mobile phone accounts, until it delivers a final judgment. but, markedly, it refused to grant a similar extension for notifications made under section 7 of the aadhaar (targeted delivery of financial and other subsidies, benefits and services) act, 2016. these notifications make a person’s entitlement to a host of welfare schemes, including subsidy programmes, conditional on the individual possessing an aadhaar number. aren’t citizens enrolled to receive benefits from government entitled to the same freedoms as others?, originally, the state told us that by providing every indian a unique identity number, by collecting biometric information from us, including our fingerprints and iris scans, the government can ensure an equitable distribution of benefits to the poor. but there were many problems with this vision. for one, it lacked any legislative backing, and was, therefore, clearly introduced without due process. what’s more, the state displayed a complete lack of care or concern for a person’s right to privacy, in commencing a project which it couldn’t have even been sure would satisfy its purported objectives. after all, the government had barely conducted any disinterested study before the project was piloted to examine its costs and benefits. as a result, several petitions were filed in the supreme court, questioning the project’s constitutional validity., however, when these cases came up for hearing before a three-judge bench, in 2015, the government argued that the aadhaar programme couldn’t be questioned, because the constitution, in any event, didn’t guarantee any right to privacy. faced with this astonishing claim, the court, later that year, referred the cases to a larger bench, to answer what ought to really have been a rudimentary question: does the constitution recognise a fundamental right to privacy? while making this reference, though, the court also delivered a brief interim order., the production of an aadhaar card, it wrote, cannot be made mandatory for obtaining any benefits otherwise due to a citizen. additionally, aadhaar could only be used for a specific list of purposes, such as the enforcement of schemes under the public distribution system. in october that year, a bench modified this order to include certain other schemes for which aadhaar could be used, but, at the same time, was careful to clarify that the project was entirely voluntary and that no person could be compelled to enrol in the programme., in the meantime, in march 2016, even as these petitions were pending before the supreme court, the union government introduced in the lok sabha a draft legislation, in the form of a money bill, with a view to legitimising the creation of the unique identification authority of india (uidai), which runs the aadhaar programme. this law, the aadhaar act of 2016, describes enrolment with the uidai as voluntary. but, in section 7, it authorises both the central and state governments to make aadhaar mandatory for anyone wishing to receive a subsidy, benefit or service, for which expenses are borne from the consolidated fund of india. although this clause, at the same time, demands that the government must accept alternate proofs of identity from persons without an aadhaar number, since the law’s enactment the state has notified more than 130 schemes in which beneficiaries of different welfare measures have been mandated to enrol with the uidai. these programmes include schemes that affect access to the public distribution system, to mid-day meals for children, to pensions for the elderly, to public health care, to food subsidies under the national food security act, to maternity benefits, and to an array of other such necessities.",0.07866832779623477,separate freedoms,", last year , nine-judge bench supreme court k.s. puttaswamy v. union india , central government posited frightening thesis. constitution , argued , recognise fundamental right privacy. one main planks submission revolved around notion privacy purely elitist concern , liberty kind , whenever wherever promised , always overridden government ’ duties welfare state. court , however , decidedly thought otherwise. indeed , categorical rejection government ’ arguments cause much celebration. court showed us , least theory , willing treat every citizen equal dignity , care respect , inviolability rights conditional person ’ position society. , “the refrain poor need civil political rights concerned economic well-being utilised history wreak egregious violations human rights , ” wrote justice d.y. chandrachud opinion behalf three others. privacy , added , could never privilege doled select few. “every individual society irrespective social class economic status entitled intimacy autonomy privacy protects … pursuit happiness founded upon autonomy dignity. essential attributes privacy makes distinction birth marks individuals. ” justice r.f. nariman , separate opinion , equally dismissive government ’ arguments. “antipathy whatsoever rich poor , ” wrote , existence fundamental right privacy. , reach , however , judgment puttaswamy went even further. judges see general guarantee privacy foundational , subject limits freedom expressly provided constitution ’ language , , even significantly , clear majority bench also placed faith system saw fundamental rights unassailable , system individual waiving liberties simply accepting grants benefits government. words , court acknowledged state ’ anyone favour providing benefits subsidies — much entitlement sprang constitution freedoms flowing document ’ text. , , therefore , must ask : brought volte-face supreme court ’ thinking , interim order delivered march 13 , ongoing battle validity aadhaar programme ?

to enter into agreements with like-minded states for cross-border data sharing. this will allow law enforcement agencies from these states to directly obtain electronic data, held by communication

enforcement and, more importantly, to make headway in the global cyber norms conversation., today, to prevent, mitigate or prosecute even a routine crime, a police officer seeks timely access to electronic data. the data are often rendered inaccessible, largely due to two reasons. one, popular service providers increasingly store electronic communications in the cloud, breaking the data into “shards” and distributing the data across different countries. while these companies offer services in india, they do not store the data locally. two, the current u.s. law prohibits service providers from disclosing user data to foreign law enforcement agencies., the passing of the cloud act comes at a time when the problematic data gathering practices of cambridge analytica have occupied public discourse. the cloud act, however, symbolises the other, less explored side of the coin — when user data are sought for legitimate security needs., the current system is broken, india in the first

2018-04-30,hindustan unilever limited: spreading the message of swachh aadat across india,"for any nation-building project to triumph, it is essential that every stakeholder contributes to the initiative. the move towards cleanliness launched through the swachh bharat abhiyan by the prime minister of india, shri narendra modi, is one such mission. governments and government bodies, international development organizations, ngos and corporates have the resources to play significant roles in such movements. corporates have skill sets that are different from government and development sector organizations, and these have not been harnessed enough for contributing to national causes., hindustan unilever limited (hul), india’s largest fast moving consumer goods company believes in using its ability to understand every indian – an ability that the company acquired by serving indian consumers for 85 years, as well as promoting the national movement towards a cleaner

change in water, sanitation and hygiene (wash) habits. hul understands that behaviour change is as important as creating infrastructure like toilets and hand wash stations in schools, hence it is undertaking multiple programmes for instilling positive hygiene and sanitation behaviours., domex toilet academy is an on-ground sanitation intervention that deployed an entrepreneurial development model on ground building over one lakh toilets. a behavior change programme is currently being implemented in chittoor district in andhra pradesh to increase usage of toilets and encourage proper maintenance of toilets., the lifebuoy handwashing behaviour change programme is amongst the largest handwashing initiatives in the world. the initiatives help in promoting the benefits of handwashing

mobile phones. they reach out to school children, parents and community members thereby positively impacting rural communities. the programme has successfully reached over 30 lakh people with the message of cleanliness since inception., the swachh aadat curriculum is a 21- day behaviour change curriculum for primary school students. reaching them young ensures that the knowledge about the importance of clean habits and the positive attitudes towards clean habits are picked up early. the curriculum is taught in classrooms with the help of teachers for approximately 20 minutes for 21 continuous working days. the curriculum combines classroom teaching with practical demonstrations and characters, like chamatkari sonu (a superhero) and kitabyutor (kitab + computer), activities,

have increased their intake tremendously because they are quality institutes — the issue is one of oversupply because aicte cannot intervene. we wish to correct the act so that aicte’s reign continues in all engineering institutes, which is not the case right now., second, now students are choosing where they want to go, and obtain reviews before joining. so, in a way, lower quality institutes will go out and the good will stay. that is a good development. we received 100-150 applications for closure of colleges., it is always a case of somebody breaching the code. in bank atms, there is a foolproof arrangement, yet breaches happen. we will be alert. we have put processes in place. we don’t want to put more things in the public domain. our system is foolproof but if somebody breaches the system, it is a criminal act and the person will be tried under the law., it was one man’s hunger to become headmaster at an early stage, prompted by one lady who said she would help him become headmaster but he must give her two papers. these were the two papers that went viral on social media. that is what the leak was all about. all are arrested., the draft legislation has undergone many changes. first, it was an overarching architecture that the upa’s hrd minister kapil sibal wanted to bring and it was opposed by his own party members. we want to make the processes of the three regulators the same, with increased transparency., we are in the process of discussing it. we need to have more transparency, so that there is no malpractice or corruption. if it comes as a law, so be it., i don’t think so. actually, we don’t regulate anything. the whole inspection process is about the area, ownership and the building. nobody is talking about learning outcomes. nobody is talking about the teaching processes and placements. we want to shift the focus of the regulators to these areas., we have only updated and corrected it, which is a usual exercise. we do not have the committees to redraft and rewrite the curriculum and we have not formed a committee to do this. last year we asked teachers for their suggestions for updating and for correcting erroneous information. we received 1,100 suggestions and we have carried out a little over 700 suggestions., no, i don’t think so. since 2011, knowledge tradition and practices in india is a good course by the cbse. any student who reads that will get correct scientific information. we have only introduced government schemes like swachh bharat, make in india., i think the issue is settled. our mp asked for information on something and it was misunderstood., i would not like to comment on that., state universities don’t seek funds from us. private universities have nothing to ask from us. deemed universities also don’t ask from us. only central universities and centrally funded deemed universities are what the centre finances. as far as central finance is concerned, the centre will give all the money required., but in graded autonomy, this freedom given is their choice if they want to take it. we have not mandated that they have to take it. as far as centrally funded institutions are concerned, the fund regulations will apply. because if finance minister arun jaitley writes the budget, we can’t delegate budget-writing to institutes. so, they will have to submit financial approvals as regular financial approvals., autonomous colleges are not something we have invented. it has been there from the 1970s and there are 635 autonomous colleges working smoothly in our country. there are another 350 applications pending. so, we process them. as far as delhi university is concerned, we said it is not mandatory. it is your choice. as far as financial approvals are concerned, you will have to stick to our original framework. and academic freedom to conduct examinations, on the syllabus... that is the freedom they get. conducting the examination, evaluation of papers — everything remains with the college, if they want to. but if they don’t want, we are not mandating. we are also not increasing fees in any way because of this. but if they have to expand and they want to increase the budget, they will have to seek approval from the ministry.",0.12737345987345985,‘the government spending nearly 4 % gdp education ’,"union hrd minister prakash javadekar. , , bharatiya

2018-06-21,"accent on bhakti, social themes ","maya shivakumar , mulund fine arts society’s three-day ‘summer fiesta’ featured a dance performance and two tamil plays. it was held at the mahakavi kalidas auditorium, mulund., a bharatanatyam performance by maya g shivakumar was a last-minute substitute for the musical play ‘sangeetha pitamaha purandaradasa’, as its director p. s. krishnamoorthy was suddenly taken ill. , the dancer used lesser-known episodes from mythology and languages such as hindi, sanskrit, and kannada. slotting the supreme spirit as aadhar and the devotee as the aadhey, she depicted bhishma and draupadi, in a different light. shivakumar’s detailed anchoring and immaculate diction aided in the understanding of the presentation., a dialogue between draupadi and bhishma, where the former concealed in a ghunghat takes the latter’s blessing to be the eternal sumangali, thus binding him to protect her husbands, whom he had vowed to kill. bhishma knew this guile was part of krishna’s larger plan., to highlight bhakti rasa, the dancer portrayed how hanuman prefered servitude to rama instead of moksha and his lifting the mountain to bring the sanjeevani herb to save lakshmana. the underlying message was that without bhakta, bhagwan is incomplete, just like without hanuman, rama would be incomplete. for the sake of friendship, krishna became the humble charioteer of arjuna, ready to serve by cleaning his nail-pointed shoes which, otherwise, would be blasphemy., vishwaroopam was delineated beautifully. the lord chose yashoda as his mother to bless her with the sight of the universe in his baby mouth., the dichotomy of ‘anurag’ and the yearning experienced by gopis, the madhurya bhava of radha, established that there is no separation for anyone, as krishna is omnipresent. there is oneness in everything. the order of things is god, world and then the self., the second concept was of dharma and its upkeep. examples of bhishma and drona as symbols of loyalty were depicted. bhishma pierced all over and lying on the bed of arrows delivers a sermon on the role of a king. bhishma’s equipoise was highlighted all through., the story of newly-wed urmila, the lesser-acknowledged wife of lakshmana, who stayed back to fulfil her duties as a daughter-in-law was given an interesting and fresh interpretation. she ensured harmony at home, akin to rama and bharata, who ensured harmony in the kingdom., hanuman setting lanka ablaze, enhanced by use of strobe lights, made an impact. the sound effect of the dice game was well brought out., the performance ended with the assertion that right is the foundation of peace. the lines from upanishads were befitting in the finale., neat gestures and footwork and apt abhinaya, were a testimony to the training she received in sri rajarajeswari bharatanatya kala mandir under stalwart gurus such as mahalingam pillai and kalyanasundaram. , with sensitivity, ‘deiyvam thantha veedu’, a tamil drama by bombay cultural association was about a couple, who are orphans and adopt a woman from an old age home to provide their little son the affection of a grandmother. meera as the mother, yukesh as the little boy, meenalata, hari, pichai (happy-go-lucky old age home members ), ramki as the son, sathya as the daughter-in-law, vijayaraghavan as a well-meaning friend and others in the team, played their roles with sensitivity. , deivam thanta veedu meera jagannathan, story and scriptwriter, and jagannathan, director, with years of theatre experience, are the creative duo behind this play. the treatment and an unexpected twist in the tale (abandoned mother decides to stay with her adopted family instead of her biological son), added interest and freshness to the banal themes of

stop it, you rockstar, stop it., then comes some more super-good news. i speak of the primary aim of this apparel brand., apparently, patanjali paridhan will be mainly targeting women. isn’t that wonderful?

2018-08-18, no child left behind ,", the urgency to address poor nutrition in india, especially among children, adolescent girls and women is compelling, and re-confirmed in virtually every survey — from nfhs-4 in 2015-16 (the latest available information), to the global nutrition report 2016 and the global hunger index (ghi) 2017, which ranks india at 100 out of 119 countries, with a low overall score of 31.4. among children less than 5 years, wasting (low weight for height), continues to be 21% in the 2017 index — it was 20% in 1992. there has been a reduction in stunting (height for age) – from 61.9% in 1992 to 38.4% in 2017, reported in the ghi 2017. mortality among children less than 5 years old has declined to around 5% from 11% during the same period, according to both the ghi and the nfhs. however, 25% of india’s children less than 5 years old are still malnourished., add to this the fact that 190.7 million people in india sleep hungry every night, and over half of adolescent girls and women are anaemic, and the conclusion is obvious — despite a 7% compound annual growth rate over the last decade and the various programmes to improve nutrition, levels of under-nutrition are unacceptably high., this grim reality has rightly lead to a renewed emphasis to address the various forms of poor nutrition – stunted, wasted, anaemic and underweight children; anaemic girls and women, especially in the 15-49 age group. the recently announced flagship program of the ministry of women and child development will be anchored through the national nutrition mission (nnm), or poshan abhiyaan, with its own specific budget of ₹9,046 crore and a proposed world bank loan of $200 million, to ensure convergence among the various programmes of the government. additionally, niti aayog has worked on a national nutrition strategy (nns), isolated the 100 most backward districts for stunting and prioritised those for interventions., a cynical view would be that we have seen such declarations before – after all, the special attention to nutrition was highlighted in 2008 when the prime minister’s national council on india’s nutrition challenges was constituted. a detailed report, “addressing india’s nutrition challenges”, was submitted in 2010 by the planning commission, the convergence of an extensive and multi-sector consultation. but nothing changed significantly., the optimistic view says that exploring new models to address the structural and systemic issues on a priority basis, learning from what has worked or not, and single-minded focus on implementation will be critical to delivering better nutritional outcomes and meeting the sustainable development goals, to which india is a signatory. additionally, initiatives like swachh bharat abhiyan, where implemented, will contribute positively to nutrition outcomes, and well-structured public-private partnerships could be the catalyst., seen in this context, the overhaul of capacity and capability in three existing programmes, designed to reach populations most at risk, should be the first priority — namely, the integrated child development services (icds), with its network of 1.4 million anganwadi centres, reaching almost 100 million beneficiaries who include pregnant and nursing mothers and children up to 6 years; mid-day meals (mdm) that reach almost 120 million children in schools; and the public distribution system (pds) that reaches over 800 million people under the national food security act., the national nutrition strategy (nns) has set very ambitious targets for 2022 and the poshan abhiyaan has also specified three-year targets to reduce stunting, under-nutrition and low birth weight by 2% each year, and to reduce anaemia by 3% each year. for purposeful action, it is imperative to have common goals and metrics for improving nutrition, which can then be disaggregated by year, state, district, etc., into a nutrition dashboard, with metrics that are clear and measurable and a real-time tracking mechanism, much like we track economic data. it is interesting to note that the national nutrition monitoring bureau (nnmb), established in 1972, was dissolved in 2015., both the nns and the nnm have recognised the criticality of working collaboratively across ministries; yet both are silent on the constructive role that the private sector, development agencies and civil society can and must play in realising these ambitious goals. altering the fundamentals of poor nutrition requires multiple and sustained interventions over a period of time — increased availability and accessibility of nutritious food, potable water, hygiene and sanitation, primary health care, etc. the approach, commitment and resources therefore have to be inter-generational, multi-sector, multi-dimensional and multi-year. to simplify a complex issue, the challenge for india is to simultaneously address insufficient and poor diets, inadequate hygiene and sanitation and better management of disease and infections., success in this domain will be driven by coordinated action on multiple fronts, but there are at least three urgent priorities., one, to adequately re-engineer the icds, mdm and pds for greater effectiveness. this is an ideal initiative for public-private partnerships as the strength of good private sector companies is in creating and designing frameworks, structures, processes and metrics for action, implementation and tracking. for example, involving the best nutritionists to work with local communities on calorie and nutrition dense supplementary foods, using easily available local ingredients that are within the icds and mdm budget guidelines, and produced by self-help groups, could easily be anchored by the relevant private sector and development agencies, working with state governments, and considered a corporate social responsibility initiative. the key advantages of this disaggregated supply model are that it engages local communities, generates employment and ensures minimal leakage as it works with and inside the community. this will also ensure that space and other constraints of lack of hygiene at anganwadi centres do not become impediments in the supply of nutritious food., two, to mandate and scale staple food fortification comprising edible oil, wheat, rice and dairy products, in addition to salt. there is persuasive evidence from several countries of the efficacy and cost-effectiveness of large-scale staple food fortification to address “hidden hunger” or micro-nutrient deficiencies. the effectiveness of iodised salt in significantly reducing iodine deficiency is well-established in india empirically. the success of micro-nutrient fortified food is that it does not entail a change in behaviour. considerable work will also have to be done to make fortified rice and wheat available through the pds. this requires addressing the supply chain capability to deliver — another excellent ppp initiative, that has been piloted in several states for edible oil and wheat flour and can easily be replicated. a case in point is the mandate of july and august 2017 to use fortified oil, salt and wheat flour in the icds and mdm by the ministries of women and child development and human resource development, respectively. in the absence of coordination with industry to create an effective supply chain, this proposed intervention will be another missed opportunity. , mandatory fortification with micro-nutrients often sparks an emotional debate, and the way to think about it is that these universally consumed staple foods become the carriers of vitamins and minerals that people need but do not get in sufficient quantity from the food they consume.",0.11507183176300828,child left behind,", urgency address poor nutrition india , especially among children , adolescent girls women compelling , re-confirmed virtually every survey — nfhs-4 2015-16 ( latest available information ) , global nutrition report 2016 global hunger index ( ghi ) 2017 , ranks india 100 119 countries , low overall score 31.4. among children less 5 years , wasting ( low weight height ) , continues 21 % 2017 index — 20 % 1992. reduction stunting ( height age ) – 61.9 % 1992 38.4 % 2017 , reported ghi 2017. mortality among children less 5 years old declined around 5 % 11 % period , according ghi nfhs. however , 25 % india ’ children less 5 years old still malnourished. , add fact 190.7 million people india sleep hungry every night , half adolescent girls women anaemic , conclusion obvious — despite 7 % compound annual growth rate last decade various programmes improve nutrition , levels under-nutrition unacceptably high. , grim reality rightly lead renewed emphasis address various forms poor nutrition – stunted , wasted , anaemic underweight children ;

2018-08-22,swachh to target open urination too,"under new norms, cities and towns wanting to be declared odf+ (open defecation free plus) must also be free of public urination and not just open defecation. this is the first time that the swachh bharat mission (urban) is officially including the elimination of public urination in its agenda. , the rural division of sbm had previously said preventing public urination was not on their agenda., the mission is focussed on infrastructure and regulatory changes, on the assumption that this will lead to behaviour change. , “cities are different from rural areas,” sbm-u mission director vinod kumar jindal told the hindu. , “in the case of urban areas, the problem is not one of usage, but of availability...in cities, if toilets are available, accessible and clean, people will automatically use them rather than using the road.”, sustainability is key, the odf+ and odf++ protocols, which were released by the ministry of housing and urban affairs last week, are the next step for the sbm-u and aim to ensure sustainability in sanitation outcomes. , the original odf protocol, issued in march 2016, said, “a city/ward is notified as odf city/ward if, at any point of the day, not a single person is found defecating in the open.” so far, 2,741 cities have been certified as odf, based mostly on third-party verification of toilet construction., the new odf+ protocol, issued last week, says that a city, ward or work circle could be declared odf+ if, “at any point of the day, not a single person is found defecating and/or urinating in the open, and all community and public toilets are functional and well-maintained.”, the odf++ protocol adds the condition that “faecal sludge/septage and sewage is safely managed and treated, with no discharging and/or dumping of untreated faecal sludge/septage and sewage in drains, water bodies or open areas.” “urination has always been implied as part of the odf agenda,” said mr. jindal. “that’s why there is a subsidy for urinals, not just toilets.” however, he admits that third-party verification of odf areas, being carried out by the quality council of india, has not so far checked for public urination. that will be done under the odf+ protocol, he said., “it is currently impractical to include urination,” said nitya jacob, a water and sanitation policy expert. he pointed out that public urination, especially by men, is almost entirely a behaviour change issue. even men who have access to toilets use the roads as a public urinal., mr. jindal disagrees. “in urban areas, no one wants to do it. they are forced to do it because of the lack of clean toilets,” he said, emphasising the need for cleanliness, accessibility and visibility. the odf+ protocol lays down 20 specific conditions across cleanliness, support infrastructure, accessibility and operations and maintenance. , the mission is also pushing forward in its drive to get public toilets listed on google maps. a search for “toilets near me” will now display the location of public toilets in over 700 cities, and allow users to rate and review them. “if people can easily find a public toilet, they will not use the road,” said mr. jindal.

2018-08-25,swachh india review: knowledge to policy,"this far-reaching field study evaluates one of india’s most substantial policy commitments, the national rural health mission (nrhm), to arrive at telling and cautionary conclusions. the nrhm identifies 18 states as having weak public health indicators and health infrastructure; the major determinants here are nutrition, water, and sanitation. the mission, furthermore, requires state-level departments dealing with water and sanitation to promote local community involvement. , the research team, based at the centre for economic and social studies, hyderabad, completed the work in 12 months in 2015-16, studying madhya pradesh, odisha and andhra pradesh. the authors acknowledge ministry of health and family welfare funding and support from the ministry’s national health systems resource centre., comprehensive study, this is high-quality empirical social science; the research is meticulous and the book is easy to use. the tables provide a wealth of information; many also give chi-square test results and the corresponding significance levels. in addition, dozens of fieldwork photographs are reproduced., the authors start with a wide literature review, including research from peru and somalia among other countries, and note issues like the commodification of water. in each of the three chosen states, they cover direct health interventions on drinking water and sanitation, the processes whereby different institutions interact over nrhm goals, and the outcomes for individuals’ health and for community processes., the first hypothesis is that in open defecation-free (odf) villages, functioning local bodies and their interactions with panchayati raj institutions (pris) are better than they are in non-odf villages. the second is that the availability of protected water and sanitation may significantly impact household morbidity and the incidence of epidemics at the community level., the sampling could be a textbook example. the multi-stage selection starts with two high-focus nrhm states, madhya pradesh and odisha, and one non-high-focus state, andhra pradesh. in each selected state, the same method is applied to districts, blocks or mandals, and villages; in the study, 36 villages and 720 households figure, with one third of the villages being certified nirmal grams, where all houses, schools, and anganwadis or mother-and-child centres have access to sanitary toilets and all residents know the importance of personal and community hygiene, and of clean public spaces. the sampling frame also required each household to have a child up to the age of five, and included village size, location, class and caste profile, and the availability and quality of water and sanitation facilities., as for the findings, nirmal gram (ngp) villages are better only on certain indices, from infrastructure through water quality and availability to residents’ awareness of the village water and sanitation committees and village health and sanitation committees, and other local interactions. yet several practices, such as throwing small children’s faeces into the road, are common to both categories of villages., class issues, clear class divisions emerge across all villages, with poorer residents often unaware of the dangers of not washing fruit or vegetables before cooking or eating them; in addition, the poorest have to use sand or ash to clean their hands after defecation, as they have almost no easy access to clean water. all respondents, however, had at least one bath a day, though the care of drinking-water vessels varied by social class, as did water supply and water treatment before consumption., some of the figures are shocking. in madhya pradesh, only 13 of the 239 respondents were female, of whom only three were literate; in odisha, the corresponding figures were 30 and 240, with 27 women being literate; in andhra pradesh, 25 of 244 respondents were female, of whom 24 were literate., moreover, on certain health indices, the ngp villages are not much better than the non-ngp ones, despite evidence of official neglect in the latter. the authors conclude that the relevant similarities imply political factors in the selection of villages for ngp certification;

2018-09-29,the poor are left to themselves,"the first death anniversary of santoshi kumar, a dalit girl from simdega, jharkhand, was this week. she died of hunger, at the age of 11, a few weeks after her family’s ration card was cancelled by the state government because they failed to link it to aadhaar., the aadhaar judgment of september 26 provided an opportunity for the supreme court to make amends for her tragic death. the upholding (by and large) of section 7 by the majority judges is, therefore, the biggest let-down in the aadhaar judgment. this is because the judges decided to accept the government’s ‘assertions’ — wrongly — as ‘facts’., in the majority opinion, they state: “the entire aim behind launching this programme is the ‘inclusion’ of the deserving persons who need to get such benefits. when it is serving much larger purpose by reaching hundreds of millions of deserving persons, it cannot be crucified on the unproven plea of exclusion of some. we again repeat that the court is not trivialising the problem of exclusion if it is there.” (p. 389.) there are many instances of assertions being accepted as facts. this piece seeks to show why they were wrong in believing the assertion about inclusion, identification and exclusion, to illustrate the bigger problem with the majority view., for instance, the unique identification authority of india (uidai) submitted to the court that the ‘failed percentage’ of iris and finger authentication are 8.54% and 6%, respectively. later, on page 384, discussing the issue of exclusion, the judgment notes that the uidai is said to have claimed 99.76% “biometric accuracy”, suggesting that two different failure rates have been submitted to the court., though the uidai claims to have taken care of these failures by issuing a circular on october 24, 2017 (after santoshi’s death), to put in place an exemption mechanism, until then there was no exemption. even after the circular has been issued, there is little evidence of it being implemented. since 2017, there have been at least 25 hunger deaths that can be traced to aadhaar-related disruption in rations and pensions, of which around 20 deaths occurred after the aforementioned circular was issued., the idea that aadhaar enables inclusion has taken firm root in people’s minds, as well as the judges’. this belief, however, is misconceived. if it means that aadhaar is an easy id to get, that is perhaps true. only ‘perhaps’ because there are many people who have paid to get aadhaar even though it is meant to be free; many have had to try several times before they succeeded in getting it. those with any disability have found it very hard to enrol or have failed to enrol., the number of people excluded from getting aadhaar may be small (as a percentage of the population), but they happen to be the most vulnerable — bed-ridden old persons, victims of accidents, people with visual disabilities, etc., further, it is a misconception that for millions of indians, it is the only (or first) id they have. according to a response to an rti, 99.97% of those who got aadhaar numbers did so on the basis of existing ids., more importantly, no one in government has been able to explain how aadhaar enables inclusion into government welfare programmes. each government programme has its own eligibility criterion. in the public distribution system (pds), there are state-specific inclusion/exclusion criteria. in some states, if you have a government job or live in a concrete/pucca home, you cannot get a pds ration card — even if you have an aadhaar card., conversely, if you lived in a mud hut or were an adivasi, you would get a pds ration card. after the coming of aadhaar, on top of satisfying the state eligibility criteria, you need to procure and link your aadhaar number in order to continue to remain eligible for your pds ration card., before aadhaar was made mandatory, it was neither necessary (you could get subsidised pds grain without aadhaar), nor sufficient (possessing aadhaar alone did not entitle you to pds grain). with aadhaar being made compulsory, it has become necessary, but it is not sufficient to get welfare. it is a pity that the majority judges were unable to grasp this point., the biggest source of exclusion from government programmes (before and after aadhaar) remains the fact that india’s spending on welfare remains abysmally low. before the national food security act (nfsa), 2013 was implemented, roughly 50% of the indian population was covered by the pds. the nfsa expanded coverage to about two-thirds. this expansion of the pds is what has led to inclusion though exclusion errors persist in some areas (for example, regions such as western odisha where universal coverage is necessary)., the question that arises is, did the government misdiagnose the source of exclusion by blaming it on a lack of ids rather than inadequate budgets and faulty selection of eligible households? or, did the government purposely mislead the public on this issue because fixing the real problem would have entailed an increase in government spending?, either way, a very successful programme of propaganda was set in motion to convince people into believing that aadhaar was a project of inclusion and the ultimate tool against corruption in welfare programmes., the claims about what and how much aadhaar could do for reducing corruption in welfare were similarly blown out of proportion. for instance, quantity fraud (where a beneficiary is sold less than her entitlement, but signs off on the full amount) continues with aadhaar-based biometric authentication. a rogue dealer who i cannot easily hold to account can as easily force me to biometrically authenticate a purchase of 35 kg, but give me only 32 kg, as he could force me to sign in a register., meanwhile, the propaganda machinery again convinced people by repeating that the welfare rolls in india were full of fakes, ghosts, duplicates, etc. there was no reliable evidence on the scale of this problem (“identity fraud”). recent independent surveys and government data are beginning to suggest that it wasn’t the main form of corruption. linking aadhaar cards with the pds in odisha led to the discovery of 0.3% duplicates.",0.05483310549100024,poor left,"first death anniversary santoshi kumar , dalit girl simdega , jharkhand , week. died hunger , age 11 , weeks family ’ ration card cancelled state government failed link aadhaar. , aadhaar judgment september 26 provided opportunity supreme court make amends tragic death. upholding ( large ) section 7 majority judges , therefore , biggest let-down aadhaar judgment. judges decided accept government ’ ‘assertions ’ — wrongly — ‘facts ’ . , majority opinion , state : “the entire aim behind launching programme ‘inclusion ’ deserving persons need get benefits. serving much larger purpose reaching hundreds millions deserving persons , cannot crucified unproven plea exclusion some. repeat court trivialising problem exclusion there. ” ( p. 389. ) many instances assertions accepted facts. piece seeks show wrong believing assertion inclusion , identification exclusion , illustrate bigger problem majority view. , instance , unique identification authority india ( uidai ) submitted court ‘failed percentage ’ iris finger authentication 8.54 % 6 % , respectively. later , page 384 , discussing issue exclusion , judgment notes uidai said claimed 99.76 % “biometric accuracy ” , suggesting two different failure rates submitted court. , though uidai claims taken care failures issuing circular october 24 , 2017 ( santoshi ’ death ) , put place exemption mechanism , exemption. even circular issued , little evidence implemented. since 2017 , least 25 hunger deaths traced aadhaar-related disruption rations pensions , around 20 deaths occurred aforementioned circular issued. , idea aadhaar enables inclusion taken firm root people ’ minds , well judges ’ . belief , however , misconceived. means aadhaar easy id get , perhaps true. ‘perhaps ’ many people paid get aadhaar even though meant free ; many try several times succeeded getting it. disability found hard enrol failed enrol. , number people excluded getting aadhaar may small ( percentage population ) , happen vulnerable — bed-ridden old persons , victims accidents , people visual disabilities , etc. , , misconception millions indians , ( first ) id have. according response rti , 99.97 % got aadhaar numbers basis existing ids. , importantly , one government able explain aadhaar enables inclusion government welfare programmes. government programme eligibility criterion. public distribution system ( pds ) , state-specific inclusion/exclusion criteria. states , government job live concrete/pucca home , cannot get pds ration card — even aadhaar card. , conversely , lived mud hut adivasi , would get pds ration card. coming aadhaar , top satisfying state eligibility criteria , need procure link aadhaar number order continue remain eligible pds ration card. , aadhaar made mandatory , neither necessary ( could get subsidised pds grain without aadhaar ) , sufficient ( possessing aadhaar alone entitle pds grain ) . aadhaar made compulsory , become necessary , sufficient get welfare. pity majority judges unable grasp point. , biggest source exclusion government programmes ( aadhaar ) remains fact india ’ spending welfare remains abysmally low. national food security act ( nfsa ) , 2013 implemented , roughly 50 % indian population covered pds. nfsa expanded coverage two-thirds. expansion pds led inclusion though exclusion errors persist areas ( example , regions western odisha universal coverage necessary ) . , question arises , government misdiagnose source exclusion blaming lack ids rather inadequate budgets faulty selection eligible households ?

2018-09-29,external affairs minister sushma swaraj's statement at the 73rd session of the unga,"external affairs minister sushma swaraj addresses the 73rd united nations general assembly, at un headquarters on september 29, 2018. | photo credit: pti , september 29, 2018, your excellency madame president, , may i begin by congratulating you on your election as the president of the 73rd session of the united nations general assembly, on my personal behalf as well as on behalf of my country, india. as a woman, i feel doubly proud that you have this honour. i also recall, with equal pride, that the first woman to occupy this eminent chair was an indian smt. vijayalakshmi pandit, in 1953 during the 8th session. i will also like to thank the outgoing president mr. miroslav lajcak for successfully conducting the 72nd session of the united nations general assembly. , madame president, we received a very bad news this morning that there was an earthquake and tsunami- both these tragedies occurred at the same time - and from this forum on behalf of my country india i would like to express deep condolences to the people and government of indonesia and at the same time i would like to express assurance that india will cooperate in helping during this tragic time. , madame president, , the united nations is the world’s premier multilateral organization: , 1: where nations seek balm for the wounds of history, and a platform for solutions. , 2: where less developed nations sit with their more fortunate brethren to formulate plans that can correct the skewered economic imbalance. , 3: where new goals are set, and route maps defined, to make our world a better place. , in 2015, we established 2030 as a critically important horizon for 17 sustainable development goals. a common refrain, from 2015, has been that we will reach that horizon only if india finds its way to this destination. otherwise, we shall fail., i assure this august gathering through you, madam, that india will not let you fail. we are totally committed to achieving these objectives for our own people. under the leadership of prime minister narendra modi, india has initiated unprecedented economic and social transformation that will help india achieve its sdg goals much before time. , let me offer a few glimpses of evidence to illustrate what is the world’s biggest exercise in poverty elimination and social transformation: , through the jan dhan yojana, world’s largest financial inclusion scheme, over 320 million indians, who had never crossed the door of a bank before, now have bank accounts. this has enabled the poor to receive allotments from the government’s welfare programmes into their personal accounts, through direct benefit transfer, which has ended waste and corruption in the system. , similarly, ayushman bharat, the world’s biggest health insurance programme, was launched by prime minister modi a few days ago on 23rd september. this revolutionary scheme will benefit 500 million indians, who will get an insurance cover of rs 500,000 per family per year. we have a prayer in india: sarve santu niramaya, which means, all should be healthy. the aayushman bharat yojana is the answer to this prayer. , similarly, we have launched the largest housing scheme in the world aimed at ensuring that everyone has a roof above their heads. under the scheme, we have set ourselves a target of nealy 21 million homes by 2022. so far, over five million homes for the poor have already been constructed. , similarly, two extremely effective schemes have been initiated to raise the skill levels of those waiting to be employed through skill development programme and to turn the poor into entrepreneurs, through the mudra programme. i want to stress that over 140 million indians have taken mudra loans. the most significant aspect of mudra scheme is that 76% of the beneficiaries are women., at the heart of prime minister modi’s transformative vision is a radical idea: that the uplift of any nation is best achieved through the all-round empowerment of women. all the schemes that i have just spoken about have the welfare of women at their core. last year, i spoke about the ujjawala scheme, in which i am happy to report 50 million free gas connections have been provided so far. , another such initiative is the maternity benefit scheme, in which women get 26 weeks of paid leave to care for their newborn. madame president, as a woman, you will understand better than most how vitally important this programme is for every mother. some developed nations with huge economies do not offer more than six weeks paid leave, leading to a continuing struggle for more time off. in india, we have implemented what women across the world need. , madam president, in 2022, free india will be 75 years old. prime minister narendra modi has pledged to build a new india by then. this new india will be: , 1: swachh bharat, swasth bharat (clean india, healthy india); , 2: samarth bharat, surakshit bharat (prosperous india, secure india); , 3: shikshit bharat, viksit bharat (educated india, developed india); , 4: urjawan bharat, shaktiman bharat (energised india, strong india). , that is our horizon for india in 2022. we will reach that horizon. , madam president: , the biggest challenge of our era comes from the existential threats of climate change and terrorism. , under-developed and developing nations are the worst victim of climate change. they have neither the capacity nor the resources to meet this crisis. those who have exploited nature for their immediate needs cannot abdicate their responsibilities. if we have to save the world from the adverse effects of climate change, then developed nations must lift the deprived with financial and technical resources. the principle of common and differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities was reiterated in the 2015 paris agreement. , india has risen to meet the challenge of climate change. prime minister modi in partnership with france launched the international solar alliance. the united nations has recognized their contributions and conferred on prime minister modi and president macron the honour of un champions of the earth. i am happy to inform you that 68 nations are now members of isa. in march this year, india and france chaired the founding conference of isa in which 120 countries participated. , our prime minister has described his vision of sustainable and available energy in a typically apt phrase: one sun, one grid. this breakthrough concept can become the solution we seek to the problems. , madam president, i had described terrorism as the second existential threat to humanity. we imagined that the arrival of the 21st century would bring with it an age of common good, defined by cooperation in the quest for peace and prosperity. but here in new york, the horrific tragedy of 9/11, and in mumbai the catastrophe of 26/11 became the nightmares that shattered our dreams. the demon of terrorism now stalks the world, at a faster pace somewhere, a slower pace elsewhere, but life-threatening everywhere. , in our case, terrorism is bred not in some faraway land, but across our border to the west. our neighbour’s expertise is not restricted to spawning grounds for terrorism; it is also an expert in trying to mask malevolence with verbal duplicity., the most startling evidence of this duplicity was the fact that osama bin laden, the architect and ideologue of 9/11 was given safe haven in pakistan. america had declared osama bin laden it’s most dangerous enemy, and launched an exhaustive, worldwide search to bring him to justice. what america perhaps could not comprehend was that osama would get sanctuary in a country that claimed to be america’s friend and ally: pakistan. eventually, america’s intelligence services discovered the truth of this hypocrisy, and its special forces delivered justice. but pakistan continued to behave as if nothing had happened. pakistan’s commitment to terrorism as an instrument of official policy has not abated one bit. neither has its belief in hypocrisy. the killers of 9/11 met their fate; but the mastermind of 26/11 hafiz saeed still roams the streets of pakistan with impunity. , what is heartening is that the world is no longer ready to believe islamabad. fatf, for instance, has put pakistan on notice over terror funding. , madam president, we are accused of sabotaging the process of talks. this is a complete lie. we believe that talks are the only rational means to resolve the most complex of disputes. talks with pakistan have begun many times. if they stopped, it was only because of pakistan’s behavior. there have been many governments in india, by many different parties. each government has tried the peace option. prime minister modi, by inviting the heads of the saarc nations, to his swearing in ceremony, began his attempt for dialogue on his very first day in office. on 9th december 2016, i personally went to islamabad and offered a comprehensive bilateral dialogue. but soon after, pak sponsored terrorists attacked our air force base in pathankot on 2nd january. please explain to me how we could pursue talks in the midst of terrorist bloodshed? even now, after the new government came to power, the prime minister of pakistan imran khan wrote to prime minister modi suggesting a meeting between foreign ministers in new york. we accepted the proposal. but, within hours of our acceptance, news came that terrorists had killed three of our jawans. does this indicate a desire for dialogue? , time and again, pakistan accuses india of human rights violations. who can be a greater transgressor of human rights than a terrorist? those who take innocent human lives in pursuit of war by other means are defenders of inhuman behavior, not of human rights. pakistan glorifies killers; it refuses to see the blood of innocents. , it has become something of a habit with pakistan to throw the dust of deceit and deception against india in order to provide some thin cover for its own guilt. the united nations has seen this before. last year, pakistan’s representative, using her right to reply, displayed some photographs as ""proof” of ""human rights violations” by india. the photographs turned out to be from another country. similar false accusations have become a part of its standard rhetoric. , madam president: , each year, for last five years, india has been arguing from this podium that lists are not enough to check terrorists and their protectors. we need to bring them to accountability through international law. , in 1996, india proposed a draft document on ccit at the united nations. till today, that draft has remained a draft, because we cannot agree on a common language. on the one hand, we want to fight terrorism; on the other, we cannot define it. this is why terrorists with a price on their head are celebrated , finances and armed as liberation heroes by a country that remains a member of the united nations. cruelty and barbarism are advertised as heroism. the country prints postage stamps glorifying terrorists. if we do not act now, we will have to deal with conflagration later. once again, i appeal to this august body to come to an agreement, soon, on ccit as one of the necessary measures in a long running war. , madam president, i began by highlighting the unique and positive role of the un: but i must add that step by slow step, the importance, influence, respect and value of this institution is beginning to ebb. it is time to wonder if we are wandering towards the fate of the league of nations. if 2030 is the agreed deadline for delivery on sustainable development goals, then it also marks hundred years of the lapse of the league into irrelevance. surely there is something to learn from this coincidence? the league went into meltdown because it was unwilling to accept the need for reform. we must not make that mistake. , the united nations must accept that it needs fundamental reform. reform cannot be cosmetic. we need change the institution’s head and heart to make both compatible to contemporary reality. , reform must begin today; tomorrow could be too late. if the un is ineffective, the whole concept of multilateralism will collapse. in this session, there has been much debate about multilateralism. we will never weaken the multilateral mechanism. india believes that the world is a family, and the best means of resolution is shared discourse. a family is shaped by love and is not transactional; a family is nurtured by consideration not greed; a family believes in harmony not jealousy. greed breeds conflict; consideration leads to resolution. that is why the united nations must be based on the principles of the family. the un cannot be run by the ‘i’, it only works by the ‘we’. , india does not believe that the united nations should become the instrument of a few at the cost of the many. india believes that we must move forward together or we sink into the swamp of stagnation. , madam president, this year india will celebrate the 150th birth anniversary of mahatma gandhi. the mahatma’s favourite bhajan was ""vaishnav jan to tene kahiye”. the essence is deeply moving and quintessentially important: he who understands the pain of another, and absorbs it as his own, is a good human being. he who sees this pain, and helps without becoming arrogant, is a good human being’. , madam president, we have to make this assembly into a platform of understanding, assistance and true justice. we have to understand the pain of other nations, and work with developed nations to ease and eliminate this pain. arrogance has no place in our scheme of things; arrogance is counter-productive and self-defeating. let us work for the benefit of the less fortunate. let us work for a world where there is peace, serenity and shared prosperity; a world that is free from terrorism, tension and violence. , it is with this wish in mind that i end with a shloka from our sanskrit scriptures: , may all experience well being;, may all experience peace;",0.12501983046893222,external affairs minister sushma swaraj ' statement 73rd session unga,"external affairs minister sushma swaraj addresses 73rd united nations general assembly , un headquarters september 29 , 2018. &#124;

2018-10-01,"letters to the editor — october 1, 2018","the supreme court’s verdict in the sabarimala case is welcome. now the challenge and task before the kerala government lies in dealing with the logistics of managing an even larger crowd of pilgrims. perhaps the temple should be kept open all through the year. thought has to be given to transportation facilities, sanitation, food and drinking water. proper arrangements have also to be put in place to ensure foolproof safety and security of women., balachandran nair,, konni, kerala,, the verdict is a reminder of how valued cultural and religious symbols and institutions can have their narrative changed with just the stroke of the judiciary’s pen. i recall my father’s preparations for his pilgrimage to the temple when he was about 20 (he would have been 103 had he been alive). he went through the extreme rigours of staying away from his home, taking shelter in a shrine nearby, cooking his own meal using raw rice, and subsisting on just one meal a day for 41 days before starting out. this was just to avoid contact with women, who included his mother, grandmother and other senior female members, who in turn felt respected by such action rather than insulted as one would today assume. of course such rigour is no longer observed. but such practices and memories are what make the sabarimala experience unique. things will no longer be the same again., s. jagathsimhan nair,, thiruvanathapuram, the lone dissenting judge, justice indu malhotra, has rightly said that the court cannot impose its morality or rationality with respect to the form of worship of a deity. ancient traditions and practices differ from temple to temple in this vast land of unity amidst diversity. stream-rolling of diverse traditions and cultures is something courts would do well to avoid., kangayam r. narasimhan,, chennai, i wonder whether judicial thought went into the far-reaching implications of the verdict. it is fine to be talking about equality when it comes to worship, but the sabarimala temple has its own set of unique issues. it is essentially a temple that shares valuable space with one of india’s premier biosphere reserves. with the number of pilgrims expected to increase manifold now, and safe and secure facilities having to be created for women pilgrims, it stands to reason that this would mean carving out more land from the adjacent and shrinking periyar tiger reserve, which is already facing numerous pressures and unaddressed environmental concerns. no heed has been paid to detailed reports of the impact of plastic waste on wildlife and the release of untreated human waste in the forest areas and surrounding water bodies, especially during the pilgrimage season. given this unique problem, the top court should have taken its time before pronouncing its verdict. the ecosystem around sabarimala should not be given short shrift., kaveri medappa,, bengaluru, , it is most shocking that four years after swachh bharat, there are still sections of society which can get their next meal only if engaged in manual scavenging (page 1, ‘sunday special’ –“four years after swachh: cleaning excreta for roti”, september 30). it is clear that data on rural areas being open defecation free appear to be bogus and need to be revisited as one is sure to find many more santa devis across india. how many more dark, dehumanising days are there to be in their lives?

2018-10-03,‘swachh bharat has become a people’s movement’,"parameswaran iyer, secretary to the drinking water and sanitation ministry. | photo credit: v.v. krishnan , in his office, parameswaran iyer keeps a countdown calendar to october 2, 2019, the deadline for all of india to become ‘open-defecation free’. on tuesday, the countdown dipped to ‘365 days left’. despite some aberrations, the swachh bharat abhiyan-gramin has taken massive strides towards its goal. but mr. iyer knows that his biggest test will come after the countdown reaches zero: sustaining the gains will be the toughest challenge, he says. excerpts:, first, the fact that this programme has really caught on as a jan andolan. it has become a ‘people’s movement’. it has captured the imagination of the country. it has addressed centuries-old practices on open defecation, and it has had major health and economic impact. a recent world health organisation (who) report has said that by the time swachh bharat ends in 2019, more than 3,00,000 lives would have been saved., we have got the numbers: 24 states have become open-defecation free. the number of toilets built is 8.6 crore. sanitation coverage has gone up from 39% when we started four years ago to over 93% today. what is even more significant is that, according to the most recent independent survey, as part of a world bank-supported project, the usage of the toilets is 93%., that really shows that this whole behavioural change programme that is at the heart of swachh bharat — there is evidence that it is really working. behavioural change at scale — i think that was the biggest challenge., we are very clear that this programme is primarily about changing behaviour. now, obviously you need the infrastructure. we are trying to separate human contact with excreta and the most cost-efficient way of doing that is by providing a toilet. they have to be built, and there has been a remarkable increase in the number of toilets. but we are more interested in toilet usage., we deploy tools at two levels. one is through mass media, the other through interpersonal communication. we have been working on developing an army of foot soldiers called swachhagrahis, grass-root level motivators trained in community approaches and they go out to trigger behavioural change. they get their communities to accept responsibility and accountability. that ground game, that interpersonal communication, is important not just to achieve open defecation free (odf) status, but also to sustain it., and they’re being used., you have touched upon a very important point: sustaining the gains of odf. this is one of the biggest differences between this programme and the previous ones. we have a parallel programme called odf sustainability — and we have not lost contact with states that have become odf. there is continued engagement. there is also focus on ‘odf plus’, which is about solid and liquid waste management and swachhata in general., let me just take you through the process of declaration of a state as odf. it’s quite rigorous. first, there is self declaration by the village in an open aam sabha. then there is verification by an agency from the district level or block level. then, the state government sometimes does sample verification and so do we. so, the process is fairly robust, and then we have got this national rural annual survey., if there are specific cases in rajasthan, they need to be addressed. whenever we get a case where someone reports to us that somewhere there is a problem on the ground, or a toilet is not constructed, or someone is still going out to the open — they may be isolated cases — we refer it to the state., all the feedback we get from our colleagues on the ground says that one of the reasons this programme is so successful is because of the energy, the enthusiasm of the campaign. the fact that it has been done in campaign mode is what brings everyone together. the earlier approach was: ‘drip, drip, drip’. you don’t get anywhere with a ‘drip, drip’ method. you have got to build up momentum., if you talk to the collectors, all the people who were the pioneers for their districts, whether it is in bengal or whether it’s in rajasthan, all of them said, “if you don’t do this in campaign mode, if you don’t get everyone in the district together, all segments, elected representatives, women, swachhagrahis, sarpanchs, it is very difficult to do it over an extended period of time. you cannot sustain the enthusiasm.”, we have reached 93% coverage and eventually, we are going to get to 100%, and i think well before the october 2019 deadline set by the prime minister., i think it is really important now to focus upon sustaining the odf status. in some ways, this is even more challenging than achieving it in campaign mode, because this is something that has to be done on a continuous basis. people have got to understand that sustaining the gains is going to take time, it has got to get ingrained., this is something we have been focussing on and we have got to focus even more. we are convinced that this twin-pit model, which can be used in most parts of rural india, can actually create a treatment plant in itself. the big problem with septic tanks is the disposal of the sludge. sludge management is not a problem when you talk of the twin pit. now of course, that needs to be propagated better, so we are now trying to market it as a colour tv, not as a black and white tv. we have got some of our swachh bharat ambassadors like amitabh bachchan and akshay kumar doing promotion. masons are being trained. we have got a big collaboration with the ministry of skill development., typically, for a family of four or five, five to six years., this is part of the training and the awareness campaign, that when one of your pits fills up, in five to six years, this is what you need to do. you need to divert it to the second pit. when the first pit is closed for more than a year, then you can take out the compost. it is harmless, pathogen-free, and it is a great organic fertiliser., part of the training we are providing is about retrofitting. wherever there are deficiencies in construction, in some cases where there are single pits, you can retrofit them to second pits., in a rural context, just to put it in perspective, the focus has been on conversion of insanitary toilets — dry latrines — to sanitary ones. and work has been going on on for the last three years and the reports we have received from the states are that this conversion is complete... we are also continuously monitoring this... but reports indicate that that has been taken care of in rural india., yes., i don’t know about specific cases. i have to tell you that one of the big outcomes of the swachh bharat mission is that communities have come together. we think that the programme has actually broken these caste barriers.",0.14774877899877906,‘swachh bharat

2018-10-17,andhra pradesh hamlets shine in rural survey,"kuligod in karnataka’s belagavi district is the country’s best developed village, but more than a third of the gram panchayats ranked in the top 10 are in andhra pradesh, according to the findings of an ongoing rural development ministry survey., with multiple panchayats assigned the same score – and thus tied at the same ranking – there are 97 panchayats in the top 10 ranks. of these, 37 panchayats are in andhra pradesh while 24 are in tamil nadu. , villages from other states are represented only in single digits. of the states going to the polls next month, telengana and madhya pradesh have five and four panchayats in the top 10 ranks respectively., the rural development ministry has done a gap analysis of more than 3.5 lakh villages, in more than 1.6 lakh panchayats under the mission antyodaya convergence scheme. a team of officials surveyed and scored village level facilities and amenities using parameters related to infrastructure, economic development and livelihood, irrigation facilities, health, nutrition and sanitation, women’s empowerment, and financial inclusion., while in october 2017, an initial baseline survey was carried out in 50,000 gram panchayats, this year, the exercise is expected to cover all of the country’s 2.5 lakh panchayats by the end of november. the rankings will be updated as more panchayats are included, the ministry said., at the national level, the data shows progress in some areas and also spotlights discrepancies in respect of targets met under some other government schemes., for example, the survey reveals that more than 95% of villages have electricity available for domestic use, while the government had earlier this year claimed that 100% of villages had power connections., similarly with regard to sanitation, the survey shows only 58% of villages — slightly more than 2 lakh of the 3.5 lakh surveyed villages — are open defecation free (odf). however, according to the swachh bharat abhiyan-gramin, 5.13 lakh of india’s 6 lakh villages are already odf., the survey also shows only 21% of villages having a community waste disposal system. , about a quarter of all villages have more than 75% of households using clean energy, such as lpg or biogas., the survey indicates moderate progress in the rural housing scheme: less than 10% of the villages have more than 80% of their houses with kachha walls and roofs, indicating temporary structures. more than 73% of the villages are connected with an all-weather road., financial inclusion still has some way to go, with less than 15% of villages having banks, while just more than 10% have atms. while more than 26% of villages have post office facilities, only 8% have a soil testing centre and
