2009-07-05,full text of pranab's budget speech," here's the full text of the speech by finance minister pranab mukherjee in parliament on monday.madam speaker,i rise to present the budget for 2009-10.just 140 days back, i had the privilege to present the interim budget for 2009-10. it is a rare honour that i have been called upon to present the regular budget after the new government assumed office.the congress-led upa government has come back to power with a renewed mandate. as prime minister, dr. manmohan singh, said recently ""it is a mandate for continuity, stability and prosperity. it is a mandate for inclusive growth and equitable development."" it is a mandate that we accept with humility and a firm resolve to do all that we can for the welfare of this nation.i am deeply conscious of the faith reposed by the people in our government and the responsibilities that come with it. i am sensitive to the great challenge of rising expectations of a young india . it reflects a population that is restless, yet engaged and is ready to seize the opportunities that it is presented with. there are new and powerful reasons for us to create, facilitate and sustain those opportunities.in the interim budget for 2009-10, i had stated that the new government would need to anchor its policies for 2009-10, in a medium term perspective that would have to:(a) sustain a growth rate of at least 9 per cent per annum over an extended period of time;(b) strengthen the mechanisms for inclusive growth for creating about 12 million new work opportunities per year;(c) reduce the proportion of people living below poverty line to less than half from current levels by 2014;(d) ensure that indian agriculture continues to grow at an annual rate of 4 per cent;(e) increase the investment in infrastructure to more than 9 per cent of gdp by 2014;(f) support indian industry to meet the challenge of global competition and sustain the growth momentum in exports;(g) strengthen and improve the economic regulatory framework in the country;(h) expand the range and reach of social safety nets by providing direct assistance to vulnerable sections;(i) strengthen the delivery mechanism for primary health care facilities with a view to improve the preventive and curative health care in the country;(j) create a competitive, progressive and well regulated education system of global standards that meets the aspiration of all segments of the society; and(k) move towards providing energy security by pursuing an integrated energy policy.the government recognizes the challenges that this task entails, particularly at a time when the world is still struggling with an unprecedented financial crisis and an economic slowdown that has also affected india . while we are determined to convert our words into deeds, members would appreciate that a single budget speech cannot solve all our problems, nor is the union budget the only instrument to do so. yet, it is an important means to share the vision of the government, particularly as we begin a new term. i propose to do just that for the next hour or so, as i dwell on the challenges and outline the approach of the government in the short term and medium term perspectives.the first challenge is to lead the economy back to the high gdp growth rate of 9 per cent per annum at the earliest. growth of income is important in itself, but it is as important for the resources that it brings in. these resources provide us with the means to bridge the critical gaps that remain in our development efforts, particularly with regard to the welfare of the vulnerable segments of our population.the second challenge is to deepen and broaden the agenda for inclusive development; and to ensure that no individual, community or region is denied the opportunity to participate in and benefit from the development process.the third challenge is to re-energize government and improve delivery mechanisms. our institutions must provide high quality public services, security and the rule of law to all citizens with transparency and accountability.overview of the economymadam speaker, at the time of the presentation of the interim budget, i had given a detailed analysis of the economic situation. without repeating myself, i would like to highlight that the development course charted by the upa government in the last five years has been possible due to a step up in the growth rate of the economy and improved revenue buoyancy. the principal growth driver in this period has been private investment, which has been predominantly funded by domestic resources. during the year 2008-09, there has been a dip in the growth rate of gdp from an average of over 9 per cent in the previous three fiscal years to 6.7 per cent. it has affected the pace of job creation in certain sectors of the economy and the investment sentiments of the business community. it has also resulted in considerably lower revenue growth for the government. another feature of the year 2008-09 was a sharp rise in the wholesale price index to nearly 13% in august 2008 and an equally sharp fall close to 0% in march 2009. while a detailed analysis of the developments has been presented in the economic survey-2008-09, tabled in both houses of parliament last thursday, i draw your attention to a few aspects.the structure of india 's economy has changed rapidly in the last ten years. external trade and external capital flows are an important part of the economy and so is the contribution of the services sector to the gdp at well over 50 per cent. the share of merchandise trade (exports plus imports) as a proportion of gdp has more than doubled over the past decade to 38.9 per cent in 2008-09. similarly, trade in goods and services taken together has also doubled to 47 per cent during this period. gross capital flows rose to a peak of over 9 per cent of gdp in 2007-08 before falling in the wake of the global financial crisis. the significant increase in the inflow of foreign capital is important, not so much for bridging the domestic savings-investment gap, but for facilitating the intermediation of financial resources to meet the growing needs of the economy.this growing integration of the indian economy with the rest of the world has brought new opportunities and also new challenges. it has made the task of sustaining high growth more complex. over the past month, we have critically evaluated government's efforts at both short term economic recovery as well as medium term economic growth. the economic recovery and growth is a cooperative effort of the central and state governments. that is why, for the first time, i held a meeting with finance ministers of states as part of the preparations for this budget. i intend to make this an annual feature.towards economic revivalshort-term measuresto counter the negative fallout of the global slowdown on the indian economy, the government responded by providing three focused fiscal stimulus packages in the form of tax relief to boost demand and increased expenditure on public projects to create employment and public assets. the rbi took a number of monetary easing and liquidity enhancing measures to facilitate flow of funds from the financial system to meet the needs of productive sectors.this fiscal accommodation led to an increase in fiscal deficit from 2.7 per cent in 2007-08 to 6.2 per cent of gdp in 2008-09. the difference between the actuals of 2007-08 and 2008-09 constituted the total fiscal stimulus. this fiscal stimulus at 3.5% of gdp at current market prices for 2008-09 amounts to rs.1,86,000 crore.these measures were effective in arresting the fall in growth rate of gdp in 2008-09 and we achieved a growth of 6.7 per cent. there are signs of revival in the domestic industry and the foreign investors have also returned to the indian market in the last couple of months. it is possible that the two worst quarters since the global financial meltdown in september 2008 are behind us. while the global financial conditions have shown improvement over the recent months, uncertainties relating to the revival of the global economy remain. we cannot, therefore, afford to drop our guard. we have to continue our efforts to provide further stimulus to the economy.madam speaker, what i unfold now are only the 'first steps'. it will be my endeavour to make the process of budget formulation more participatory and a continuous exercise.infrastructure developmentto stimulate public investment in infrastructure, we had set up the india infrastructure finance company limited (iifcl) as a special purpose vehicle for providing long term financial assistance to infrastructure projects. we will ensure that iifcl is given greater flexibility to aggressively fulfil its mandate.'takeout financing' is an accepted international practice of releasing long term funds for financing infrastructure projects. it can be used to effectively address the asset liability mismatch of commercial banks arising out of financing infrastructure projects and also to free up capital for financing new projects. iifcl would, in consultation with banks, evolve a 'takeout financing' scheme which could facilitate incremental lending to the infrastructure sector.government has had some success in attracting private investment in a wide range of infrastructure sectors such as telecommunications, power generation, airports, ports, roads and even in railways through public private partnerships ( ppp ). to ensure that infrastructure projects do not face financing difficulties arising from the current downturn, as i indicated in my interim budget speech, the government has decided that iifcl will refinance 60 per cent of commercial bank loans for ppp projects in critical sectors over the next fifteen to eighteen months. the iifcl and banks are now in a position to support projects involving a total investment of rs.100 thousand crore in infrastructure. combined with the steps we are taking to increase public investment in infrastructure, this will provide a big boost to such investment.the investment in infrastructure for the growth of economy is critical. i have urged my colleagues in the central and state governments to remove policy, regulatory and institutional bottlenecks for speedy implementation of infrastructure projects. i, on my part, will ensure that sufficient funds are made available for this sector.highway and railwaysthe allocation during the current year to national highways authority of india (nhai) for the national highways development programme (nhdp) is being stepped up by 23 per cent over the 2008-09 (be). i have also increased the allocation for the railways from rs.10,800 crore made in the interim budget for 2009-10 to rs.15,800 crore.urban infrastructurethe jawaharlal nehru national urban renewal mission (jnnurm) has been an important instrument for refocusing the attention of the state governments on the importance of urban infrastructure. in recognition of the role of jnnurm, the allocation for this scheme is being stepped up by 87 per cent to rs.12,887 crore in the current budget. to improve the lot of the urban poor, i propose to enhance the allocation for housing and provision of basic amenities to urban poor to rs.3,973 crore in the current year's budget. this includes the provision for rajiv awas yojana (ray), a new scheme announced in the address of the president of india. this scheme, the parameters of which are being worked out, is intended to make the country slum free in the five year period.brihan mumbai storm water drainage project (brimstowa)to address the problem of flooding in mumbai, brihan mumbai storm water drainage project (brimstowa) was initiated in 2007. the entire estimated cost of the project at rs.1,200 crore is being funded through central assistance. a sum of rs.500 crore has been released for this project upto 2008-09. i have enhanced the provision for this project from rs.200 crore in interim be to rs.500 crore to expedite the completion of the project.powerthe accelerated power development and reform programme (apdrp) is an important scheme for reducing the gap between power demand and supply. i propose to increase the allocation for this scheme to rs.2,080 crore, a steep increase of 160 per cent above the allocation in the be of 2008-09.gaswith the recent find of natural gas in the kg basin on the eastern offshore of the country, the indigenous production of natural gas is set to double with natural gas emerging as an important source of energy. lng infrastructure in the country is also being expanded. government proposes to develop a blueprint for long distance gas highways leading to a national gas grid. this would facilitate transportation of gas across the length and breadth of the country.assam gas cracker projectthe assam gas cracker project sanctioned in april 2006 is being executed at a cost of rs.5,461 crore. the capital subsidy of rs.2,138 crore for the project is to be provided by the central government. the outlay for this project is being stepped up suitably.agricultural developmenti now turn to agricultural development.agriculture has been the mainstay of our economy with 60 per cent of our population deriving their sustenance from it. in the recent past, the sector has recorded a growth of about 4 per cent per annum with substantial increase in plan allocations and capital formation in the sector. agriculture credit flow was rs.2,87,000 crore in 2008-09. the target for agriculture credit flow for the year 2009-10 is being set at rs.3,25,000 crore. to achieve this, i propose to continue the interest subvention scheme for short term crop loans to farmers for loans upto rs.3 lakh per farmer at the interest rate of 7 per cent per annum. i am also happy to announce that, for this year, the government shall pay an additional subvention of 1 per cent as an incentive to those farmers who repay their short term crop loans on schedule. thus, the interest rate for these farmers will come down to 6 per cent per annum. for this, i am making an additional budget provision of rs.411 crore over interim be.debt relief for farmersthe one-time bank loan waiver of nearly rs.71,000 crore to cover an estimated 40 million farmers was one of the major highlights of the last budget. under the agricultural debt waiver and debt relief scheme (2008), farmers having more than two hectares of land were given time upto 30th june, 2009 to pay 75% of their overdues. due to the late arrival of monsoon, i propose to extend this period by six months upto 31st december, 2009 .it is learnt that in some regions of maharashtra , a large number of farmers had taken loans from private money lenders and the loan waiver scheme did not cover them. the matter requires special attention. to examine the matter in greater detail and suggest the future course of action, i propose to set up a taskforce.accelerated irrigation benefit programmei propose to provide an additional rs.1,000 crore over interim be for the accelerated irrigation benefit programme (aibp), marking an increase of 75 per cent over the allocation in 2008-09(be). the allocation for the rashtriya krishi vikas yojna (rkvy) is also being stepped up by 30 per cent over budget estimates of 2008-09.restoring export growthour exporters by virtue of their close links to the external sector have borne the brunt of the global economic crisis. it is, therefore, appropriate that we continue to provide all possible assistance to our exporters to help them overcome the short term disadvantages. more specifically:(a) an adjustment assistance scheme to provide enhanced export credit and guarantee corporation (ecgc) cover at 95 per cent to badly hit sectors had been initiated in december 2008 to mitigate the difficulties faced by the exporters. in view of the continuing contraction in exports, i propose to extend the benefits of this scheme up to march 2010.(b) the market development assistance scheme provides support to exporters in developing new markets. with many traditional markets still under financial stress, greater effort is required to identify and develop new markets. i propose to enhance the allocation for this scheme by 148% over be 2008-09 to rs.124 crore.(c) with a view to insulating the employment - oriented export sectors from the global meltdown, government had provided an interest subvention of 2 per cent on pre-shipment credit for seven such sectors. these sectors are textiles including handlooms, handicrafts, carpets, leather, gems and jewellery, marine products and small and medium exporters. i propose to extend the interest subvention beyond the current deadline of september 30, 2009 to march 31, 2010 .(d) micro, small and medium enterprises (msmes) have been affected by the slowdown in exports and the indirect effect of the global crisis on domestic demand. to support this sector, i propose to facilitate the flow of credit at reasonable rates, by providing a special fund out of rural infrastructure development fund (ridf) to small industries development bank (sidbi). this fund of rs.4,000 crore will incentivise banks and state finance corporations (sfcs) to lend to micro and small enterprises (mses) by refinancing 50 per cent of incremental lending to mses during the current financial year.(e) in february, 2009 the print media was given a stimulus package comprising waiver of 15% agency commission on davp advertisements and a 10% increase in the davp rates to be paid as a 'special relief' subject to documentary proof of loss of revenue in non-governmental advertisements. since print media is still passing through difficult times, i have decided to extend the stimulus package for another six months from 30th june, 2009 to 31st december, 2009 .medium-term sustainabilitythe short term fiscal stimulus has to be balanced against long term prudence and fiscal sustainability objectives. to quote kautilya, ""in the interest of the prosperity of the country, a king shall be diligent in foreseeing the possibility of calamities, try to avert them before they arise, overcome those which happen, remove all obstructions to economic activity and prevent loss of revenue to the state"". i intend to take kautilya's advice and return to the frbm target for fiscal deficit at the earliest and as soon as the negative effects of the global crisis on the indian economy have been overcome. on the medium term fiscal perspective, i await the recommendations of the 13th finance commission.to bring the fiscal deficit under control, we have to initiate institutional reform measures during the current year itself. this is essential for maintaining a stable balance of payments, moderate interest rates and steady flow of external capital for corporate investment. these measures have to encompass all aspects of the budget such as subsidies, taxes, expenditure and disinvestment.fertilizer subsidyin the context of the nation's food security, the declining response of agricultural productivity to increased fertilizer usage in the country is a matter of concern. to ensure balanced application of fertilizers, the government intends to move towards a nutrient based subsidy regime instead of the current product pricing regime. it will lead to availability of innovative fertilizer products in the market at reasonable prices. this unshackling of the fertilizer manufacturing sector is expected to attract fresh investments in this sector. in due course it is also intended to move to a system of direct transfer of subsidy to the farmers.petroleum and diesel pricing policymadam speaker, honourable members are aware that global prices of oil and petroleum products had shot up to unprecedented levels in 2008-09. most oil importing countries, including our neighbours, adjusted their domestic prices to reflect these global changes. though prices have declined since then, they are already about double of the lows reached in the wake of the global financial crisis. it is important to recognise that, with almost three-quarters of our oil consumption met through imports, domestic prices of petrol and diesel have to be broadly in sync with global prices of these items. government will set up an expert group to advise on a viable and sustainable system of pricing petroleum products. details will be announced by my colleague, the minister of petroleum and natural gas.taxationit is time that we complete the process that was started in 1991 for building a trust based, simple, neutral, tax system with almost no exemptions and low rates designed to promote voluntary compliance. the income tax return forms should be simple and user-friendly. i have asked the department to work on saral-ii forms for early introduction. we need a tax system which generates revenues on a sustained basis without use of coercive tax collection methods at the end of each year to meet targets. it is my intention to make a modest start in this direction in the current year and ensure that the process is completed in the next four years. at the end of this process, i hope the finance minister can credibly say that our tax collectors are like honey bees collecting nectar from the flowers without disturbing them, but spreading their pollen so that all flowers can thrive and bear fruit.people's ownership of psusthe public sector undertakings are the wealth of the nation, and part of this wealth should rest in the hands of the people. while retaining at least 51 per cent government equity in our enterprises, i propose to encourage people's participation in our disinvestment programme. here, i must state clearly that public sector enterprises such as banks and insurance companies will remain in the public sector and will be given all support, including capital infusion, to grow and remain competitive.financial sectorthe financial sector is the life blood of any economy. our government's approach to the banking and financial sector has been to ensure robust oversight and regulation while expanding financial access and deepening markets. the merit of this balanced approach has been borne out in the recent experience, as the turbulence in the world financial markets has left the indian banking and financial sector relatively unaffected. never before has indira gandhi's bold decision to nationalise our banking system exactly 40 years ago - on 14th of july, 1969 - appeared as wise and visionary as it has over the past few months. her approach continues to be our inspiration even as we introduce competition and new technology in this sector.the average public float in indian listed companies is less than 15 per cent. deep non-manipulable markets require larger and diversified public shareholdings. this requirement should be uniformly applied to the private sector as well as listed public sector companies. i propose to raise, in a phased manner, the threshold for non-promoter public shareholding for all listed companies.for a country like ours, with significant sections of unbanked population and regions, financial inclusion is vital for sustaining long term equitable development. as part of the financial inclusion drive, scheduled commercial banks have been opening 'no frills' accounts either with 'nil' or very low minimum balances. so far, these banks have opened 3.3 crore such accounts. the rbi has announced a further relaxation in its branch authorisation policy. scheduled commercial banks are now allowed to set up off-site atms without prior approval, subject to reporting.despite the expansion of banking network in the country, there are still some areas that remain under-banked or unbanked. a sub-committee of state level bankers committee ( slb c) will identify such areas and formulate an action plan for providing banking facilities to all these areas in the next 3 years. i propose to set aside rs.100 crore during the current year as one-time grant-in-aid to ensure provision of at least one centre/point of sales (pos) for banking services in each of the unbanked blocks in the country.the government has established competition commission of india, an autonomous regulatory body to promote and sustain competition in markets, protect interests of consumers and to prevent practices having adverse effect on competition. an appellate body headed by a retired judge of the supreme court has also been constituted.the benefits of competition should now come to more sectors and their users and consumers. now is the time for us to work on these aspects to eliminate supply bottlenecks, enhance productivity, reduce costs and improve quality of goods and services supplied to consumers.investment environmentprivate sector investment has been affected by the global macro economic conditions. our government is committed to creating a facilitating environment in which a competitive private sector can thrive and play its rightful role in nation's economic development. india 's high growth of 8.5% per annum from 2004 to 2008 was fuelled in very large part by private investment. i look forward to working closely with industry and our vibrant entrepreneurial community to address their outstanding concerns.towards inclusive developmentmadam speaker, the upa government has gone for a paradigm shift for making the development process more inclusive. it involves creating entitlements backed by legal guarantee to provide basic amenities and opportunities for livelihood to vulnerable sections. 'aam admi' is now the focus of all our programmes and schemes.national rural employment guarantee scheme (nregs)46. (i) it is widely acknowledged that the national rural employment guarantee act, (nrega) first implemented in february 2006, has been a magnificent success. during 2008-09, nrega provided employment opportunities for more than 4.47 crore households as against 3.39 crore households covered in 2007-08. we are committed to providing a real wage of rs.100 a day as an entitlement under the nrega. to increase the productivity of assets and resources under nrega, convergence with other schemes relating to agriculture, forests, water resources, land resources and rural roads is being initiated. in the first stage, a total of 115 pilot districts have been selected for such convergence. details of these measures and convergence guidelines will be announced by my colleague, the minister of rural development. i propose an allocation of rs.39,100 crore for the year 2009-10 for nrega which marks an increase of 144% over 2008-09 budget estimates.national food security act (nfsa)(ii) i am happy to announce that the work on national food security act has begun in right earnest. this will ensure that every family living below the poverty line in rural or urban areas will be entitled by law to 25 kilos of rice or wheat per month at rs.3 a kilo. the government proposes to put the draft food security bill on the website of the department of food and public distribution for public debate and consultations very soon.bharat nirman(iii) bharat nirman with its six schemes is an important initiative for bridging the gap between the rural and urban areas and improving the quality of life of people, particularly the poor, in the rural areas. i propose to step up the allocations for bharat nirman by 45 per cent in 2009-10 over the be of 2008-09. the pradhan mantri gram sadak yojana (pmgsy) is one of the most successful programmes under bharat nirman. i propose to step up the allocation for this programme by 59% over be 2008-09 to rs.12,000 crore. i also propose to allocate rs.7,000 crore to rajiv gandhi grameen viduytikaran yojana (rggvy) which represents a 27 per cent increase over 2008-09 (be).(iv) the allocation for the indira awaas yojana ( iay) is proposed to be increased by 63 per cent to rs.8,800 crore in budget estimates 2009-10. to broaden the pace of rural housing, i propose to allocate, from the shortfall in the priority sector lending of commercial banks, a sum of rs.2,000 crore for rural housing fund in the national housing bank (nhb). this will boost the resource base of nhb for their refinance operations in rural housing sector.pradhan mantri adarsh gram yojana (pmagy)(v) there are about 44,000 villages in which the population of scheduled castes is above 50 per cent. a new scheme called pradhan mantri adarsh gram yojana (pmagy) is being launched this year on a pilot basis, for the integrated development of 1000 such villages. i propose an allocation of rs.100 crore for this scheme. each village would be able to avail gap funding of rs.10 lakh over and above the allocations under rural development and poverty alleviation schemes. on successful implementation of the pilot phase, the yojana would be extended in coming years.empowerment of weaker sectionsthe swarna jayanti gram swarozgar yojna (sgsy) is being restructured as the national rural livelihood mission to make it universal in application, focused in approach and time bound for poverty eradication by 2014-15. stress will be laid on the formation of women self help groups (shgs). apart from providing capital subsidy at an enhanced rate, it is also proposed to provide interest subsidy to poor households for loans upto rs. one lakh from banks.the women's self help group movement is bringing about a profound transformation in rural areas. there are today over 22 lakh such groups linked with banks. our objective is to enrol at least 50% of all rural women in india as members of shgs over the next five years and link these shgs to banks.the rashtriya mahila kosh has been working towards the facilitation of credit support or micro finance to poor women and has developed a number of innovative schemes for their benefit. in recognition of its role as an instrument of socio-economic change and development, the corpus of the kosh, which at present is rs.100 crore, would be raised to rs.500 crore, over the next few years.female literacythe low level of female literacy continues to be a matter of grave concern. it has, therefore, been decided to launch a national mission for female literacy, with focus on minorities, sc, st and other marginalised groups. the aim will be to reduce by half, the current level of female illiteracy, in three years.integrated child development servicesgovernment is committed to universalisation of the integrated child development services (icds) scheme in the country. by march 2012, all services under icds would be extended, with quality, to every child under the age of six.student loans to weaker sectionsto enable students from economically weaker sections to access higher education, it is proposed to introduce a scheme to provide them full interest subsidy during the period of moratorium. it will cover loans taken by such students from scheduled banks to pursue any of the approved courses of study, in technical and professional streams, from recognised institutions in india . it is estimated that over 5 lakh students would avail of this benefit.welfare of minoritiesthe plan outlay of ministry of minority affairs has been enhanced from rs.1,000 crore in be 2008-09 to rs.1,740 crore in 2009-10, registering an increase of 74%. this includes rs.990 crore for multi-sectoral development programme for minorities in selected minority concentration districts, grants-in-aid to maulana azad education foundation which is almost doubled, and provisions for national minorities development and finance corporation and pre-matric and post-matric scholarships for minorities. allocations have also been made for the new schemes of national fellowship for students from the minority community and grants-in-aid to central wakf council for computerization of records of state wakf boards.aligarh muslim university has decided to establish its campuses at murshidabad in west bengal and malappuram in kerala. i propose to make an allocation of rs.25 crore each for these two campuses.welfare of workers in the unorganised sectorthe unorganised or informal sector of our economy accounts for 92% of the employment and absorbs bulk of the annual increase in our labour force. the unorganised workers social security bill, 2007 has now been passed by both houses of parliament. i have already initiated action to ensure that social security schemes for occupations like weavers, fishermen and women, toddy tappers, leather and handicraft workers, plantation labour, construction labour, mine workers, bidi workers, and rikshaw pullers are implemented at the earliest. necessary financial allocations will be made for these schemes.employment exchangesi propose to launch a new project for modernisation of the employment exchanges in public private partnership so that a job seeker can register on-line from anywhere and approach any employment exchange. under the project, a national web portal with common software will be developed. this will contain all the data regarding availability of skilled persons on the one hand and requirements of skilled persons by the industry on the other. it will help youth get placed and enable industry to procure required skills on real time basis.handloomsin the last budget two mega handloom clusters at varanasi and sibsagar and two mega powerloom clusters at erode and bhiwandi were approved. they are under successful implementation. i propose to add one handloom mega cluster each in west bengal and tamil nadu and one powerloom mega cluster in rajasthan. these will help preserve the magnificent textile traditions in west bengal and tamil nadu and generate thousands of jobs in rajasthan. in addition, i propose to add new mega clusters for carpets in srinagar (j&k) and mirzapur (up).healththe national rural health mission is an essential instrument for achieving our goal of health for all. i propose an increase of rs.2,057 crore over and above rs.12,070 crore provided in the interim budget.rashtriya swasthya bima yojana (rsby) was operationalised last year. the initial response has been very good. more than 46 lakh bpl families in eighteen states and uts have been issued biometric smart cards. this scheme empowers poor families by giving them freedom of choice for using health care services from an extensive list of hospitals including private hospitals. government proposes to bring all bpl families under this scheme. an amount of rs.350 crore, marking 40% increase over the previous allocation, is being provided in 2009-10 budget estimates.environment and climate changethe national action plan on climate change unveiled last year, outlines our strategy to adapt to climate change and enhance the ecological sustainability of our development path. following this, eight national missions representing a multi-pronged, long term and integrated approach are being launched. i propose to provide necessary funds for these missions.our government has already set up a 'national ganga river basin authority' (ngrba). i propose increasing the budgetary outlay for the national river and lake conservation plans to rs.562 crore in 2009-10 from rs.335 crore in 2008-09.i propose to make a special one-time grant of rs.100 crore to the indian council of forestry research and education, dehradun in recognition of its excellence in the field of research, education and extension. i also propose an allocation of rs.15 crore each for the botanical survey of india and zoological survey of india. an additional amount of rs.15 crore is being allocated to geological survey of india.towards building accountable institutionsimproving delivery of public servicesas substantial resources, both public and private, are mobilized to fuel the growth of the economy and make it more inclusive in character, efficiency of delivery must become the focus of government programmes. the enactment of the right to information act at the centre and in many states has been an important and successful step in this direction, ushering in greater transparency and accountability in the public decision-making process.the setting up of the unique identification authority of india (uidai) is a major step in improving governance with regard to delivery of public services. this project is very close to my heart. i am happy to note that this project also marks the beginning of an era where the top private sector talent in india steps forward to take the responsibility for implementing projects of vital national importance. the uidai will set up an online data base with identity and biometric details of indian residents and provide enrolment and verification services across the country. the first set of unique identity numbers will be rolled out in 12 to 18 months. i have proposed a provision of rs.120 crore for this project.national securityfor modernisation of police force in the states, an additional amount of rs.430 crore is being proposed, over and above the provisions in the interim budget. the government has also sanctioned special risk/hardship allowances to the personnel of para military forces at par with defence forces. provisions for payment of these allowances are also being proposed in the budget.for strengthening border management, an additional amount of rs.2,284 crore, over and above the provision in the interim budget, is being provided for construction of fences, roads, flood-lights on the international borders.significant augmentation in the strength of para-military forces is being done. this calls for more investment in creating the necessary infrastructure, particularly in the area of housing. the government, therefore, proposes to launch a massive programme of housing to create 1 lakh dwelling units for central para-military forces personnel. this will not only contribute to the morale of the forces, but will also enable leveraging of government's annual budgetary resources and create an innovative financing model.one rank one pension for ex-servicemen (orop)our country owes a deep debt of gratitude to our valiant ex-servicemen. the committee headed by the cabinet secretary on orop has submitted its report and the recommendations of the committee have been accepted. on the basis of these recommendations, the government has decided to substantially improve the pension of pre 1.1.2006 defence pensioners below officer rank (pbor) and bring pre 10.10.1997 pensioners on par with post 10.10.1997 pensioners. both these decisions will be implemented from 1st july 2009 resulting in enhanced pension for more than 12 lakh jawans and jcos. these measures will cost the exchequer more than rs.2,100 crore annually. certain pension benefits being extended to war wounded and other disabled pensioners are also being liberalised.educationthe demographic advantage india has in terms of a large percentage of young population needs to be converted into a dynamic economic advantage by providing them the right education and skills. the provision for the scheme, ' mission in education through ict,' has been substantially increased to rs.900 crore. similarly, the provision for setting up and up-gradation of polytechnics under the skill development mission has been increased to rs.495 crore. the government shall take forward its intent of having one central university in each uncovered state and for this purpose i am allocating rs.827 crore. i am also allocating rs.2,113 crore for iits and nits, which includes a provision of rs.450 crore for new iits and nits. the overall plan budget for higher education is proposed to be increased by rs.2,000 crore over interim be.union territory of chandigarh is the capital of punjab and haryana. the facilities at punjab university , chandigarh , need to be improved. i, therefore, propose to make an allocation of rs.50 crore for this university. to enable the union territory administration to provide better infrastructure to the people, i propose to suitably enhance the plan allocation for chandigarh during the current financial year.commonwealth games 2010the commonwealth games present the country with an opportunity to showcase our potential as an emerging asian power. i propose to substantially enhance the allocations for the commonwealth games from rs.2,112 crore in the interim budget to rs.3,472 crore in the budget for 2009-10.madam speaker, the government is committed to ensure that sri lankan tamils enjoy their rights and legitimate aspirations within the territorial sovereignty and framework of sri lanka 's constitution. the ministry of external affairs is working closely with the sri lankan government in this regard. i propose to allocate rs. 500 crore for the rehabilitation of the internally displaced persons and reconstruction of the northern and eastern areas of sri lanka.as honourable members are aware, cyclone aila struck the coast of west bengal in the last week of may 2009. extensive damage was caused to roads, houses and infrastructure. while immediate interim relief has been provided from the calamity relief fund (crf), it is proposed to draw up a programme for rebuilding the damaged infrastructure. for this purpose, i propose to allocate rs.1,000 crore.budget estimates 2009-10madam speaker, now i turn to the budget estimates for 2009-10.the budget estimates 2009-10 provide for a total expenditure of rs.10,20,838 crore consisting of rs.6,95,689 crore towards non plan and rs.3,25,149 crore towards plan expenditure. the increase in non plan expenditure over be 2008-09 is 37% whereas the increase in plan expenditure is 34%. the total increase in expenditure in 2009-10 over be 2008-09 is 36%.the increase in non plan expenditure is mainly on account of the implementation of the sixth central pay commission recommendations, increased food subsidy and higher interest payment arising out of the larger fiscal deficit in 2008-09. interest payments are estimated at rs.2,25,511 crore constituting about 36% of non plan revenue expenditure in be 2009-10. the total provision for subsidies are up from rs.71,431 crore in be 2008-09 to rs.1,11,276 crore in be 2009-10. the outlay on defence has gone up from rs.1,05,600 crore in be 2008-09 to rs.1,41,703 crore in be 2009-10.honourable members may recall that while presenting the interim budget 2009-10, i had stated that the plan expenditure for 2009-10 may have to be increased further as a part of counter-cyclical measures to minimise the impact of global recession and economic slowdown. against the backdrop of limited fiscal space because of reduction in cenvat and service tax rates, government have taken a conscious and bold decision to enhance the gross budgetary support (gbs) for the annual plan 2009-10 by rs.40,000 crore over interim budget 2009-10. bulk of this enhanced gbs is directed towards public investment in infrastructure with special emphasis on rural infrastructure, raising growth potential and leading to income generation. besides, the state governments will be permitted to borrow additional 0.5% of their gsdp by relaxing the fiscal deficit target under frbm from 3.5% to 4% of their gsdp. this will enable the state governments to raise additional open market loans of about rs.21,000 crore in the current year. in other words, the total additionality in plan expenditure by centre and the states put together would be rs.61,000 crore over interim budget. i do believe that this fiscal expansion will go a long way in reversing the impact of economic slowdown and accelerate our growth revival in the medium term.madam speaker, given the possibility of the economic downturn persisting in the current year, the gross tax receipts are budgeted at rs.6,41,079 crore in be 2009-10, compared to rs.6,87,715 crore in be 2008-09. the non tax revenue receipts are, however, likely to be better and are estimated at rs.1,40,279 crore in be 2009-10 compared to rs.95,785 crore in be 2008-09. the revenue deficit as a percentage of gdp is projected at 4.8% compared to 1% in be 2008-09 and 4.6% as per provisional accounts of 2008-09. the fiscal deficit as a percentage of gdp is projected at 6.8% compared to 2.5% in be 2008-09 and 6.2% as per provisional accounts 2008-09. this level of deficit is a matter of concern and government will address this issue in right earnest to come back to the path of fiscal consolidation at the earliest.madam speaker, before i turn to my tax proposals, i cannot resist the temptation of re-visiting kautilya. he said and i quote, ""just as one plucks fruits from a garden as they ripen, so shall a king have revenue collected as it becomes due. just as one does not collect unripe fruits, he shall avoid taking wealth that is not due because that will make the people angry and spoil the very sources of revenue.""part - btax proposalsmadam speaker, i shall now present my tax proposals.as the house is aware, the thrust of reforms over the last few years, including the previous term of this government, has been to improve the efficiency and equity of our tax system. this is sought to be achieved by eliminating distortions in the tax structure, introducing moderate levels of taxation and expanding the base. these policy changes have been accompanied by requisite re-engineering of key business processes coupled with automation, both for direct and indirect taxes. on the direct tax side, a recent initiative for further improving efficiency is the setting up of a centralized processing centre (cpc) at bengaluru where all electronically filed returns, and paper returns filed in entire karnataka, will be processed.these tax reform initiatives have produced impressive results. the centre's tax- gdp ratio has increased to 11.5 per cent in 2008-09 from a low of 9.2 per cent in 2003-04. the healthy growth in tax revenues over the last five years is essentially attributable to growth in direct taxes. further, the share of direct taxes in the centre's tax revenues has increased to 56 per cent in 2008-09 from 41 per cent in 2003-04, reflecting a sharp improvement in the equity of our tax system. the government is committed to furthering this process of tax reform.in the course of preparation of this budget, i have had the opportunity to interact with large number of stakeholders and receive valuable inputs. most suggestions were for structural changes in the tax system. tax reform, like all reforms, is a process and not an event. therefore, i propose to pursue structural changes in direct taxes by releasing the new direct taxes code within the next 45 days and in indirect taxes by accelerating the process for the smooth introduction of the goods and services tax (gst) with effect from 1st april, 2010 .the direct taxes code, along with a discussion paper, will be released to the public for debate. based on the inputs received, the government will finalise the direct taxes code bill for introduction in this house sometime during the winter session.to further enhance efficiency in tax administration, i intend to merge the two authorities for advance rulings on direct and indirect taxes by amending the relevant acts. this will enable the authority for advance rulings set up under section 245-o of the income tax act, 1961 to also function as the authority for advance rulings for indirect taxes.i have been informed that the empowered committee of state finance ministers has made considerable progress in preparing the roadmap and the design of the gst. officials from the central government have also been associated in this exercise. i am glad to inform the house that, through their collaborative efforts, they have reached an agreement on the basic structure in keeping with the principles of fiscal federalism enshrined in the constitution. i compliment the empowered committee of state finance ministers for their untiring efforts. the broad contour of the gst model is that it will be a dual gst comprising of a central gst and a state gst. the centre and the states will each legislate, levy and administer the central gst and state gst, respectively. i will reinforce the central government's catalytic role to facilitate the introduction of gst by 1st april, 2010 after due consultations with all stakeholders.direct taxesi shall now deal with direct taxes.madam speaker, there have been demands by the corporate sector for reduction in tax rates. however, tax rates are determined by the size of the tax base; if the tax base is higher, the tax rates can be lower. the income tax act is riddled with a plethora of tax exemptions which substantially erode the tax base. the extent of this erosion is presented to this house in the form of a revenue foregone statement. the growth in the direct tax revenue foregone is relatively higher than the growth in the direct tax revenues. accordingly, i do not propose to make any change in the corporate tax rates.with a view to providing interim relief to small and marginal taxpayers and senior citizens, i propose to increase the personal income tax exemption limit by rs.15,000 from rs.2.25 lakh to rs.2.40 lakh for senior citizens. similarly i also propose to raise the exemption limit by rs.10,000 from rs.1.80 lakh to rs.1.90 lakh for women tax payers and by rs.10,000 from rs.1.50 lakh to rs.1.60 lakh for all other categories of individual taxpayers. further, i also propose to increase the deduction under section 80-dd in respect of maintenance, including medical treatment, of a dependent who is a person with severe disability to rs.1 lakh from the present limit of rs.75,000.in the past, surcharges on direct taxes have generally been levied to meet the revenue needs arising from natural calamities. the government has set up the national calamity contingency fund to build up resources to meet emergency situations. as a corollary, surcharge on direct taxes should be removed. however, this has to be balanced with the revenue needs of the government. therefore, in the first instance, i propose to phase out the surcharge on various direct taxes by eliminating the surcharge of 10 per cent on personal income tax.deduction in respect of export profits is available under sections 10a and 10b of the income-tax act. the deduction under these sections would not be available beyond the financial year 2009-2010. in order to tide over the slowdown in exports, i propose to extend the sun-set clauses for these tax holidays by one more year i.e. for the financial year 2010-11.the finance act, 2005 introduced the fringe benefit tax on the value of certain fringe benefits provided by employers to their employees. this tax has been perceived as imposing considerable compliance burden. empathising with these sentiments, i propose to abolish the fringe benefit tax.the competitive ability of an economy rests on its progress in the area of research and development (r&d). in order to incentivise the corporate sector to undertake r&d work, i propose to extend the scope of the current provision of weighted deduction of 150% on expenditure incurred on in-house r&d to all manufacturing businesses except for a small negative list.under the present scheme of the income tax act, tax exemptions are largely profit-linked. such incentives are inherently inefficient and liable to misuse. therefore, it is proposed to incentivise businesses by providing investment-linked tax exemptions. to begin with, i propose to extend investment- linked tax incentives to the businesses of setting up and operating 'cold chain', warehousing facilities for storing agricultural produce and the business of laying and operating cross country natural gas or crude or petroleum oil pipeline network for distribution on common carrier principle. under this method, all capital expenditure, other than expenditure on land, goodwill and financial instruments will be fully allowable as deduction.minimum alternate tax (mat) was introduced to address inequity in taxation of corporate taxpayers. in the quest for greater equity, i propose to increase the rate of mat to 15 per cent of book profits from the present rate of 10 per cent. however, to grant relief to corporate taxpayers, i also propose to extend the period allowed to carry forward the tax credit under mat from seven years to ten years.the new pension system (nps) is an important milestone in the development of a sustainable, efficient, voluntary and defined contribution pension system in india . while the nps will continue to be subjected to the exempt-exempt-taxed (eet) method of tax treatment of savings, it is proposed to provide necessary fiscal support to the nps for the establishment of this much needed social security system. accordingly, i propose to exempt the income of the nps trust from income tax and any dividend paid to this trust from dividend distribution tax. similarly, all purchase and sale of equity shares and derivatives by the nps trust will also be exempt from the securities transaction tax. i also propose to enable self employed persons to participate in the nps and avail of the tax benefits available thereto.in order to further improve the investment climate in the country, we need to facilitate the resolution of tax disputes faced by foreign companies within a reasonable time frame. this is particularly relevant for such companies in the information technology (it) sector. i, therefore, propose to create an alternative dispute resolution mechanism within the income tax department for the resolution of transfer pricing disputes. to reduce the impact of judgemental errors in determining transfer price in international transactions, it is proposed to empower the central board of direct taxes (cbdt) to formulate 'safe harbour' rules.the finance act, 2008 introduced the commodity transaction tax (ctt) to be levied on taxable commodities transactions entered in a recognized association. the prime minister's economic advisory council has recommended abolition of the ctt. i, therefore, propose to abolish the commodity transaction tax.the house will agree that it is desirable to bring about transparency in the funding of political parties in the country. with a view to reforming the system of funding of political parties, i propose to provide that donations to electoral trusts shall be allowed as a 100 per cent deduction in the computation of the income of the donor. for this purpose, electoral trusts will be such trusts as are set up as pass-through vehicles for routing the donations to political parties and are approved by cbdt.section 80e of the income-tax act provides for a deduction in respect of interest on loans taken for pursuing higher education in specified fields of study. i propose to extend the scope of this provision to cover all fields of study, including vocational studies, pursued after completion of schooling.anonymous donations to charitable institutions are presently liable to tax so as to prevent unaccounted money being routed to such entities in the garb of anonymous donations. however, some organisations are facing genuine problems in complying with the procedural requirements. in order to mitigate the practical difficulties being faced by such charitable organisations, i propose to grant relief to such organisations by not taxing anonymous donations received to the extent of 5 per cent of their total income or a sum of rs.1 lakh, whichever is higher.to facilitate the business operations of all small taxpayers and reduce their compliance burden, i propose to expand the scope of presumptive taxation to all small businesses with a turnover upto rs.40 lakh. all such taxpayers will have the option to declare their income from business at the rate of 8 per cent of their turnover and simultaneously enjoy exemption from the compliance burden of maintaining books of accounts. as a procedural simplification, i also propose to allow them to pay their entire tax liability from business at the time of filing their return by exempting them from paying advance tax. this new scheme will come into effect from the financial year 2010-11.madam speaker, in the context of the geo-political environment, it is necessary for us to create our own facilities for energy security. accordingly, i propose to extend the tax holiday under section 80-ib(9) of the income tax act, which was hitherto available in respect of profits arising from the commercial production or refining of mineral oil, also to natural gas. this tax benefit will be available to undertakings in respect of profits derived from the commercial production of mineral oil and natural gas from oil and gas blocks which are awarded under the new exploration licensing policy-viii round of bidding. further, i also propose to retrospectively amend the provisions of the said section to provide that ""undertaking"" for the purposes of section 80-ib(9) will mean all blocks awarded in any single contract.under the present provisions of section 2 (15) of the income tax act, ""charitable purpose"" includes relief of the poor, education, medical relief, and the ""advancement of any other object of general public utility"". however, the ""advancement of any other object of general public utility"" cannot involve the carrying on of any activity in the nature of trade, commerce or business. i propose to provide the same tax treatment to trusts engaged in preserving and improving our environment (including watersheds, forests and wildlife) and preserving our monuments or places or objects of artistic or historic interest, as is available to trusts engaged in providing relief of the poor, education and medical relief.indirect taxesmadam speaker, i turn to my main proposals on indirect taxes.i will first take up customs duties.although our domestic industry has weathered the impact of the global financial crisis and the resultant slowdown with resilience, it is yet to fully find its feet. manufacturing growth, which had turned negative in october 2008 on a year-on-year basis and remained in that zone till march this year, appears to be barely turning the corner. however, the global scenario remains worrisome and it is my view that the paramount need is to provide industry with a stable framework. my proposals on indirect taxes seek to achieve this by maintaining the overall rate structure for customs and central excise duties as well as service tax. i must hasten to add that i have not hesitated to act where distortions provide a compelling reason or where relief would provide a healing touch.full exemption from basic customs duty was provided to set top boxes in 2006 to enable their free import for the smooth introduction of the conditional access system (cas). now that production capacity has come up in the country, i propose to impose a nominal basic customs duty of 5 per cent on such set top boxes to encourage domestic value addition.the electronic hardware industry has a strong potential for creating employment especially in the sme sector. i intend to reduce the basic customs duty on lcd panels from 10 per cent to 5 per cent to support indigenous production of lcd televisions.full exemption from cvd of 4 per cent was available to accessories, parts and components imported for the manufacture of mobile phones till the 30th of june, 2009 . i propose to reintroduce this exemption for another year.for reasons that are apparent, industry sectors having an export-orientation have been adversely impacted by the demand compression in global markets. presently, exporters of leather products, textile garments, footwear as well as sports goods are permitted to import raw materials, consumables etc. upto 3 per cent of the fob value of their exports free of duty. i propose to add a few more items to these lists. full exemption from basic customs duty is being provided to rough corals for encouraging value-addition and export.it is imperative that the contribution of new and renewable energy sources of power is enhanced if we have to successfully combat the phenomena of global warming and climate change. i am reducing the basic customs duty on permanent magnets - a critical component for wind operated electricity generators - from 7.5 per cent to 5 per cent.on influenza vaccine and nine specified life saving drugs used for the treatment of breast cancer, hepatitis-b, rheumatic arthritis etc. and on bulk drugs used for the manufacture of such drugs, i propose to reduce the customs duty from 10 per cent to 5 per cent. they will also be totally exempt from excise duty and countervailing duty.customs duty will also be reduced from 7.5 per cent to 5 per cent on two specified life saving devices used in treatment of heart conditions. these devices will be fully exempt from excise duty and cvd also.gold bars currently attract customs duty at the specific rate of rs.100 per ten grams while other forms of gold (excluding jewellery) are chargeable to a duty of rs.250 per ten grams. these rates were fixed in 2004 and have not been reviewed even as the price of gold has increased manifold. i propose to partially restore the incidence by increasing these rates to rs.200 per ten grams and rs.500 per ten grams respectively. along the same lines, the customs duty on silver (excluding jewellery) will be increased from rs.500 per kg to rs.1,000 per kg. these revised rates would also apply to gold and silver, including ornaments that are not studded, when imported by a bona fide passenger as baggage.i will now come to central excise duties.hon'ble members are aware that the government announced a series of fiscal stimulus packages, one of the key elements of which was the sharp reduction in the ad valorem rates of central excise duty for non-petroleum products by 4 percentage points across the board on 7th of december 2008 and by another 2 percentage points in the mean cenvat rate on the 24th of february, 2009.one of the consequences of these cuts was that pure cotton textiles came to be fully exempted from excise duty. we have received representations that full exemption prevents manufacturers from availing of export rebate of the duty paid from cenvat credit. i propose to rectify this situation by restoring the erstwhile optional rate of 4 per cent for cotton textiles beyond the fibre stage.ever since the revamp of the excise duty structure on textiles by my distinguished predecessor in the 2004 budget, a differential in rates has been maintained between the cotton sector and the manmade sector. in keeping with the integrity of the earlier structure, i propose to restore the rate of 8 per cent central excise duty on manmade fibre and yarn on a mandatory basis and on stages beyond fibre and yarn at that rate on optional basis. these changes, together with duty changes on intermediates, would imply that the duty on all types of manmade fibre and yarn and their intermediates would be the same, easing the problem of credit accumulation.wool waste and cotton waste are chargeable to basic customs duty of 15 per cent. these are used in the manufacture of cheaper varieties of textile articles such as blankets and rugs. as a measure of relief to this sector, i propose to reduce the basic customs duty on these items to 10 per cent.with the government's proclaimed objective of introducing a goods and services tax (gst) both at the national and state level, some more steps in that direction are necessary. one measure that would facilitate the process is the further convergence of central excise duty rates to a mean rate - currently 8 per cent. i have reviewed the list of items currently attracting the rate of 4 per cent, the only rate below the mean rate. there is a case for enhancing the rate on many items appearing in this list to 8 per cent, which i propose to do, with the following major exceptions:a. food items; andb. drugs, pharmaceuticals and medical equipment.c. some of the other items on which i propose to retain the rate of 4 per cent are:d. paper, paperboard & their articles;e. items of mass consumption such as pressure cookers, cheaper electric bulbs, low-priced footwear, water filters/purifiers, cfl etc.;f. power driven pumps for handling water; andg. paraxylene.the details are available in the relevant notifications.bio-diesel, obtained from vegetable oils and used for blending with petro-diesel, is currently exempt from excise duty. i now propose to fully exempt petro-diesel blended with bio-diesel from excise duty.in order to encourage the use of this environment friendly fuel and augment its availability in the country, i also propose to reduce basic customs duty on bio-diesel from 7.5 per cent to 2.5 per cent - at par with petro-diesel. with these proposals i hope to see a smile on the faces of the green brigade!my other proposals on central excise duties seek to address distortions that the manufacturing industry has been complaining about.the it industry has pointed out that it is facing difficulties in the assessment of software which involves transfer of the right to use after the levy of service tax on it software service. to resolve the matter, i propose to exempt the value attributable to the transfer of the right to use packaged software from excise duty and cvd.the construction industry has represented that they are facing difficulties on account of withdrawal of exemption on goods manufactured at site. i propose to restore full exemption to such goods, including pre-fabricated concrete slabs or blocks, when used for further construction at site.a specific component was added to the ad valorem duty of 24 per cent applicable to large cars and utility vehicles in june last year. in the case of vehicles of engine capacity below 2000 cc, this component was rs.15,000/- per unit while for vehicles of higher engine capacity it was rs.20,000/- per unit. these rates are now being unified at the lower level of rs.15,000/- per unit.petrol driven trucks provide a useful means of transport within cities and across short distances. these are chargeable to excise duty of 20 per cent. i propose to reduce excise duty on these trucks to 8 per cent to equate the duty with similar vehicles run on diesel.madam speaker, i fear that my proposals relating to gold and silver on the customs side would somewhat dent my popularity with women. i propose to salvage this by fully exempting branded jewellery from excise duty.i now turn to my proposals on service tax.it is an international practice to zero-rate exports. to achieve this objective, a scheme was announced in 2007, granting refund of service tax paid on certain taxable services used after the clearance of export goods from the factory. for some time now, the exporting community has been expressing dissatisfaction over the difficulties faced in obtaining such refunds. several procedural simplifications attempted in the past have also not yielded satisfactory results. the solution seems to lie in placing greater trust on the claims filed by the exporters. keeping this in view, i propose to make the following changes in the scheme:a. services received by exporters from goods transport agents and commission agents, where the liability to pay service tax is ab initio on the exporter, would be exempted from service tax. thus, there would be no need for the exporter to first pay the tax and later claim refund.b. for other services received by exporters, the exemption would be operated through the existing refund mechanism based on self-certification of the documents where such refund is below 0.25 per cent of fob value, and certification of documents by a chartered accountant for value of refund exceeding the above limit.c. the export promotion councils and the federation of indian export organizations (fieo) provide a valuable service in augmenting our export effort. i propose to exempt them from the levy of service tax on the membership and other fees collected by them till 31st march, 2010 .in the goods transport sector, service tax is currently levied on transport of goods by road, by air, through pipelines and in containers. however, goods carried by indian railways or those carried as coastal cargo or through inland waterways are not charged to service tax. in order to provide a level playing field in the goods transport sector, i propose to extend the levy of service tax to these modes of goods transport. the new levy is not likely to impact the prices of essential commodities or goods for mass consumption, as suitable exemptions would be provided.as the hon'ble members are aware, services provided by chartered accountants, cost accountants, and company secretaries as well as by engineering and management consultants are presently charged to service tax. although there is a school of thought that legal consultants do not provide any service to their client, i hold my distinguished predecessor in high esteem and disagree! as such, i propose to extend service tax on advice, consultancy or technical assistance provided in the field of law. this tax would not be applicable in case the service provider or the service receiver is an individual.vehicles having 'stage carriage permits' and run by state undertakings are exempted from service tax. however, transportation of passengers undertaken by private enterprises in vehicles having 'contract carriage permits' is, subjected to service tax. in order to bring parity in tax treatment, i propose to exempt such transportation also from the levy of service tax.in july, 2008 goods transport agents (gta) went on strike with several demands. one of the demands that was accepted by the government was to exempt certain services, such as packing, cargo handling and warehousing, provided to gtas en route, from service tax. for this purpose an exemption notification was issued. it was also demanded by goods transport agents that the proceedings already initiated against such service providers should be dropped. the government has accepted this genuine demand. therefore, i propose to make certain legislative changes required to fulfill this promise.copies of notifications giving effect to the changes in customs, central excise and service tax will be laid on the table of the house in due course.my tax proposals on direct taxes are revenue neutral. on indirect taxes, they are estimated to yield a net gain of rs.2,000 crore for a full year.conclusionas we begin this five year journey, the road ahead will not be easy. we will have to manage uncertainties and there will be as many problems as there would be solutions. mahatma gandhi said and i quote, ""democracy is the art and science of mobilizing the entire physical, economic and spiritual resources of various sections of the people in the service of the common good of all."" this is precisely what we will have to do. with strong hearts, enlightened minds and willing hands, we will have to overcome all odds and remove all obstacles to create a brave new india of our dreams.madam speaker, with these words i commend the budget to the house.",0.07405572471062219,full

2009-07-06,full text of pranab's budget speech," here's the full text of the speech by finance minister pranab mukherjee in parliament on monday.madam speaker,i rise to present the budget for 2009-10.just 140 days back, i had the privilege to present the interim budget for 2009-10. it is a rare honour that i have been called upon to present the regular budget after the new government assumed office.the congress-led upa government has come back to power with a renewed mandate. as prime minister, dr. manmohan singh, said recently ""it is a mandate for continuity, stability and prosperity. it is a mandate for inclusive growth and equitable development."" it is a mandate that we accept with humility and a firm resolve to do all that we can for the welfare of this nation.i am deeply conscious of the faith reposed by the people in our government and the responsibilities that come with it. i am sensitive to the great challenge of rising expectations of a young india . it reflects a population that is restless, yet engaged and is ready to seize the opportunities that it is presented with. there are new and powerful reasons for us to create, facilitate and sustain those opportunities.in the interim budget for 2009-10, i had stated that the new government would need to anchor its policies for 2009-10, in a medium term perspective that would have to:(a) sustain a growth rate of at least 9 per cent per annum over an extended period of time;(b) strengthen the mechanisms for inclusive growth for creating about 12 million new work opportunities per year;(c) reduce the proportion of people living below poverty line to less than half from current levels by 2014;(d) ensure that indian agriculture continues to grow at an annual rate of 4 per cent;(e) increase the investment in infrastructure to more than 9 per cent of gdp by 2014;(f) support indian industry to meet the challenge of global competition and sustain the growth momentum in exports;(g) strengthen and improve the economic regulatory framework in the country;(h) expand the range and reach of social safety nets by providing direct assistance to vulnerable sections;(i) strengthen the delivery mechanism for primary health care facilities with a view to improve the preventive and curative health care in the country;(j) create a competitive, progressive and well regulated education system of global standards that meets the aspiration of all segments of the society; and(k) move towards providing energy security by pursuing an integrated energy policy.the government recognizes the challenges that this task entails, particularly at a time when the world is still struggling with an unprecedented financial crisis and an economic slowdown that has also affected india . while we are determined to convert our words into deeds, members would appreciate that a single budget speech cannot solve all our problems, nor is the union budget the only instrument to do so. yet, it is an important means to share the vision of the government, particularly as we begin a new term. i propose to do just that for the next hour or so, as i dwell on the challenges and outline the approach of the government in the short term and medium term perspectives.the first challenge is to lead the economy back to the high gdp growth rate of 9 per cent per annum at the earliest. growth of income is important in itself, but it is as important for the resources that it brings in. these resources provide us with the means to bridge the critical gaps that remain in our development efforts, particularly with regard to the welfare of the vulnerable segments of our population.the second challenge is to deepen and broaden the agenda for inclusive development; and to ensure that no individual, community or region is denied the opportunity to participate in and benefit from the development process.the third challenge is to re-energize government and improve delivery mechanisms. our institutions must provide high quality public services, security and the rule of law to all citizens with transparency and accountability.overview of the economymadam speaker, at the time of the presentation of the interim budget, i had given a detailed analysis of the economic situation. without repeating myself, i would like to highlight that the development course charted by the upa government in the last five years has been possible due to a step up in the growth rate of the economy and improved revenue buoyancy. the principal growth driver in this period has been private investment, which has been predominantly funded by domestic resources. during the year 2008-09, there has been a dip in the growth rate of gdp from an average of over 9 per cent in the previous three fiscal years to 6.7 per cent. it has affected the pace of job creation in certain sectors of the economy and the investment sentiments of the business community. it has also resulted in considerably lower revenue growth for the government. another feature of the year 2008-09 was a sharp rise in the wholesale price index to nearly 13% in august 2008 and an equally sharp fall close to 0% in march 2009. while a detailed analysis of the developments has been presented in the economic survey-2008-09, tabled in both houses of parliament last thursday, i draw your attention to a few aspects.the structure of india 's economy has changed rapidly in the last ten years. external trade and external capital flows are an important part of the economy and so is the contribution of the services sector to the gdp at well over 50 per cent. the share of merchandise trade (exports plus imports) as a proportion of gdp has more than doubled over the past decade to 38.9 per cent in 2008-09. similarly, trade in goods and services taken together has also doubled to 47 per cent during this period. gross capital flows rose to a peak of over 9 per cent of gdp in 2007-08 before falling in the wake of the global financial crisis. the significant increase in the inflow of foreign capital is important, not so much for bridging the domestic savings-investment gap, but for facilitating the intermediation of financial resources to meet the growing needs of the economy.this growing integration of the indian economy with the rest of the world has brought new opportunities and also new challenges. it has made the task of sustaining high growth more complex. over the past month, we have critically evaluated government's efforts at both short term economic recovery as well as medium term economic growth. the economic recovery and growth is a cooperative effort of the central and state governments. that is why, for the first time, i held a meeting with finance ministers of states as part of the preparations for this budget. i intend to make this an annual feature.towards economic revivalshort-term measuresto counter the negative fallout of the global slowdown on the indian economy, the government responded by providing three focused fiscal stimulus packages in the form of tax relief to boost demand and increased expenditure on public projects to create employment and public assets. the rbi took a number of monetary easing and liquidity enhancing measures to facilitate flow of funds from the financial system to meet the needs of productive sectors.this fiscal accommodation led to an increase in fiscal deficit from 2.7 per cent in 2007-08 to 6.2 per cent of gdp in 2008-09. the difference between the actuals of 2007-08 and 2008-09 constituted the total fiscal stimulus. this fiscal stimulus at 3.5% of gdp at current market prices for 2008-09 amounts to rs.1,86,000 crore.these measures were effective in arresting the fall in growth rate of gdp in 2008-09 and we achieved a growth of 6.7 per cent. there are signs of revival in the domestic industry and the foreign investors have also returned to the indian market in the last couple of months. it is possible that the two worst quarters since the global financial meltdown in september 2008 are behind us. while the global financial conditions have shown improvement over the recent months, uncertainties relating to the revival of the global economy remain. we cannot, therefore, afford to drop our guard. we have to continue our efforts to provide further stimulus to the economy.madam speaker, what i unfold now are only the 'first steps'. it will be my endeavour to make the process of budget formulation more participatory and a continuous exercise.infrastructure developmentto stimulate public investment in infrastructure, we had set up the india infrastructure finance company limited (iifcl) as a special purpose vehicle for providing long term financial assistance to infrastructure projects. we will ensure that iifcl is given greater flexibility to aggressively fulfil its mandate.'takeout financing' is an accepted international practice of releasing long term funds for financing infrastructure projects. it can be used to effectively address the asset liability mismatch of commercial banks arising out of financing infrastructure projects and also to free up capital for financing new projects. iifcl would, in consultation with banks, evolve a 'takeout financing' scheme which could facilitate incremental lending to the infrastructure sector.government has had some success in attracting private investment in a wide range of infrastructure sectors such as telecommunications, power generation, airports, ports, roads and even in railways through public private partnerships ( ppp ). to ensure that infrastructure projects do not face financing difficulties arising from the current downturn, as i indicated in my interim budget speech, the government has decided that iifcl will refinance 60 per cent of commercial bank loans for ppp projects in critical sectors over the next fifteen to eighteen months. the iifcl and banks are now in a position to support projects involving a total investment of rs.100 thousand crore in infrastructure. combined with the steps we are taking to increase public investment in infrastructure, this will provide a big boost to such investment.the investment in infrastructure for the growth of economy is critical. i have urged my colleagues in the central and state governments to remove policy, regulatory and institutional bottlenecks for speedy implementation of infrastructure projects. i, on my part, will ensure that sufficient funds are made available for this sector.highway and railwaysthe allocation during the current year to national highways authority of india (nhai) for the national highways development programme (nhdp) is being stepped up by 23 per cent over the 2008-09 (be). i have also increased the allocation for the railways from rs.10,800 crore made in the interim budget for 2009-10 to rs.15,800 crore.urban infrastructurethe jawaharlal nehru national urban renewal mission (jnnurm) has been an important instrument for refocusing the attention of the state governments on the importance of urban infrastructure. in recognition of the role of jnnurm, the allocation for this scheme is being stepped up by 87 per cent to rs.12,887 crore in the current budget. to improve the lot of the urban poor, i propose to enhance the allocation for housing and provision of basic amenities to urban poor to rs.3,973 crore in the current year's budget. this includes the provision for rajiv awas yojana (ray), a new scheme announced in the address of the president of india. this scheme, the parameters of which are being worked out, is intended to make the country slum free in the five year period.brihan mumbai storm water drainage project (brimstowa)to address the problem of flooding in mumbai, brihan mumbai storm water drainage project (brimstowa) was initiated in 2007. the entire estimated cost of the project at rs.1,200 crore is being funded through central assistance. a sum of rs.500 crore has been released for this project upto 2008-09. i have enhanced the provision for this project from rs.200 crore in interim be to rs.500 crore to expedite the completion of the project.powerthe accelerated power development and reform programme (apdrp) is an important scheme for reducing the gap between power demand and supply. i propose to increase the allocation for this scheme to rs.2,080 crore, a steep increase of 160 per cent above the allocation in the be of 2008-09.gaswith the recent find of natural gas in the kg basin on the eastern offshore of the country, the indigenous production of natural gas is set to double with natural gas emerging as an important source of energy. lng infrastructure in the country is also being expanded. government proposes to develop a blueprint for long distance gas highways leading to a national gas grid. this would facilitate transportation of gas across the length and breadth of the country.assam gas cracker projectthe assam gas cracker project sanctioned in april 2006 is being executed at a cost of rs.5,461 crore. the capital subsidy of rs.2,138 crore for the project is to be provided by the central government. the outlay for this project is being stepped up suitably.agricultural developmenti now turn to agricultural development.agriculture has been the mainstay of our economy with 60 per cent of our population deriving their sustenance from it. in the recent past, the sector has recorded a growth of about 4 per cent per annum with substantial increase in plan allocations and capital formation in the sector. agriculture credit flow was rs.2,87,000 crore in 2008-09. the target for agriculture credit flow for the year 2009-10 is being set at rs.3,25,000 crore. to achieve this, i propose to continue the interest subvention scheme for short term crop loans to farmers for loans upto rs.3 lakh per farmer at the interest rate of 7 per cent per annum. i am also happy to announce that, for this year, the government shall pay an additional subvention of 1 per cent as an incentive to those farmers who repay their short term crop loans on schedule. thus, the interest rate for these farmers will come down to 6 per cent per annum. for this, i am making an additional budget provision of rs.411 crore over interim be.debt relief for farmersthe one-time bank loan waiver of nearly rs.71,000 crore to cover an estimated 40 million farmers was one of the major highlights of the last budget. under the agricultural debt waiver and debt relief scheme (2008), farmers having more than two hectares of land were given time upto 30th june, 2009 to pay 75% of their overdues. due to the late arrival of monsoon, i propose to extend this period by six months upto 31st december, 2009 .it is learnt that in some regions of maharashtra , a large number of farmers had taken loans from private money lenders and the loan waiver scheme did not cover them. the matter requires special attention. to examine the matter in greater detail and suggest the future course of action, i propose to set up a taskforce.accelerated irrigation benefit programmei propose to provide an additional rs.1,000 crore over interim be for the accelerated irrigation benefit programme (aibp), marking an increase of 75 per cent over the allocation in 2008-09(be). the allocation for the rashtriya krishi vikas yojna (rkvy) is also being stepped up by 30 per cent over budget estimates of 2008-09.restoring export growthour exporters by virtue of their close links to the external sector have borne the brunt of the global economic crisis. it is, therefore, appropriate that we continue to provide all possible assistance to our exporters to help them overcome the short term disadvantages. more specifically:(a) an adjustment assistance scheme to provide enhanced export credit and guarantee corporation (ecgc) cover at 95 per cent to badly hit sectors had been initiated in december 2008 to mitigate the difficulties faced by the exporters. in view of the continuing contraction in exports, i propose to extend the benefits of this scheme up to march 2010.(b) the market development assistance scheme provides support to exporters in developing new markets. with many traditional markets still under financial stress, greater effort is required to identify and develop new markets. i propose to enhance the allocation for this scheme by 148% over be 2008-09 to rs.124 crore.(c) with a view to insulating the employment - oriented export sectors from the global meltdown, government had provided an interest subvention of 2 per cent on pre-shipment credit for seven such sectors. these sectors are textiles including handlooms, handicrafts, carpets, leather, gems and jewellery, marine products and small and medium exporters. i propose to extend the interest subvention beyond the current deadline of september 30, 2009 to march 31, 2010 .(d) micro, small and medium enterprises (msmes) have been affected by the slowdown in exports and the indirect effect of the global crisis on domestic demand. to support this sector, i propose to facilitate the flow of credit at reasonable rates, by providing a special fund out of rural infrastructure development fund (ridf) to small industries development bank (sidbi). this fund of rs.4,000 crore will incentivise banks and state finance corporations (sfcs) to lend to micro and small enterprises (mses) by refinancing 50 per cent of incremental lending to mses during the current financial year.(e) in february, 2009 the print media was given a stimulus package comprising waiver of 15% agency commission on davp advertisements and a 10% increase in the davp rates to be paid as a 'special relief' subject to documentary proof of loss of revenue in non-governmental advertisements. since print media is still passing through difficult times, i have decided to extend the stimulus package for another six months from 30th june, 2009 to 31st december, 2009 .medium-term sustainabilitythe short term fiscal stimulus has to be balanced against long term prudence and fiscal sustainability objectives. to quote kautilya, ""in the interest of the prosperity of the country, a king shall be diligent in foreseeing the possibility of calamities, try to avert them before they arise, overcome those which happen, remove all obstructions to economic activity and prevent loss of revenue to the state"". i intend to take kautilya's advice and return to the frbm target for fiscal deficit at the earliest and as soon as the negative effects of the global crisis on the indian economy have been overcome. on the medium term fiscal perspective, i await the recommendations of the 13th finance commission.to bring the fiscal deficit under control, we have to initiate institutional reform measures during the current year itself. this is essential for maintaining a stable balance of payments, moderate interest rates and steady flow of external capital for corporate investment. these measures have to encompass all aspects of the budget such as subsidies, taxes, expenditure and disinvestment.fertilizer subsidyin the context of the nation's food security, the declining response of agricultural productivity to increased fertilizer usage in the country is a matter of concern. to ensure balanced application of fertilizers, the government intends to move towards a nutrient based subsidy regime instead of the current product pricing regime. it will lead to availability of innovative fertilizer products in the market at reasonable prices. this unshackling of the fertilizer manufacturing sector is expected to attract fresh investments in this sector. in due course it is also intended to move to a system of direct transfer of subsidy to the farmers.petroleum and diesel pricing policymadam speaker, honourable members are aware that global prices of oil and petroleum products had shot up to unprecedented levels in 2008-09. most oil importing countries, including our neighbours, adjusted their domestic prices to reflect these global changes. though prices have declined since then, they are already about double of the lows reached in the wake of the global financial crisis. it is important to recognise that, with almost three-quarters of our oil consumption met through imports, domestic prices of petrol and diesel have to be broadly in sync with global prices of these items. government will set up an expert group to advise on a viable and sustainable system of pricing petroleum products. details will be announced by my colleague, the minister of petroleum and natural gas.taxationit is time that we complete the process that was started in 1991 for building a trust based, simple, neutral, tax system with almost no exemptions and low rates designed to promote voluntary compliance. the income tax return forms should be simple and user-friendly. i have asked the department to work on saral-ii forms for early introduction. we need a tax system which generates revenues on a sustained basis without use of coercive tax collection methods at the end of each year to meet targets. it is my intention to make a modest start in this direction in the current year and ensure that the process is completed in the next four years. at the end of this process, i hope the finance minister can credibly say that our tax collectors are like honey bees collecting nectar from the flowers without disturbing them, but spreading their pollen so that all flowers can thrive and bear fruit.people's ownership of psusthe public sector undertakings are the wealth of the nation, and part of this wealth should rest in the hands of the people. while retaining at least 51 per cent government equity in our enterprises, i propose to encourage people's participation in our disinvestment programme. here, i must state clearly that public sector enterprises such as banks and insurance companies will remain in the public sector and will be given all support, including capital infusion, to grow and remain competitive.financial sectorthe financial sector is the life blood of any economy. our government's approach to the banking and financial sector has been to ensure robust oversight and regulation while expanding financial access and deepening markets. the merit of this balanced approach has been borne out in the recent experience, as the turbulence in the world financial markets has left the indian banking and financial sector relatively unaffected. never before has indira gandhi's bold decision to nationalise our banking system exactly 40 years ago - on 14th of july, 1969 - appeared as wise and visionary as it has over the past few months. her approach continues to be our inspiration even as we introduce competition and new technology in this sector.the average public float in indian listed companies is less than 15 per cent. deep non-manipulable markets require larger and diversified public shareholdings. this requirement should be uniformly applied to the private sector as well as listed public sector companies. i propose to raise, in a phased manner, the threshold for non-promoter public shareholding for all listed companies.for a country like ours, with significant sections of unbanked population and regions, financial inclusion is vital for sustaining long term equitable development. as part of the financial inclusion drive, scheduled commercial banks have been opening 'no frills' accounts either with 'nil' or very low minimum balances. so far, these banks have opened 3.3 crore such accounts. the rbi has announced a further relaxation in its branch authorisation policy. scheduled commercial banks are now allowed to set up off-site atms without prior approval, subject to reporting.despite the expansion of banking network in the country, there are still some areas that remain under-banked or unbanked. a sub-committee of state level bankers committee ( slb c) will identify such areas and formulate an action plan for providing banking facilities to all these areas in the next 3 years. i propose to set aside rs.100 crore during the current year as one-time grant-in-aid to ensure provision of at least one centre/point of sales (pos) for banking services in each of the unbanked blocks in the country.the government has established competition commission of india, an autonomous regulatory body to promote and sustain competition in markets, protect interests of consumers and to prevent practices having adverse effect on competition. an appellate body headed by a retired judge of the supreme court has also been constituted.the benefits of competition should now come to more sectors and their users and consumers. now is the time for us to work on these aspects to eliminate supply bottlenecks, enhance productivity, reduce costs and improve quality of goods and services supplied to consumers.investment environmentprivate sector investment has been affected by the global macro economic conditions. our government is committed to creating a facilitating environment in which a competitive private sector can thrive and play its rightful role in nation's economic development. india 's high growth of 8.5% per annum from 2004 to 2008 was fuelled in very large part by private investment. i look forward to working closely with industry and our vibrant entrepreneurial community to address their outstanding concerns.towards inclusive developmentmadam speaker, the upa government has gone for a paradigm shift for making the development process more inclusive. it involves creating entitlements backed by legal guarantee to provide basic amenities and opportunities for livelihood to vulnerable sections. 'aam admi' is now the focus of all our programmes and schemes.national rural employment guarantee scheme (nregs)46. (i) it is widely acknowledged that the national rural employment guarantee act, (nrega) first implemented in february 2006, has been a magnificent success. during 2008-09, nrega provided employment opportunities for more than 4.47 crore households as against 3.39 crore households covered in 2007-08. we are committed to providing a real wage of rs.100 a day as an entitlement under the nrega. to increase the productivity of assets and resources under nrega, convergence with other schemes relating to agriculture, forests, water resources, land resources and rural roads is being initiated. in the first stage, a total of 115 pilot districts have been selected for such convergence. details of these measures and convergence guidelines will be announced by my colleague, the minister of rural development. i propose an allocation of rs.39,100 crore for the year 2009-10 for nrega which marks an increase of 144% over 2008-09 budget estimates.national food security act (nfsa)(ii) i am happy to announce that the work on national food security act has begun in right earnest. this will ensure that every family living below the poverty line in rural or urban areas will be entitled by law to 25 kilos of rice or wheat per month at rs.3 a kilo. the government proposes to put the draft food security bill on the website of the department of food and public distribution for public debate and consultations very soon.bharat nirman(iii) bharat nirman with its six schemes is an important initiative for bridging the gap between the rural and urban areas and improving the quality of life of people, particularly the poor, in the rural areas. i propose to step up the allocations for bharat nirman by 45 per cent in 2009-10 over the be of 2008-09. the pradhan mantri gram sadak yojana (pmgsy) is one of the most successful programmes under bharat nirman. i propose to step up the allocation for this programme by 59% over be 2008-09 to rs.12,000 crore. i also propose to allocate rs.7,000 crore to rajiv gandhi grameen viduytikaran yojana (rggvy) which represents a 27 per cent increase over 2008-09 (be).(iv) the allocation for the indira awaas yojana ( iay) is proposed to be increased by 63 per cent to rs.8,800 crore in budget estimates 2009-10. to broaden the pace of rural housing, i propose to allocate, from the shortfall in the priority sector lending of commercial banks, a sum of rs.2,000 crore for rural housing fund in the national housing bank (nhb). this will boost the resource base of nhb for their refinance operations in rural housing sector.pradhan mantri adarsh gram yojana (pmagy)(v) there are about 44,000 villages in which the population of scheduled castes is above 50 per cent. a new scheme called pradhan mantri adarsh gram yojana (pmagy) is being launched this year on a pilot basis, for the integrated development of 1000 such villages. i propose an allocation of rs.100 crore for this scheme. each village would be able to avail gap funding of rs.10 lakh over and above the allocations under rural development and poverty alleviation schemes. on successful implementation of the pilot phase, the yojana would be extended in coming years.empowerment of weaker sectionsthe swarna jayanti gram swarozgar yojna (sgsy) is being restructured as the national rural livelihood mission to make it universal in application, focused in approach and time bound for poverty eradication by 2014-15. stress will be laid on the formation of women self help groups (shgs). apart from providing capital subsidy at an enhanced rate, it is also proposed to provide interest subsidy to poor households for loans upto rs. one lakh from banks.the women's self help group movement is bringing about a profound transformation in rural areas. there are today over 22 lakh such groups linked with banks. our objective is to enrol at least 50% of all rural women in india as members of shgs over the next five years and link these shgs to banks.the rashtriya mahila kosh has been working towards the facilitation of credit support or micro finance to poor women and has developed a number of innovative schemes for their benefit. in recognition of its role as an instrument of socio-economic change and development, the corpus of the kosh, which at present is rs.100 crore, would be raised to rs.500 crore, over the next few years.female literacythe low level of female literacy continues to be a matter of grave concern. it has, therefore, been decided to launch a national mission for female literacy, with focus on minorities, sc, st and other marginalised groups. the aim will be to reduce by half, the current level of female illiteracy, in three years.integrated child development servicesgovernment is committed to universalisation of the integrated child development services (icds) scheme in the country. by march 2012, all services under icds would be extended, with quality, to every child under the age of six.student loans to weaker sectionsto enable students from economically weaker sections to access higher education, it is proposed to introduce a scheme to provide them full interest subsidy during the period of moratorium. it will cover loans taken by such students from scheduled banks to pursue any of the approved courses of study, in technical and professional streams, from recognised institutions in india . it is estimated that over 5 lakh students would avail of this benefit.welfare of minoritiesthe plan outlay of ministry of minority affairs has been enhanced from rs.1,000 crore in be 2008-09 to rs.1,740 crore in 2009-10, registering an increase of 74%. this includes rs.990 crore for multi-sectoral development programme for minorities in selected minority concentration districts, grants-in-aid to maulana azad education foundation which is almost doubled, and provisions for national minorities development and finance corporation and pre-matric and post-matric scholarships for minorities. allocations have also been made for the new schemes of national fellowship for students from the minority community and grants-in-aid to central wakf council for computerization of records of state wakf boards.aligarh muslim university has decided to establish its campuses at murshidabad in west bengal and malappuram in kerala. i propose to make an allocation of rs.25 crore each for these two campuses.welfare of workers in the unorganised sectorthe unorganised or informal sector of our economy accounts for 92% of the employment and absorbs bulk of the annual increase in our labour force. the unorganised workers social security bill, 2007 has now been passed by both houses of parliament. i have already initiated action to ensure that social security schemes for occupations like weavers, fishermen and women, toddy tappers, leather and handicraft workers, plantation labour, construction labour, mine workers, bidi workers, and rikshaw pullers are implemented at the earliest. necessary financial allocations will be made for these schemes.employment exchangesi propose to launch a new project for modernisation of the employment exchanges in public private partnership so that a job seeker can register on-line from anywhere and approach any employment exchange. under the project, a national web portal with common software will be developed. this will contain all the data regarding availability of skilled persons on the one hand and requirements of skilled persons by the industry on the other. it will help youth get placed and enable industry to procure required skills on real time basis.handloomsin the last budget two mega handloom clusters at varanasi and sibsagar and two mega powerloom clusters at erode and bhiwandi were approved. they are under successful implementation. i propose to add one handloom mega cluster each in west bengal and tamil nadu and one powerloom mega cluster in rajasthan. these will help preserve the magnificent textile traditions in west bengal and tamil nadu and generate thousands of jobs in rajasthan. in addition, i propose to add new mega clusters for carpets in srinagar (j&k) and mirzapur (up).healththe national rural health mission is an essential instrument for achieving our goal of health for all. i propose an increase of rs.2,057 crore over and above rs.12,070 crore provided in the interim budget.rashtriya swasthya bima yojana (rsby) was operationalised last year. the initial response has been very good. more than 46 lakh bpl families in eighteen states and uts have been issued biometric smart cards. this scheme empowers poor families by giving them freedom of choice for using health care services from an extensive list of hospitals including private hospitals. government proposes to bring all bpl families under this scheme. an amount of rs.350 crore, marking 40% increase over the previous allocation, is being provided in 2009-10 budget estimates.environment and climate changethe national action plan on climate change unveiled last year, outlines our strategy to adapt to climate change and enhance the ecological sustainability of our development path. following this, eight national missions representing a multi-pronged, long term and integrated approach are being launched. i propose to provide necessary funds for these missions.our government has already set up a 'national ganga river basin authority' (ngrba). i propose increasing the budgetary outlay for the national river and lake conservation plans to rs.562 crore in 2009-10 from rs.335 crore in 2008-09.i propose to make a special one-time grant of rs.100 crore to the indian council of forestry research and education, dehradun in recognition of its excellence in the field of research, education and extension. i also propose an allocation of rs.15 crore each for the botanical survey of india and zoological survey of india. an additional amount of rs.15 crore is being allocated to geological survey of india.towards building accountable institutionsimproving delivery of public servicesas substantial resources, both public and private, are mobilized to fuel the growth of the economy and make it more inclusive in character, efficiency of delivery must become the focus of government programmes. the enactment of the right to information act at the centre and in many states has been an important and successful step in this direction, ushering in greater transparency and accountability in the public decision-making process.the setting up of the unique identification authority of india (uidai) is a major step in improving governance with regard to delivery of public services. this project is very close to my heart. i am happy to note that this project also marks the beginning of an era where the top private sector talent in india steps forward to take the responsibility for implementing projects of vital national importance. the uidai will set up an online data base with identity and biometric details of indian residents and provide enrolment and verification services across the country. the first set of unique identity numbers will be rolled out in 12 to 18 months. i have proposed a provision of rs.120 crore for this project.national securityfor modernisation of police force in the states, an additional amount of rs.430 crore is being proposed, over and above the provisions in the interim budget. the government has also sanctioned special risk/hardship allowances to the personnel of para military forces at par with defence forces. provisions for payment of these allowances are also being proposed in the budget.for strengthening border management, an additional amount of rs.2,284 crore, over and above the provision in the interim budget, is being provided for construction of fences, roads, flood-lights on the international borders.significant augmentation in the strength of para-military forces is being done. this calls for more investment in creating the necessary infrastructure, particularly in the area of housing. the government, therefore, proposes to launch a massive programme of housing to create 1 lakh dwelling units for central para-military forces personnel. this will not only contribute to the morale of the forces, but will also enable leveraging of government's annual budgetary resources and create an innovative financing model.one rank one pension for ex-servicemen (orop)our country owes a deep debt of gratitude to our valiant ex-servicemen. the committee headed by the cabinet secretary on orop has submitted its report and the recommendations of the committee have been accepted. on the basis of these recommendations, the government has decided to substantially improve the pension of pre 1.1.2006 defence pensioners below officer rank (pbor) and bring pre 10.10.1997 pensioners on par with post 10.10.1997 pensioners. both these decisions will be implemented from 1st july 2009 resulting in enhanced pension for more than 12 lakh jawans and jcos. these measures will cost the exchequer more than rs.2,100 crore annually. certain pension benefits being extended to war wounded and other disabled pensioners are also being liberalised.educationthe demographic advantage india has in terms of a large percentage of young population needs to be converted into a dynamic economic advantage by providing them the right education and skills. the provision for the scheme, ' mission in education through ict,' has been substantially increased to rs.900 crore. similarly, the provision for setting up and up-gradation of polytechnics under the skill development mission has been increased to rs.495 crore. the government shall take forward its intent of having one central university in each uncovered state and for this purpose i am allocating rs.827 crore. i am also allocating rs.2,113 crore for iits and nits, which includes a provision of rs.450 crore for new iits and nits. the overall plan budget for higher education is proposed to be increased by rs.2,000 crore over interim be.union territory of chandigarh is the capital of punjab and haryana. the facilities at punjab university , chandigarh , need to be improved. i, therefore, propose to make an allocation of rs.50 crore for this university. to enable the union territory administration to provide better infrastructure to the people, i propose to suitably enhance the plan allocation for chandigarh during the current financial year.commonwealth games 2010the commonwealth games present the country with an opportunity to showcase our potential as an emerging asian power. i propose to substantially enhance the allocations for the commonwealth games from rs.2,112 crore in the interim budget to rs.3,472 crore in the budget for 2009-10.madam speaker, the government is committed to ensure that sri lankan tamils enjoy their rights and legitimate aspirations within the territorial sovereignty and framework of sri lanka 's constitution. the ministry of external affairs is working closely with the sri lankan government in this regard. i propose to allocate rs. 500 crore for the rehabilitation of the internally displaced persons and reconstruction of the northern and eastern areas of sri lanka.as honourable members are aware, cyclone aila struck the coast of west bengal in the last week of may 2009. extensive damage was caused to roads, houses and infrastructure. while immediate interim relief has been provided from the calamity relief fund (crf), it is proposed to draw up a programme for rebuilding the damaged infrastructure. for this purpose, i propose to allocate rs.1,000 crore.budget estimates 2009-10madam speaker, now i turn to the budget estimates for 2009-10.the budget estimates 2009-10 provide for a total expenditure of rs.10,20,838 crore consisting of rs.6,95,689 crore towards non plan and rs.3,25,149 crore towards plan expenditure. the increase in non plan expenditure over be 2008-09 is 37% whereas the increase in plan expenditure is 34%. the total increase in expenditure in 2009-10 over be 2008-09 is 36%.the increase in non plan expenditure is mainly on account of the implementation of the sixth central pay commission recommendations, increased food subsidy and higher interest payment arising out of the larger fiscal deficit in 2008-09. interest payments are estimated at rs.2,25,511 crore constituting about 36% of non plan revenue expenditure in be 2009-10. the total provision for subsidies are up from rs.71,431 crore in be 2008-09 to rs.1,11,276 crore in be 2009-10. the outlay on defence has gone up from rs.1,05,600 crore in be 2008-09 to rs.1,41,703 crore in be 2009-10.honourable members may recall that while presenting the interim budget 2009-10, i had stated that the plan expenditure for 2009-10 may have to be increased further as a part of counter-cyclical measures to minimise the impact of global recession and economic slowdown. against the backdrop of limited fiscal space because of reduction in cenvat and service tax rates, government have taken a conscious and bold decision to enhance the gross budgetary support (gbs) for the annual plan 2009-10 by rs.40,000 crore over interim budget 2009-10. bulk of this enhanced gbs is directed towards public investment in infrastructure with special emphasis on rural infrastructure, raising growth potential and leading to income generation. besides, the state governments will be permitted to borrow additional 0.5% of their gsdp by relaxing the fiscal deficit target under frbm from 3.5% to 4% of their gsdp. this will enable the state governments to raise additional open market loans of about rs.21,000 crore in the current year. in other words, the total additionality in plan expenditure by centre and the states put together would be rs.61,000 crore over interim budget. i do believe that this fiscal expansion will go a long way in reversing the impact of economic slowdown and accelerate our growth revival in the medium term.madam speaker, given the possibility of the economic downturn persisting in the current year, the gross tax receipts are budgeted at rs.6,41,079 crore in be 2009-10, compared to rs.6,87,715 crore in be 2008-09. the non tax revenue receipts are, however, likely to be better and are estimated at rs.1,40,279 crore in be 2009-10 compared to rs.95,785 crore in be 2008-09. the revenue deficit as a percentage of gdp is projected at 4.8% compared to 1% in be 2008-09 and 4.6% as per provisional accounts of 2008-09. the fiscal deficit as a percentage of gdp is projected at 6.8% compared to 2.5% in be 2008-09 and 6.2% as per provisional accounts 2008-09. this level of deficit is a matter of concern and government will address this issue in right earnest to come back to the path of fiscal consolidation at the earliest.madam speaker, before i turn to my tax proposals, i cannot resist the temptation of re-visiting kautilya. he said and i quote, ""just as one plucks fruits from a garden as they ripen, so shall a king have revenue collected as it becomes due. just as one does not collect unripe fruits, he shall avoid taking wealth that is not due because that will make the people angry and spoil the very sources of revenue.""part - btax proposalsmadam speaker, i shall now present my tax proposals.as the house is aware, the thrust of reforms over the last few years, including the previous term of this government, has been to improve the efficiency and equity of our tax system. this is sought to be achieved by eliminating distortions in the tax structure, introducing moderate levels of taxation and expanding the base. these policy changes have been accompanied by requisite re-engineering of key business processes coupled with automation, both for direct and indirect taxes. on the direct tax side, a recent initiative for further improving efficiency is the setting up of a centralized processing centre (cpc) at bengaluru where all electronically filed returns, and paper returns filed in entire karnataka, will be processed.these tax reform initiatives have produced impressive results. the centre's tax- gdp ratio has increased to 11.5 per cent in 2008-09 from a low of 9.2 per cent in 2003-04. the healthy growth in tax revenues over the last five years is essentially attributable to growth in direct taxes. further, the share of direct taxes in the centre's tax revenues has increased to 56 per cent in 2008-09 from 41 per cent in 2003-04, reflecting a sharp improvement in the equity of our tax system. the government is committed to furthering this process of tax reform.in the course of preparation of this budget, i have had the opportunity to interact with large number of stakeholders and receive valuable inputs. most suggestions were for structural changes in the tax system. tax reform, like all reforms, is a process and not an event. therefore, i propose to pursue structural changes in direct taxes by releasing the new direct taxes code within the next 45 days and in indirect taxes by accelerating the process for the smooth introduction of the goods and services tax (gst) with effect from 1st april, 2010 .the direct taxes code, along with a discussion paper, will be released to the public for debate. based on the inputs received, the government will finalise the direct taxes code bill for introduction in this house sometime during the winter session.to further enhance efficiency in tax administration, i intend to merge the two authorities for advance rulings on direct and indirect taxes by amending the relevant acts. this will enable the authority for advance rulings set up under section 245-o of the income tax act, 1961 to also function as the authority for advance rulings for indirect taxes.i have been informed that the empowered committee of state finance ministers has made considerable progress in preparing the roadmap and the design of the gst. officials from the central government have also been associated in this exercise. i am glad to inform the house that, through their collaborative efforts, they have reached an agreement on the basic structure in keeping with the principles of fiscal federalism enshrined in the constitution. i compliment the empowered committee of state finance ministers for their untiring efforts. the broad contour of the gst model is that it will be a dual gst comprising of a central gst and a state gst. the centre and the states will each legislate, levy and administer the central gst and state gst, respectively. i will reinforce the central government's catalytic role to facilitate the introduction of gst by 1st april, 2010 after due consultations with all stakeholders.direct taxesi shall now deal with direct taxes.madam speaker, there have been demands by the corporate sector for reduction in tax rates. however, tax rates are determined by the size of the tax base; if the tax base is higher, the tax rates can be lower. the income tax act is riddled with a plethora of tax exemptions which substantially erode the tax base. the extent of this erosion is presented to this house in the form of a revenue foregone statement. the growth in the direct tax revenue foregone is relatively higher than the growth in the direct tax revenues. accordingly, i do not propose to make any change in the corporate tax rates.with a view to providing interim relief to small and marginal taxpayers and senior citizens, i propose to increase the personal income tax exemption limit by rs.15,000 from rs.2.25 lakh to rs.2.40 lakh for senior citizens. similarly i also propose to raise the exemption limit by rs.10,000 from rs.1.80 lakh to rs.1.90 lakh for women tax payers and by rs.10,000 from rs.1.50 lakh to rs.1.60 lakh for all other categories of individual taxpayers. further, i also propose to increase the deduction under section 80-dd in respect of maintenance, including medical treatment, of a dependent who is a person with severe disability to rs.1 lakh from the present limit of rs.75,000.in the past, surcharges on direct taxes have generally been levied to meet the revenue needs arising from natural calamities. the government has set up the national calamity contingency fund to build up resources to meet emergency situations. as a corollary, surcharge on direct taxes should be removed. however, this has to be balanced with the revenue needs of the government. therefore, in the first instance, i propose to phase out the surcharge on various direct taxes by eliminating the surcharge of 10 per cent on personal income tax.deduction in respect of export profits is available under sections 10a and 10b of the income-tax act. the deduction under these sections would not be available beyond the financial year 2009-2010. in order to tide over the slowdown in exports, i propose to extend the sun-set clauses for these tax holidays by one more year i.e. for the financial year 2010-11.the finance act, 2005 introduced the fringe benefit tax on the value of certain fringe benefits provided by employers to their employees. this tax has been perceived as imposing considerable compliance burden. empathising with these sentiments, i propose to abolish the fringe benefit tax.the competitive ability of an economy rests on its progress in the area of research and development (r&d). in order to incentivise the corporate sector to undertake r&d work, i propose to extend the scope of the current provision of weighted deduction of 150% on expenditure incurred on in-house r&d to all manufacturing businesses except for a small negative list.under the present scheme of the income tax act, tax exemptions are largely profit-linked. such incentives are inherently inefficient and liable to misuse. therefore, it is proposed to incentivise businesses by providing investment-linked tax exemptions. to begin with, i propose to extend investment- linked tax incentives to the businesses of setting up and operating 'cold chain', warehousing facilities for storing agricultural produce and the business of laying and operating cross country natural gas or crude or petroleum oil pipeline network for distribution on common carrier principle. under this method, all capital expenditure, other than expenditure on land, goodwill and financial instruments will be fully allowable as deduction.minimum alternate tax (mat) was introduced to address inequity in taxation of corporate taxpayers. in the quest for greater equity, i propose to increase the rate of mat to 15 per cent of book profits from the present rate of 10 per cent. however, to grant relief to corporate taxpayers, i also propose to extend the period allowed to carry forward the tax credit under mat from seven years to ten years.the new pension system (nps) is an important milestone in the development of a sustainable, efficient, voluntary and defined contribution pension system in india . while the nps will continue to be subjected to the exempt-exempt-taxed (eet) method of tax treatment of savings, it is proposed to provide necessary fiscal support to the nps for the establishment of this much needed social security system. accordingly, i propose to exempt the income of the nps trust from income tax and any dividend paid to this trust from dividend distribution tax. similarly, all purchase and sale of equity shares and derivatives by the nps trust will also be exempt from the securities transaction tax. i also propose to enable self employed persons to participate in the nps and avail of the tax benefits available thereto.in order to further improve the investment climate in the country, we need to facilitate the resolution of tax disputes faced by foreign companies within a reasonable time frame. this is particularly relevant for such companies in the information technology (it) sector. i, therefore, propose to create an alternative dispute resolution mechanism within the income tax department for the resolution of transfer pricing disputes. to reduce the impact of judgemental errors in determining transfer price in international transactions, it is proposed to empower the central board of direct taxes (cbdt) to formulate 'safe harbour' rules.the finance act, 2008 introduced the commodity transaction tax (ctt) to be levied on taxable commodities transactions entered in a recognized association. the prime minister's economic advisory council has recommended abolition of the ctt. i, therefore, propose to abolish the commodity transaction tax.the house will agree that it is desirable to bring about transparency in the funding of political parties in the country. with a view to reforming the system of funding of political parties, i propose to provide that donations to electoral trusts shall be allowed as a 100 per cent deduction in the computation of the income of the donor. for this purpose, electoral trusts will be such trusts as are set up as pass-through vehicles for routing the donations to political parties and are approved by cbdt.section 80e of the income-tax act provides for a deduction in respect of interest on loans taken for pursuing higher education in specified fields of study. i propose to extend the scope of this provision to cover all fields of study, including vocational studies, pursued after completion of schooling.anonymous donations to charitable institutions are presently liable to tax so as to prevent unaccounted money being routed to such entities in the garb of anonymous donations. however, some organisations are facing genuine problems in complying with the procedural requirements. in order to mitigate the practical difficulties being faced by such charitable organisations, i propose to grant relief to such organisations by not taxing anonymous donations received to the extent of 5 per cent of their total income or a sum of rs.1 lakh, whichever is higher.to facilitate the business operations of all small taxpayers and reduce their compliance burden, i propose to expand the scope of presumptive taxation to all small businesses with a turnover upto rs.40 lakh. all such taxpayers will have the option to declare their income from business at the rate of 8 per cent of their turnover and simultaneously enjoy exemption from the compliance burden of maintaining books of accounts. as a procedural simplification, i also propose to allow them to pay their entire tax liability from business at the time of filing their return by exempting them from paying advance tax. this new scheme will come into effect from the financial year 2010-11.madam speaker, in the context of the geo-political environment, it is necessary for us to create our own facilities for energy security. accordingly, i propose to extend the tax holiday under section 80-ib(9) of the income tax act, which was hitherto available in respect of profits arising from the commercial production or refining of mineral oil, also to natural gas. this tax benefit will be available to undertakings in respect of profits derived from the commercial production of mineral oil and natural gas from oil and gas blocks which are awarded under the new exploration licensing policy-viii round of bidding. further, i also propose to retrospectively amend the provisions of the said section to provide that ""undertaking"" for the purposes of section 80-ib(9) will mean all blocks awarded in any single contract.under the present provisions of section 2 (15) of the income tax act, ""charitable purpose"" includes relief of the poor, education, medical relief, and the ""advancement of any other object of general public utility"". however, the ""advancement of any other object of general public utility"" cannot involve the carrying on of any activity in the nature of trade, commerce or business. i propose to provide the same tax treatment to trusts engaged in preserving and improving our environment (including watersheds, forests and wildlife) and preserving our monuments or places or objects of artistic or historic interest, as is available to trusts engaged in providing relief of the poor, education and medical relief.indirect taxesmadam speaker, i turn to my main proposals on indirect taxes.i will first take up customs duties.although our domestic industry has weathered the impact of the global financial crisis and the resultant slowdown with resilience, it is yet to fully find its feet. manufacturing growth, which had turned negative in october 2008 on a year-on-year basis and remained in that zone till march this year, appears to be barely turning the corner. however, the global scenario remains worrisome and it is my view that the paramount need is to provide industry with a stable framework. my proposals on indirect taxes seek to achieve this by maintaining the overall rate structure for customs and central excise duties as well as service tax. i must hasten to add that i have not hesitated to act where distortions provide a compelling reason or where relief would provide a healing touch.full exemption from basic customs duty was provided to set top boxes in 2006 to enable their free import for the smooth introduction of the conditional access system (cas). now that production capacity has come up in the country, i propose to impose a nominal basic customs duty of 5 per cent on such set top boxes to encourage domestic value addition.the electronic hardware industry has a strong potential for creating employment especially in the sme sector. i intend to reduce the basic customs duty on lcd panels from 10 per cent to 5 per cent to support indigenous production of lcd televisions.full exemption from cvd of 4 per cent was available to accessories, parts and components imported for the manufacture of mobile phones till the 30th of june, 2009 . i propose to reintroduce this exemption for another year.for reasons that are apparent, industry sectors having an export-orientation have been adversely impacted by the demand compression in global markets. presently, exporters of leather products, textile garments, footwear as well as sports goods are permitted to import raw materials, consumables etc. upto 3 per cent of the fob value of their exports free of duty. i propose to add a few more items to these lists. full exemption from basic customs duty is being provided to rough corals for encouraging value-addition and export.it is imperative that the contribution of new and renewable energy sources of power is enhanced if we have to successfully combat the phenomena of global warming and climate change. i am reducing the basic customs duty on permanent magnets - a critical component for wind operated electricity generators - from 7.5 per cent to 5 per cent.on influenza vaccine and nine specified life saving drugs used for the treatment of breast cancer, hepatitis-b, rheumatic arthritis etc. and on bulk drugs used for the manufacture of such drugs, i propose to reduce the customs duty from 10 per cent to 5 per cent. they will also be totally exempt from excise duty and countervailing duty.customs duty will also be reduced from 7.5 per cent to 5 per cent on two specified life saving devices used in treatment of heart conditions. these devices will be fully exempt from excise duty and cvd also.gold bars currently attract customs duty at the specific rate of rs.100 per ten grams while other forms of gold (excluding jewellery) are chargeable to a duty of rs.250 per ten grams. these rates were fixed in 2004 and have not been reviewed even as the price of gold has increased manifold. i propose to partially restore the incidence by increasing these rates to rs.200 per ten grams and rs.500 per ten grams respectively. along the same lines, the customs duty on silver (excluding jewellery) will be increased from rs.500 per kg to rs.1,000 per kg. these revised rates would also apply to gold and silver, including ornaments that are not studded, when imported by a bona fide passenger as baggage.i will now come to central excise duties.hon'ble members are aware that the government announced a series of fiscal stimulus packages, one of the key elements of which was the sharp reduction in the ad valorem rates of central excise duty for non-petroleum products by 4 percentage points across the board on 7th of december 2008 and by another 2 percentage points in the mean cenvat rate on the 24th of february, 2009.one of the consequences of these cuts was that pure cotton textiles came to be fully exempted from excise duty. we have received representations that full exemption prevents manufacturers from availing of export rebate of the duty paid from cenvat credit. i propose to rectify this situation by restoring the erstwhile optional rate of 4 per cent for cotton textiles beyond the fibre stage.ever since the revamp of the excise duty structure on textiles by my distinguished predecessor in the 2004 budget, a differential in rates has been maintained between the cotton sector and the manmade sector. in keeping with the integrity of the earlier structure, i propose to restore the rate of 8 per cent central excise duty on manmade fibre and yarn on a mandatory basis and on stages beyond fibre and yarn at that rate on optional basis. these changes, together with duty changes on intermediates, would imply that the duty on all types of manmade fibre and yarn and their intermediates would be the same, easing the problem of credit accumulation.wool waste and cotton waste are chargeable to basic customs duty of 15 per cent. these are used in the manufacture of cheaper varieties of textile articles such as blankets and rugs. as a measure of relief to this sector, i propose to reduce the basic customs duty on these items to 10 per cent.with the government's proclaimed objective of introducing a goods and services tax (gst) both at the national and state level, some more steps in that direction are necessary. one measure that would facilitate the process is the further convergence of central excise duty rates to a mean rate - currently 8 per cent. i have reviewed the list of items currently attracting the rate of 4 per cent, the only rate below the mean rate. there is a case for enhancing the rate on many items appearing in this list to 8 per cent, which i propose to do, with the following major exceptions:a. food items; andb. drugs, pharmaceuticals and medical equipment.c. some of the other items on which i propose to retain the rate of 4 per cent are:d. paper, paperboard & their articles;e. items of mass consumption such as pressure cookers, cheaper electric bulbs, low-priced footwear, water filters/purifiers, cfl etc.;f. power driven pumps for handling water; andg. paraxylene.the details are available in the relevant notifications.bio-diesel, obtained from vegetable oils and used for blending with petro-diesel, is currently exempt from excise duty. i now propose to fully exempt petro-diesel blended with bio-diesel from excise duty.in order to encourage the use of this environment friendly fuel and augment its availability in the country, i also propose to reduce basic customs duty on bio-diesel from 7.5 per cent to 2.5 per cent - at par with petro-diesel. with these proposals i hope to see a smile on the faces of the green brigade!my other proposals on central excise duties seek to address distortions that the manufacturing industry has been complaining about.the it industry has pointed out that it is facing difficulties in the assessment of software which involves transfer of the right to use after the levy of service tax on it software service. to resolve the matter, i propose to exempt the value attributable to the transfer of the right to use packaged software from excise duty and cvd.the construction industry has represented that they are facing difficulties on account of withdrawal of exemption on goods manufactured at site. i propose to restore full exemption to such goods, including pre-fabricated concrete slabs or blocks, when used for further construction at site.a specific component was added to the ad valorem duty of 24 per cent applicable to large cars and utility vehicles in june last year. in the case of vehicles of engine capacity below 2000 cc, this component was rs.15,000/- per unit while for vehicles of higher engine capacity it was rs.20,000/- per unit. these rates are now being unified at the lower level of rs.15,000/- per unit.petrol driven trucks provide a useful means of transport within cities and across short distances. these are chargeable to excise duty of 20 per cent. i propose to reduce excise duty on these trucks to 8 per cent to equate the duty with similar vehicles run on diesel.madam speaker, i fear that my proposals relating to gold and silver on the customs side would somewhat dent my popularity with women. i propose to salvage this by fully exempting branded jewellery from excise duty.i now turn to my proposals on service tax.it is an international practice to zero-rate exports. to achieve this objective, a scheme was announced in 2007, granting refund of service tax paid on certain taxable services used after the clearance of export goods from the factory. for some time now, the exporting community has been expressing dissatisfaction over the difficulties faced in obtaining such refunds. several procedural simplifications attempted in the past have also not yielded satisfactory results. the solution seems to lie in placing greater trust on the claims filed by the exporters. keeping this in view, i propose to make the following changes in the scheme:a. services received by exporters from goods transport agents and commission agents, where the liability to pay service tax is ab initio on the exporter, would be exempted from service tax. thus, there would be no need for the exporter to first pay the tax and later claim refund.b. for other services received by exporters, the exemption would be operated through the existing refund mechanism based on self-certification of the documents where such refund is below 0.25 per cent of fob value, and certification of documents by a chartered accountant for value of refund exceeding the above limit.c. the export promotion councils and the federation of indian export organizations (fieo) provide a valuable service in augmenting our export effort. i propose to exempt them from the levy of service tax on the membership and other fees collected by them till 31st march, 2010 .in the goods transport sector, service tax is currently levied on transport of goods by road, by air, through pipelines and in containers. however, goods carried by indian railways or those carried as coastal cargo or through inland waterways are not charged to service tax. in order to provide a level playing field in the goods transport sector, i propose to extend the levy of service tax to these modes of goods transport. the new levy is not likely to impact the prices of essential commodities or goods for mass consumption, as suitable exemptions would be provided.as the hon'ble members are aware, services provided by chartered accountants, cost accountants, and company secretaries as well as by engineering and management consultants are presently charged to service tax. although there is a school of thought that legal consultants do not provide any service to their client, i hold my distinguished predecessor in high esteem and disagree! as such, i propose to extend service tax on advice, consultancy or technical assistance provided in the field of law. this tax would not be applicable in case the service provider or the service receiver is an individual.vehicles having 'stage carriage permits' and run by state undertakings are exempted from service tax. however, transportation of passengers undertaken by private enterprises in vehicles having 'contract carriage permits' is, subjected to service tax. in order to bring parity in tax treatment, i propose to exempt such transportation also from the levy of service tax.in july, 2008 goods transport agents (gta) went on strike with several demands. one of the demands that was accepted by the government was to exempt certain services, such as packing, cargo handling and warehousing, provided to gtas en route, from service tax. for this purpose an exemption notification was issued. it was also demanded by goods transport agents that the proceedings already initiated against such service providers should be dropped. the government has accepted this genuine demand. therefore, i propose to make certain legislative changes required to fulfill this promise.copies of notifications giving effect to the changes in customs, central excise and service tax will be laid on the table of the house in due course.my tax proposals on direct taxes are revenue neutral. on indirect taxes, they are estimated to yield a net gain of rs.2,000 crore for a full year.conclusionas we begin this five year journey, the road ahead will not be easy. we will have to manage uncertainties and there will be as many problems as there would be solutions. mahatma gandhi said and i quote, ""democracy is the art and science of mobilizing the entire physical, economic and spiritual resources of various sections of the people in the service of the common good of all."" this is precisely what we will have to do. with strong hearts, enlightened minds and willing hands, we will have to overcome all odds and remove all obstacles to create a brave new india of our dreams.madam speaker, with these words i commend the budget to the house.",0.07405572471062219,full

""we decided to think big and expand. it is all about unlocking our imagination and freeing our mind. in 1999, infosys listed on nasdaq. when we realised we needed good work force, we set-up a world class campus in mysore in 2000, followed by a leadership academy,"" said nilekani.emphasising on the need for harnessing the power of youth, he said that their company had hugely benefited from youth with the average age at infosys being 27 years.he said that it was extremely important for india to reap the benefits of the demographic dividend that it enjoyed. ""india is a young country in an ageing world. we can fully realise the potential it gives us only by giving opportunities to the youth,"" he said.in fact, in response to a question by a young man in the audience about outsourcing, nilekani said that it was important for the youth to be a part of the global world. it would be more beneficial for the indian youth to contribute to the world by being a part of either the manufacturing industry, catering to other countries, or outsourcing. ""we have to be a part of the global economy and take advantage of the demographic dividend,"" he stressed.speaking on his completing a year in government as uidai chief, nilekani said in government functioning the trick was not to worry about small things but focus on a few big issues. ""it is not easy to get a bigger car in government but it is easy to get a financial sanction for an important project. the government is more receptive to big ideas,"" he said.nilekani also dismissed the notion that infosys had grown since the government did not breathe down their necks.

2011-11-03,highlights: india today state of states conclave 2011 ,"aroon purie's speech honorable chief ministers, ladies and gentlemen,it is my pleasure to welcome you to the 9th india today state of the states conclave.earlier this year in july, india completed twenty years of economic reforms. the abolition of the licence-permit raj that was started by then finance minister manmohan singh has transformed the economic landscape of the country. economic reform was not the only major transformation taking place in the country at around that time. the political landscape also underwent a change with the demise of the single party system at the centre.rajiv gandhi's single party congress government between 1984 and 1989 was to be the last to rule india with a clear majority of its own for the next quarter of a century. all the 7 prime ministers who followed rajiv gandhi in office, from v.p. singh to manmohan singh have had to rely on support outside their own parties to run their government.narasimha rao's minority congress government leant on the tiny regional outfit, the jharkhand mukti morcha, to ensure its survival.atal behari vajpayee's bjp-led nda coalition government was a big rainbow coalition of 22 parties. the decline of the congress was complemented in part by the rise of the bjp. it was also accompanied by the rise of a plethora of smaller parties, each of which had a strong regional base.over the last twenty years, these parties have exercised enormous influence in delhi participating in a variety of coalition governments. naturally, the concerns of the states they represent have found louder voice in what was often viewed as a distant new delhi.the nature of the centre has also changed with the rise of coalition politics and regional parties. it is no longer the powerful, almost unitary centre, of the 1960s and 1970s. it has weakened and at least some power has dispersed to state capitals.the future of this country, particularly in terms of the welfare and well being of its citizens, therefore depends on what happens in the capitals of our 30 states. and i am pleased to report that many states have recognized this proposition and are pushing ahead with well thought out and well implemented agendas of governance.gujarat has been growing at double digits, comfortably higher than the indian average of 8-9 percent for almost a decade. bihar, governed by the very able nitish kumar, recorded double digit growth last year.west bengal is on the move after a new government took office earlier this year.that these states are ruled by political parties across the spectrum is heartening. there seems to at last be a realization that good governance can deliver at the ballot box.this year, after much thought, we decided to make a major change in the methodology used to rank states. the purpose is to assess the dynamic process of incremental change across states rather than the more static performance over a longer period that we have been assessing in the past. for the first time, therefore, we are ranking states only on the basis of the improvement recorded across various sectoral categories in the last one year, between 2009-10 and 2010-11.the categories remain the same as in our past eight editions:agriculture, consumer market, primary health, primary education, governance, infrastructure, investment and macroeconomy. in addition to these, there is an overall category which aggregates the performance of states across the 8 sectoral categories.the new methodology helps to rid states of the weight of historical baggage. in the past, our rankings did not give enough credit to states which have been doing very well in recent times but because of a long history of underdevelopment lagged in the rankings.as a corollary, we perhaps gave too much credit to states which did very well once upon a time and thus have better overall parameters than other states but which have been stagnating in recent years. our rankings of most improved states this year gives clear priority to the states which are making progress in the present, not those which made progress in the past.the change in methodology has led to an interesting churn. i will not reveal the identities of any of the award winners right now. let that suspense last for a while longer. what i can reveal is that the new methodology has served the purpose of identifying states on the move.some of these, like assam for example, fared poorly on our old ranking system but do very well in terms of recent change. this seems to square up with political reality.chief minister tarun gogoi, who is here today, was elected to a third consecutive term in office earlier this year. he must be doing quite a bit right. on the other side, there are states like punjab, which have a long history of doing well, but which have been stagnating in recent times. then there are states like gujarat and maharashtra which continue to build impressively on their solid achievements of the past.our methodology may have changed, but the standards followed in conducting the study remain impeccable. the standout feature of this study is its complete objectivity. rankings of this kind often rely on subjective interpretations, either of those conducting the survey or of experts interviewed for their perceptions. india today's state of the states survey has consistently refrained from subjectivity. the study is 100 percent based on performance data. that is what gives it such wide acceptability and lends it such high credibility.we have two very fine economists, bibek debroy and laveesh bhandari, who have led this study over nine years. like every year, i am sure they will be happy to clarify any doubts that any of you may have.i hope that these rankings serve the purpose of promoting a healthy competition among states, the kind which leads to a race to the top, where each state adopts the best practices of others rather than a race to the bottom, where each states continuously demands concessions from the centre. a race to the top among states is what india needs to develop at a faster pace. it will also put pressure on the centre to give up its lethargy.let me take this opportunity to welcome you all once again. i am particularly grateful to the chief ministers, all winners and performers, who have joined us in our endeavour to make the india today state of the states report a blueprint for effective governance in india.thank you.session: can corruption be cured?petroleum minister s. jaipal

2011-11-04,highlights: india today state of states conclave 2011 ,"aroon purie's speech honorable chief ministers, ladies and gentlemen,it is my pleasure to welcome you to the 9th india today state of the states conclave.earlier this year in july, india completed twenty years of economic reforms. the abolition of the licence-permit raj that was started by then finance minister manmohan singh has transformed the economic landscape of the country. economic reform was not the only major transformation taking place in the country at around that time. the political landscape also underwent a change with the demise of the single party system at the centre.rajiv gandhi's single party congress government between 1984 and 1989 was to be the last to rule india with a clear majority of its own for the next quarter of a century. all the 7 prime ministers who followed rajiv gandhi in office, from v.p. singh to manmohan singh have had to rely on support outside their own parties to run their government.narasimha rao's minority congress government leant on the tiny regional outfit, the jharkhand mukti morcha, to ensure its survival.atal behari vajpayee's bjp-led nda coalition government was a big rainbow coalition of 22 parties. the decline of the congress was complemented in part by the rise of the bjp. it was also accompanied by the rise of a plethora of smaller parties, each of which had a strong regional base.over the last twenty years, these parties have exercised enormous influence in delhi participating in a variety of coalition governments. naturally, the concerns of the states they represent have found louder voice in what was often viewed as a distant new delhi.the nature of the centre has also changed with the rise of coalition politics and regional parties. it is no longer the powerful, almost unitary centre, of the 1960s and 1970s. it has weakened and at least some power has dispersed to state capitals.the future of this country, particularly in terms of the welfare and well being of its citizens, therefore depends on what happens in the capitals of our 30 states. and i am pleased to report that many states have recognized this proposition and are pushing ahead with well thought out and well implemented agendas of governance.gujarat has been growing at double digits, comfortably higher than the indian average of 8-9 percent for almost a decade. bihar, governed by the very able nitish kumar, recorded double digit growth last year.west bengal is on the move after a new government took office earlier this year.that these states are ruled by political parties across the spectrum is heartening. there seems to at last be a realization that good governance can deliver at the ballot box.this year, after much thought, we decided to make a major change in the methodology used to rank states. the purpose is to assess the dynamic process of incremental change across states rather than the more static performance over a longer period that we have been assessing in the past. for the first time, therefore, we are ranking states only on the basis of the improvement recorded across various sectoral categories in the last one year, between 2009-10 and 2010-11.the categories remain the same as in our past eight editions:agriculture, consumer market, primary health, primary education, governance, infrastructure, investment and macroeconomy. in addition to these, there is an overall category which aggregates the performance of states across the 8 sectoral categories.the new methodology helps to rid states of the weight of historical baggage. in the past, our rankings did not give enough credit to states which have been doing very well in recent times but because of a long history of underdevelopment lagged in the rankings.as a corollary, we perhaps gave too much credit to states which did very well once upon a time and thus have better overall parameters than other states but which have been stagnating in recent years. our rankings of most improved states this year gives clear priority to the states which are making progress in the present, not those which made progress in the past.the change in methodology has led to an interesting churn. i will not reveal the identities of any of the award winners right now. let that suspense last for a while longer. what i can reveal is that the new methodology has served the purpose of identifying states on the move.some of these, like assam for example, fared poorly on our old ranking system but do very well in terms of recent change. this seems to square up with political reality.chief minister tarun gogoi, who is here today, was elected to a third consecutive term in office earlier this year. he must be doing quite a bit right. on the other side, there are states like punjab, which have a long history of doing well, but which have been stagnating in recent times. then there are states like gujarat and maharashtra which continue to build impressively on their solid achievements of the past.our methodology may have changed, but the standards followed in conducting the study remain impeccable. the standout feature of this study is its complete objectivity. rankings of this kind often rely on subjective interpretations, either of those conducting the survey or of experts interviewed for their perceptions. india today's state of the states survey has consistently refrained from subjectivity. the study is 100 percent based on performance data. that is what gives it such wide acceptability and lends it such high credibility.we have two very fine economists, bibek debroy and laveesh bhandari, who have led this study over nine years. like every year, i am sure they will be happy to clarify any doubts that any of you may have.i hope that these rankings serve the purpose of promoting a healthy competition among states, the kind which leads to a race to the top, where each state adopts the best practices of others rather than a race to the bottom, where each states continuously demands concessions from the centre. a race to the top among states is what india needs to develop at a faster pace. it will also put pressure on the centre to give up its lethargy.let me take this opportunity to welcome you all once again. i am particularly grateful to the chief ministers, all winners and performers, who have joined us in our endeavour to make the india today state of the states report a blueprint for effective governance in india.thank you.session: can corruption be cured?petroleum minister s. jaipal reddygod is omnipresent so is corruptioncorruption should be cured substantially if not fully, says reddyour government has adapted 5-pronged strategy: strong lokpal bill, judiciary bill, public interest and disclosure (whistleblower) protection bill, public procurement bill are among the strategies.aadhar (uid) scheme is a very ambitious project.no party can say they are clean.uttarakhand chief minister b.c. khandurianna hazare showed us that corruption can be challenged and fought with.we passed the uttarakhand lokayukta bill not in 43 years but 43 days.all ministers including cm is under lokayukta.lokayukta is independent of government.he can initiate prosecution which is done by special courts. investigation should be completed in maximum 1 year.it has a provision of minimum 6 months imprisonment and a maximum 10 years imprisonment.maximum 1 year investigation by lokayukta and 1 year by special court.haryana industries minister randeep surjewala.there should be an institutional attack on corruption.we should use technology to defeat corruption.values have changed when one compares between generations of jaipal reddy and mine.as long as we have intent to cure corruption, we can attack it.during question and answer session, khanduri says the government has done too little, too late on corruption.session: do states get their financial due from the centre?the

2012-12-25,"in politics, 2013 will be a year for new found convictions to be tested and to be pursued","nothing epitomises the facile nature of popular journalism more tellingly than the template renderings of the mandatory yearend wrap-ups. the outgoing year is invariably proclaimed to have been a grim, crisis-ridden one, perhaps even the worst imaginable since the invention of google and wikipedia.and like those happy holiday cards that clutter the inbox these days, hope is also expressed that the sun will shine brightly for the next 365 days beginning from january 1.maybe it was the audacious departure from sheer predictability that attracted me to this week's editorial in the spectator, the magazine that panders to the quirky interests of right-wing, anglophile aesthetes. ""it may not feel like it,"" the weekly proclaimed grandly, "" but 2012 has been the greatest year in the history of the world."" since popular journalism is also all about holding reader interest for three minutes, this line is magnetic. ""never,"" it goes on, ""has there been less hunger, less disease or more prosperity.the west remains in the economic doldrums, but most developing countries are charging ahead, and people are being lifted out of poverty at the fastest rate ever recorded. the death toll inflicted by war and natural disasters is also mercifully low."" then follows the clincher, ""we are living in a golden age."" i don't know if the two sardars in blue turbans and the chettiar who preside over india's economic destiny are inclined to waste their time on a supercilious journalism, but they may well be reassured that the emergence of 5 per cent gdp growth as the new normal in india is envied in the old mother country.aspiring indiatragically, this enlightenment doesn't seem to be shared by the political establishment in a country where golden age persists in being translated as ram rajya - a state of being so vividly illustrated by amar chitra katha comics. railing against the emerging 'mall culture' and invoking the earthy wisdom of the indian farmer who doesn't need walmart to indoctrinate them about modern agricultural practices may be the fashionable thing to do. but, as the passage of 2012 clearly suggested, indians do care about the symbols of modernity. and this includes a robust gdp growth through which india's 'potential' moves to become india's reality.in hindsight, 2012 is the year when the post-1991, liberalised generation came of age. two delhi-centric events reflected the change. first, there was the anna hazare -inspired upsurge. this mass outpouring of emotion against the politically sponsored corrupt didn't happen because young indians suddenly realised the virtues of the mahatma's yearning for a moral polity. the motivation behind the protests was born of the conviction that corruption is an impediment to growth, efficiency and, most important, a merit-driven society.the message for 2012 for the political class is its growing vulnerability and alienation from the concerns of a generation far more aware, globalised and aspirational than thier parents.the revulsion was against a political elite that empowered itself by siphoning funds from the state exchequer. the protests were against the politics of privilege and the born-to-rule arrogance of hereditary politics.the second explosion that has unnerved the political elite is ostensibly centred on the brutal gangrape of a young physiotherapist in delhi. like the anna hazare protests, the candle marches around india gate and the dharnas outside the homes of politicians were not the product of careful mobilisation, the gathering of women and youth was completely spontaneous.politics of protestson the face of it, the protests were against the bestial behaviour of men who imagined that women who were out at night were 'asking for it'. the delhi protests replicated the anger felt by citizens of kolkata, guwahati and other cities over similar incidents.the moral dimension of the anna hazare movement was overwhelmed by the underlying political message.but like in the anna protests, the moral dimension of the protests was overwhelmed by the underlying political message, the profound anger against a state that neglected its obligations to the citizen in favour of special treatment of the political elite.the big message of 2012 for the political class is its growing vulnerability and alienation from the concerns of an emerging generation who are far more aware, globalised and aspirational than their parents' generation.take the outrage against the arrest of a hapless professor for circulating a pretty innocuous cartoon targeting mamata banerjee.or the case of the two girls in maharashtra who had cases slapped against them for questioning the iconic status of balasaheb thackeray.the preposterous behaviour of the authorities didn't imply that india was heading for another emergency where all anti-government and contrarian voices were disallowed. what was significant was that there are enough indians who want to extend the boundaries of personal liberty and are unwilling to countenance attempts to roll back the frontiers of personal freedom. the right of insolence has struck a chord in a society where deferential conduct has traditionally characterised the citizen's sattitude towards authority. and, it has happened outside the parameters of organised institutional politics.this is not to suggest that conventional democratic politics is on the cusp of being overshadowed by a neo-communitarianism based on people's power. far from it. many local elections took place in 2012 and in all of them voter participation increased significantly. nor is it the case that there was a sharp increase in support for candidates who proffered 'alternative' grassroots politics.in the largest state of uttar pradesh, the electorate reposed faith in a political party whose reputation was far from wholesome.in himachal pradesh, the people voted for a party led by a slightly inchoate 78-year-old raja who had to resign from the union cabinet following corruption charges. in gujarat, people voted in a bjp government for the fifth consecutive time.ephemeral outragesceptics may well have a point when they claim that popular, anti-political outrage is ephemeral and, in too many cases, driven by a cynical media.they may also be right in suggesting that the 'new politics' that the likes of arvind kejriwal are promoting and are likely to remain confined to a creamy layer. yet, there is a danger in disregarding the impulses that are driving the disgust for the political order.in 2012, the indian economy hasn't been at its best. manufacturing output has been sluggish and the services sector is hamstrung by the hiccups in western capitalism.middle class fights to live its dreamsthe slowdown has meant that opportunities have shrunk and standards of living have been affected by the government's mismanagement of macroeconomics.yet, ironically, and unlike the west where economic slowdown has been complemented by a mood of doom and gloom, expectations and aspirations in india are soaring. rarely before has india witnessed such a focused drive of people, cutting across social boundaries, to better themselves.some people expect the betterment to come as a consequence of government assistance - hence the frenzied desire of the congress to create an aadhar architecture of entitlements. others, however, merely look upon the government to cater to civic interests and capacity building - in other words, create an environment to facilitate selfimprovement.idea called modiin the coming months and years, politics in india may well come to be over these conflicting versions of aspiration management.perhaps that is why inordinate significance is being attached to 2012's final great event, the emerging clamour for the anointment of narendra modi as the challenger to rahul gandhi, the designated heir-apparent of the congress.such a development may have seemed unimaginable a few years ago when politics was still firmly cast in the mould of caste, community and pedigree. yet, in a curious sort of way, modi's appeal outside gujarat stems from very different impulses.for a significant chunk of india's below-35s who dote on technology, who are fiercely patriotic without carrying the baggage of anti-westernisation and are inclined to view politics and the political class with a largish measure of loathing, modi is actually a deeply antiestablishment figure, a rebel who is not a revolutionary.the gujarat chief minister may have cut his political teeth as a full-timer for an organisation that worships the idea of austere nationalism. but somewhere along the way he has acquired the image of a pugnacious moderniser and a man who is unafraid of taking on the country's entrenched establishment (including that of his own party) in pursuance of a modernist, technology-driven dream.in contrast to rahul gandhi who is an inheritance, modi is an idea.modi, however, is also an idea that, to succeed, must strike roots all over a country in different stages of economic evolution. as of now, modi can be said to epitomise a large chunk of the india that thinks big, dreams big and is exasperated by the political obstacles to india achieving greatness. but what about the india where dreams and aspirations are modest and curtailed by absolute deprivation? will a version of dabangg, starring the gujarat cm, arouse the same passions in palamau district as it does in surat? or will people reconcile themselves to dynastic rule as preordained? the politics of 2012 is marked by astonishing tentativeness. in the next year, india will again begin its journey to discover certitudes.but who knows, many new-found convictions may well appear to those writing the yearenders of 2014 or 2015 to have been mere passing fancies.trends have a disconcerting habit of being derailed by events.- the

2013-02-13,gehlot government couldn't walk four steps in four years. the next leads to exit: vasundhara raje,"on february 8, vasundhara raje took over as the president of rajasthan bharatiya janata party after a hard bargain with the high command. she was already leader of the opposition, a post which she was appointed to in 2008, removed from in 2009 and then reappointed in 2011. it was then bjp chief rajnath singh who had conveyed her parliamentary board's decision to remove her after two successive defeats in assembly and general elections in 2009, which she reluctantly accepted, and in 2013, she was brought back as the new state chief. ""he is our senior leader too and has only spoken well about me. so how can there be any trouble with him?"" raje told india today on being asked if she anticipated any problem in working with current party president rajnath singh now.as a president, raje has been quick to make amends. she gets a large authority in deciding who will contest assembly elections in december. there are many in the queue in anticipating a victory for the party. ""yes, we have many strong candidates around and we will work out a strategy for assembly, general elections and even local bodies and panchyati raj to evolve the leadership,"" she says on whether denial of tickets to many would result in a revolt against her thus harming the party.gulab chand kataria had led dissidents backed by rashtriya swayamsewak sangh which wanted him to head the organisation, but he settled as the leader of the opposition as there was no alternative to raje's popularity. raje extracted a price for it rejecting suggestions that party evolved a collective leadership where she was a star campaigner without any role in strategy and distribution of tickets. raje reminded the high command how she had agreed to it in 2003, but the same group of dissidents then went out to dislodge her by publicly boycotting cabinet meetings and embarrassing her to give the congress ammunition against her. when the high command bent a little, she moved two steps to please kataria.she entered rajasthan on february 7 and held a grand road show giving more importance to kataria at each of a hundred stops than any of her loyalists en route till she reached jaipur in a procession of a few thousand vehicles, covering 200 kilometers in 13 hours. kataria responded by lauding her for her popularity. this leaves some of her opponents in the party who have little base, like ghanshyam tiwari, deputy leader of the opposition, disappointed. he says he was no longer keen on continuing as the deputy of kataria. still, raje has given a slogan: ""ekjut bhajapa, congress laapata. (bjp united, congress finished)."" in all this, chief minister ashok gehlot (congress) is shaken with her grand arrival and a successful rally at moondwa in nagaur district, which is a jat heartland. gehlot knows that only raje can defeat him and so he has been targeting her mercilessly below the belt in the hope bjp and her opponents won't let her lead. she had handed a humiliating defeat to him in 2003. gehlot had very little role to play in her loss in 2008 as his rival c.p. joshi, now union minister for surface transport, was leading the congress charge. gehlot wasn't even leader of the opposition. the bjp's near united show has frustrated his strategy and he immediately organised a road show in nagaur city on february 10 where he targeted her alone. raje has ignored his remarks as she has been doing often. however, in her first interview given to india today assistant editor rohit parihar after becoming president, she promises a better government, shrugs off gehlot's challenge and tries to put infighting within the party on the backburner.q. you have a few opponents like ghanshyam tiwari, who will create problems for you. will the high command discipline them?a. i have no opponent in the bjp. without workers, any party is like fish without water. and without them, i will be lifeless. the bjp uses love and cultured manner to discipline anyone. q. chief minister ashok gehlot alleges that your party failed to expose the congress government in the state? do you have enough time left to do it before elections?a. it is wrong to say that. it was his government which kept running away from the assembly sessions. for the first time ever in rajasthan's history, a united opposition met the president and the governor urging them to ensure that sessions are held, where we were the voice of angry people. gehlot government could not walk four steps in four years and people know it well.q. gehlot repeatedly says that you do not stay in rajasthan and remain silent on crucial issues?a. please ask gehlot who made a record...or is it a world record - i must check - by not speaking a single word in assembly when he was in the opposition between 2003 and 2008? i have participated in every session of the house, raised issues that concern people and travelled across the state. i know that he wears spectacles that do not allow him to see people and nor does he hear the voices of the opposition.q. do you have a soft heart towards gehlot? before 2003 elections, then as chief minister and even now, you have very rarely attacked him whereas he targets you below the belt?a. my focus was to pull out rajasthan from the list of backward and laid back states. experts and investors had started citing my state as a success story. my bringing up does not let me stoop so low to attack gehlot's personal life. it does not mean that we or people have given him a clean chit on lots of other issues. aaage aage dekhen hota hai kya (you just wait and watch).q. after your taking over, he has re-launched his attack saying but for his mercy, something like what happened to ex-cms of tamil nadu and haryana could have happened here too?a. what else can he say? for four years, he tried his best to do it but failed to find any wrong by me. the supreme court struck down his inquiry commission against me. he deputed many offices to scan thousands of files to search for a single wrong deed but he could not. he had even threatened to send officers doing good work under me to jail. by parroting a lie a hundred times, he can't make it a truth. he will work on conspiracies against me since elections are approaching but i do not care. q. where do you find corruption in gehlot government: at the grassroots level or at the top?a. at every level, there is an institutionalised corruption. it was never so in rajasthan. the corrupt are becoming extortionist in this government. our system will not let them go free. officers who are making money should worry now.q. there have been issues where gehlot accused you of wanting to build a hotel at jalmahal and wanting that most expensive plot of rajasthan at statue circle?a. but actual beneficiaries turned out to be companies with whom he has admitted family ties. ""jin mamlon mein ungli hum par uthate thae, unhi mein to sauda yeh karte rahe hein. (in all the cases, where they pointed fingers at us, there were deals they were making for themselves). you had exposed a few such cases in india today's ashok's money chakra. investigate and you will get more by same friendly companies.q. what is happening on the issue of corruption in 108 ambulance service that your party raised?a. we launched such an excellent ambulance service. gehlot replaced the service providers by those who are kin of senior congress leaders and a union minister. the conditions are further relaxed by officers to give the company benefits that go beyond the original contract. media keeps reporting about delay and corruption in this service. it hurts to see patients' sufferings and wasted money.q. what will be your issues in assembly elections: hindutva or gehlot's corruption and inefficiency?a. there is no dearth of issues. why should i reveal them right now? but the gehlot government has been a failure and we will highlight the sufferings of the masses for sure.q. the power in rajasthan has become very expensive with little generation added to what you had left. will it be an issue?a. only generation? the debt has risen to rs 60,000 crore from the negligible debt, which we had left. we gave residential power for 22 to 24 hours even in villages where today there is a scarcity despite it being very expensive. the theft is on rise negating all our good efforts. the union government and regulatory authorities have blasted the state for mismanagement in power many times. we would have been surplus in power had i been around. it would have been cheaper too.q. gehlot is bringing the metro to jaipur. will he get urban votes this time?a. delhi also has an underground metro. in his hurry to run the train before elections, he has come out with faulty planning and has spoiled city's heritage look by running it mostly above the ground. there are no parking spaces left for commuters. there have been accidents on the sites and reports of poor materials being used. people know this. i worry how i will correct such blunders. the congress government killed our mass rapid transport system too in a rush for metro.q. minorities are holding press conferences against him. isn't it unusual? how will you take them along?a. he instigates castes against each other. in gopalgarh, the gehlot government created a situation, which led to muslims being killed. in soorwal, police inspector phool mhammad was burnt alive. every now and then, there have been such instances of atrocities. how can they forgive the congress? when we were in power, every caste, religion including minorities got the same respect, opportunity and felt equally secure.q. what about women and law and order?a. women in jaipur are scared of wearing gold chains and mangal sutra because of increasing cases of chain snatching. girl are being dragged into vehicles and raped. those who resist are killed. i do not play politics on such issues but expect him to show determination and sensitivity.q. once you hit out at gehlot for the way he deliberately delayed action in bhanwri devi case leading to her murder and created situations that embarrassed scheduled castes, bishnois and jats.a. you have given answer in your question. whatever i said was out of deep anguish.q. gehlot's triumph card, as per his critics, will be his social sector schemes. he has ordered free medicine, free houses for bpl families, free delivery in hospitals, aadhar card. that you must worry about.a. please visit rural hospitals to find whether patients are getting effective medicines free? bpl families were to be given rs 45,000 in two installments to make a house. you can't make even a kitchen and a toilet in this amount. they built walls but have no money for roof. there are no women specialists in many towns and villages for deliveries. q. and aadhar card?a. they are doing it now what i did in 2007. i launched a financial inclusion scheme where bpl women were given biometric cards through which rs 1500 was to be transferred to their accounts directly. there was a medical health insurance for rs 30,000 for them. the benefits of other schemes were to be transferred to them directly. i had deposited money with the punjab national bank, but the congress government stayed it. lots of money remained held up in the bank for years without we getting even interest. he could have continued that and clubbed aadhar with this as i had a plan to extend it to all those who get subsidy or help.q. what will you do for state's development if you come to power?a. there are many things for villages, towns and cities. i'll reveal the roadmap at the right time. given the way gehlot has pulled the state down, i will have to work very hard but we will lead the country.q. how many seats will you get this time?a. this kahani (tale) of victory will be bigger than our record win in 2003.",0.05946972389136568,gehlot government ' walk four steps four years. next leads exit : vasundhara raje,"february 8 , vasundhara raje took president rajasthan bharatiya janata party hard bargain high command. already leader opposition , post appointed 2008 , removed 2009 reappointed 2011. bjp chief rajnath singh conveyed parliamentary board ' decision remove two successive defeats assembly general elections 2009 , reluctantly accepted , 2013 , brought back new state chief.

2013-02-25,leaked!!! the budget speech that chidambaram wanted to present,"satire in association with unreal times .madam speaker,i have the unenviable task of presenting an election year budget which means i will have to pander to populist sentiment while paying lip service to reformist impulses.let me start off by expressing gratitude to smt. sonia gandhi for notionally guiding me and dr. manmohan singh for his tacit support. i would also like to mention shri rahul gandhi for no reason in particular.overview of the economymadam, gdp growth in 2012-13 is expected to decelerate to 5%. inflation continues to remain above comfort levels, manufacturing actually contracted last quarter, job creation in the unorganized sector is zilch. we are very disturbed by these figures and will not take them lying down. i have asked the cso to recheck the figures.most of the blame for the economic malaise must of course be laid on exogenous factors beyond our control: political turmoil in the middle east, the giant tsunami off the coast of japan, mild tremors along the san andreas fault and the volcanic eruption in tahiti all in their own way undoubtedly contributed to the slowdown.there was not much to cheer about on the trade front either. with players like glenn maxwell getting sold for a million dollars during the ipl auction, it should not come as a surprise that the current account deficit took a turn for the worse this fiscal. my government is therefore considering a stiff import duty on purchase of middling foreign players in addition to gold to ease downward pressure on the rupee.governance reformexplicitly budget for corruptionso as to bolster the framework for transparency and accountability in governance, i propose to explicitly budget for corruption for the coming fiscal. accordingly, rs 5 lakh crore has been earmarked for purposes other than what they were intended for. so, every expenditure item, in addition to classification by scheme, function (social, economic services etc), and economic segment (capital or revenue), will also be categorized under 'leakage' or 'non-leakage'.just like the fiscal deficit, i propose to track such leakages from the consolidated fund of india as a fraction of the gdp and set rolling targets: 5% in fy14, 4.75% for fy15 and 4.5% for fy16.of course, we will not be anywhere closer to knowing who the beneficiaries of these leakages are but at least we'll know how much is leaking out.direct benefits transfer - hire dmk as nodal implementation agencymadam speaker, over the last one year, we have touted direct cash transfers as a game-changer. however, the roll out of the scheme has been less than satisfactory with low enrollment under aadhar and insufficient banking infrastructure in large swathes of rural india to process payments.i have therefore decided to fall back on traditional, tried and tested methods by replacing nandan with shri azhagiri of the dmk as head of the nodal agency to implement direct cash transfers on a war footing. shri azhagiri, tapping into his immense experience, will oversee the roll out of camps where wads of rs 500 notes will be handed out to beneficiaries on a first-come-first-serve basis.this simple and elegant solution, as you note, is self-selecting - only those desperate for cash will bother lining up in queues - and obviates the need for identity validation or fancy it platforms for e-payments.introduction of higher denomination noteswith persistent double-digit inflation, it has become increasingly cumbersome to conduct high-value transactions using wads of rs 500 and rs 1000 notes. in order to reduce such dead-weight transaction costs and improve liquidity in the high-end sector of the economy, the rbi has decided to introduce currency notes in denominations of rs 1, 50 and 100 crores into the economy.to cater to the interests of the salaried middle class, who have to spend long hours in front of atms to withdraw cash to make down payments on land purchase, we have decided to introduce notes in denominations of 1lakh as well.black paper on the white economythe white paper on curbing the black economy was very well received. buoyed by the feedback, we have decided to come out with a black paper on the white economy this year.committee to fix irctcof the many economic challenges confronting the nation, if i were to single out one, it would be this: the excruciating torture of trying to book a railway ticket through the irctc portal. indeed, solving this could be a bigger game-changer than the direct benefits transfer program. i, therefore, propose a committee headed by shri sam pitroda to study the problem and come up with a white paper.social welfaremadam, no union budget is complete unless we introduce a scheme named after shri rajiv gandhi. this year we propose not one but 3 schemes:- rajiv gandhi mahashatak yojana, which will distribute 100 bats to each bpl household to commemorate sachin's 100th 100 in the current fiscal- rajiv gandhi garibi hatao yojana, a scheme that will mount yet another assault on poverty (no guidelines regarding modalities of implementation since it will exist only on paper)- rajiv gandhi rajiv gandhi yojana (first scheme ever to be named twice after the late prime minister, this ambitious anti-poverty program aims to increase social welfare in a fuzzy manner that no one really comprehends)with these, the number of extant central schemes named after one of our tallest leaders now stands at 25, consuming nearly 10 per cent of gross budgetary support.therefore, in keeping with my commitment to streamlining expenditure and bolstering delivery mechanisms, i propose to set up a separate ministry called the ministry of rajiv gandhi schemes to oversee the implementation of these flagship programs.i have also directed the secretary for expenditure to categorise all schemes into the gandhi family (those named after indira, jawahar, rajiv) and non-gandhi family schemes just like plan and non-plan.kingfisher bailout yojanamadam, with kingisher airlines continuing to drown in debt, and renege on payments to not just creditors but staff and vendors as well, bailout of the company is no longer a sop to the aviation industry but a bona-fide social welfare program. i, therefore, propose a grant of rs 10,000 crore to kfa as part of our commitment to the aamaadmi.tax reformswith the idea to tax the super-rich so as to finance the poor being a non-starter, we have no option but to take recourse to deficit financing, which of course will contribute to inflation and crowding out.to avoid that scenario, i propose to tax social media activity. by collecting a cess on every tweet, re-tweet, share, like, poke, and other sundry social media activities, we hope to mop up an additional rs 1 lakh crore to finance our election year extravaganza. hear oye fm's filmi budget! also see: if srk presented budget 2013-14also see: if

2013-02-26,leaked!!! the budget speech that chidambaram wanted to present,"satire in association with unreal times .madam speaker,i have the unenviable task of presenting an election year budget which means i will have to pander to populist sentiment while paying lip service to reformist impulses.let me start off by expressing gratitude to smt. sonia gandhi for notionally guiding me and dr. manmohan singh for his tacit support. i would also like to mention shri rahul gandhi for no reason in particular.overview of the economymadam, gdp growth in 2012-13 is expected to decelerate to 5%. inflation continues to remain above comfort levels, manufacturing actually contracted last quarter, job creation in the unorganized sector is zilch. we are very disturbed by these figures and will not take them lying down. i have asked the cso to recheck the figures.most of the blame for the economic malaise must of course be laid on exogenous factors beyond our control: political turmoil in the middle east, the giant tsunami off the coast of japan, mild tremors along the san andreas fault and the volcanic eruption in tahiti all in their own way undoubtedly contributed to the slowdown.there was not much to cheer about on the trade front either. with players like glenn maxwell getting sold for a million dollars during the ipl auction, it should not come as a surprise that the current account deficit took a turn for the worse this fiscal. my government is therefore considering a stiff import duty on purchase of middling foreign players in addition to gold to ease downward pressure on the rupee.governance reformexplicitly budget for corruptionso as to bolster the framework for transparency and accountability in governance, i propose to explicitly budget for corruption for the coming fiscal. accordingly, rs 5 lakh crore has been earmarked for purposes other than what they were intended for. so, every expenditure item, in addition to classification by scheme, function (social, economic services etc), and economic segment (capital or revenue), will also be categorized under 'leakage' or 'non-leakage'.just like the fiscal deficit, i propose to track such leakages from the consolidated fund of india as a fraction of the gdp and set rolling targets: 5% in fy14, 4.75% for fy15 and 4.5% for fy16.of course, we will not be anywhere closer to knowing who the beneficiaries of these leakages are but at least we'll know how much is leaking out.direct benefits transfer - hire dmk as nodal implementation agencymadam speaker, over the last one year, we have touted direct cash transfers as a game-changer. however, the roll out of the scheme has been less than satisfactory with low enrollment under aadhar and insufficient banking infrastructure in large swathes of rural india to process payments.i have therefore decided to fall back on traditional, tried and tested methods by replacing nandan with shri azhagiri of the dmk as head of the nodal agency to implement direct cash transfers on a war footing. shri azhagiri, tapping into his immense experience, will oversee the roll out of camps where wads of rs 500 notes will be handed out to beneficiaries on a first-come-first-serve basis.this simple and elegant solution, as you note, is self-selecting - only those desperate for cash will bother lining up in queues - and obviates the need for identity validation or fancy it platforms for e-payments.introduction of higher denomination noteswith persistent double-digit inflation, it has become increasingly cumbersome to conduct high-value transactions using wads of rs 500 and rs 1000 notes. in order to reduce such dead-weight transaction costs and improve liquidity in the high-end sector of the economy, the rbi has decided to introduce currency notes in denominations of rs 1, 50 and 100 crores into the economy.to cater to the interests of the salaried middle class, who have to spend long hours in front of atms to withdraw cash to make down payments on land purchase, we have decided to introduce notes in denominations of 1lakh as well.black paper on the white economythe white paper on curbing the black economy was very well received. buoyed by the feedback, we have decided to come out with a black paper on the white economy this year.committee to fix irctcof the many economic challenges confronting the nation, if i were to single out one, it would be this: the excruciating torture of trying to book a railway ticket through the irctc portal. indeed, solving this could be a bigger game-changer than the direct benefits transfer program. i, therefore, propose a committee headed by shri sam pitroda to study the problem and come up with a white paper.social welfaremadam, no union budget is complete unless we introduce a scheme named after shri rajiv gandhi. this year we propose not one but 3 schemes:- rajiv gandhi mahashatak yojana, which will distribute 100 bats to each bpl household to commemorate sachin's 100th 100 in the current fiscal- rajiv gandhi garibi hatao yojana, a scheme that will mount yet another assault on poverty (no guidelines regarding modalities of implementation since it will exist only on paper)- rajiv gandhi rajiv gandhi yojana (first scheme ever to be named twice after the late prime minister, this ambitious anti-poverty program aims to increase social welfare in a fuzzy manner that no one really comprehends)with these, the number of extant central schemes named after one of our tallest leaders now stands at 25, consuming nearly 10 per cent of gross budgetary support.therefore, in keeping with my commitment to streamlining expenditure and bolstering delivery mechanisms, i propose to set up a separate ministry called the ministry of rajiv gandhi schemes to oversee the implementation of these flagship programs.i have also directed the secretary for expenditure to categorise all schemes into the gandhi family (those named after indira, jawahar, rajiv) and non-gandhi family schemes just like plan and non-plan.kingfisher bailout yojanamadam, with kingisher airlines continuing to drown in debt, and renege on payments to not just creditors but staff and vendors as well, bailout of the company is no longer a sop to the aviation industry but a bona-fide social welfare program. i, therefore, propose a grant of rs 10,000 crore to kfa as part of our commitment to the aamaadmi.tax reformswith the idea to tax the super-rich so as to finance the poor being a non-starter, we have no option but to take recourse to deficit financing, which of course will contribute to inflation and crowding out.to avoid that scenario, i propose to tax social media activity. by collecting a cess on every tweet, re-tweet, share, like, poke, and other sundry social media activities, we hope to mop up an additional rs 1 lakh crore to finance our election year extravaganza. hear oye fm's filmi budget! also see: if srk presented budget 2013-14also see: if

2014-01-27,full text of rahul gandhi's interview,"congress leader rahul gandhifor the first time, congress vice president and poll campaign chief rahul gandhi opens up to an elaborate sit down interview with a tv channel. for the first time after his political debut in 2004, rahul gandhi takes direct questions on wide range of subjects. in the biggest political interview, rahul was asked all the questions that india wanted answers from the gandhi scion. is he scared of a political face off against modi? what is his view of the 1984 sikh riots? was he a reluctant politician? and what are his views on multiple scams that upa 2 was affected by.the following are the transcripts of the 1 hour 20 minute long interview with rahul gandhi:part 1:headline points:on being asked on why this interview has taken so long, rahul denies any reluctance to communicate.rahul on not being pm candidate: announcing a pm without mps' consent not written in the constitution.on avoiding being named pm, rahul criticises those who do, says ""democracy is not about destroying processes.""rahul indirectly takes on bjp for naming pm candidate. says ""democracy is about non-arbitrary decisions, it is not about destroying processes""rahul on whether he's scared to take on modi: first understand me, and then you'll get an answer about what i'm scared of.rahul on avoiding faceoff with modi: i've seen my grandmother and father die, i'm not scared of anything.rahul on whether he fears losing to modi: i'm not scared of losing, i've lost those i loved, ""absolutely nothing i'm scared of.""rahul on not fearing loss to modi: like arjun from mahabharat, i see only one thing: changing the system.rahul on being asked about modi, says he's ""blind to everything else"" except changing the system.part 1:q: rahul, thank you very much. it's great to have you on frankly speaking show today. it's been 10 years as an mp for you, you fought your first election in 2004 & this is your first tv interview.a: it's not my first interview, but it's my first formal interview of this type.q: why has it taken so long?a: i have done a little media interaction, prior to this. i have done press conferences & spoken to the media. but mainly bulk of my focus has been on internal party work and that's where i have been concentrating, that is where most of my energy was going.q: or is that you have been reluctant to communicate more on one to one basis?a: not at all, i have had many many press conferences that you have seen. i don't have that issue.q: it's not that you wanted to avoid touching on difficult or tough issues.a: i like difficult to tough issues, i like dealing with them.q: now that this is your first detailed & long interview in 10 years, we have a lot of ground to cover. i have one request to you right at the start of the interview, let's be as specific as possible on the subjects we deal with today. do i have your agreement on that?a: yes, we will be specific but if i would like to sort of explain things in a broader fashion, i think that will okay with you.q: if i want to draw you back into specifics?a: you can draw me back as much as you want.q: rahul gandhi the first point is this; you have just avoided this whole question about whether you are open to pm's post. it seems to me rahul that you are avoiding a difficult contest.a: see, if you look at the speech i gave at aicc a few days back. the issue is basically how the prime minister in this country is chosen. the way the prime minister is chosen in this country is through the mps. our system chooses mps & mps elect prime minister. i said pretty clearly in my speech in aicc, that if the congress party so chooses & congress party wants me to do anything for them, i am happy to do that. it's respect for the process. in fact announcing your pm prior to an election, announcing your pm without asking the members of parliament, is not actually written in the constitution.q: you did that in 2009?a: no, we didn't.q: of course you did?a: what we did in 2009 was that we had an incumbent prime minister. prime minister won the election, he then went to parliament. the members of parliament decided that, that prime minister will continue, and there was actually a process where he was asked.q: but you named your prime ministerial candidate?a: we had an incumbent prime minister and there was no question of our changing him.q: see rahul we can go up and down on this question. the fact of the matter is this, who else will they choose, and who else will congress mps choose if not rahul gandhi?a: that is up to them right, but what one has to do and this is central to what i keep saying is that democracy is about respect of processes. democracy is about non-arbitrary decisions. democracy is about spreading decisions; it is not about destroying processes. there is a process in the constitution and that process says, and it is clearly written in the constitution, and it says members of parliament are to be elected by the population and members of parliament are to elect the prime minister. all i am doing is respecting that process.q: are you avoiding a direct face-off with narendra modi? is there a fear of loss rahul because this election is not looking good for the congress party from overall estimates? and the growing belief is that if rahul gandhi has not picked up the challenge officially that means that there is a fear of loss, he is avoiding a direct one on one battle with narendra modi, you must answer that?a: to understand that question you have to understand a little bit about who rahul gandhi is and what rahul gandhi's circumstances have been and if you delve into that you will get an answer to the question of what rahul gandhi is scared off and what he is not scared off. the real question is what i am doing sitting here, you are a journalist, when you were small you must have said to yourself i want to do something, you decided to become a journalist at some point, why did you do that?q: you are asking me the question.a: yes, i am asking you a question, it is a conversation.q: because i like and enjoy being a journalist, it is a professional challenge for me. my question is you avoiding a direct face-off with mr. narendra modi?a: i am going to answer the question but i just want to ask you, when you were young and thought of being a journalist what drove you?q: once i decided to become a journalist, i can't be half a journalist. once you have decided to get into politics and you are leading your party effectively, you can't be leading your party by half, so i'll throw the question, with respect, back to you, narendra modi is challenging you on a daily basis?a: you are not answering my question, but i will answer the question and that will give you some insight into how rahul gandhi thinks. for that i will have to expand a little bit about my growing up, how i grew up and the circumstances in which i grew up. what i saw when i was a child ,was my father, who was a pilot, and because of circumstances was thrown into the political system and all i saw when was small after my grandmother died was my father in constant-constant combat with the system in india and then i saw him die actually. in my life i have seen my grandmother die, i have seen my father die, i have seen my grandmother go to jail and i have actually been through a tremendous amount of pain as a child when these things happen to you, what i had to scared off i lost, there is absolutely nothing i am scared off. i have an aim, i have a clear aim in my mind and the aim is that i do not like what i see in indian politics, it is something that is inside my heart. it is like in our mythology when they talk about arjun, he only sees one thing, he does not see anything else, you asked me about mr. modi you ask me about anything and the thing that i see is that the system in this country needs to change, i don't see anything else and i am blind to everything else. i am blind because i saw people i love destroyed by the system. i am blind because the system everyday is unfair to our people, i ask you today, you come from assam and i am sure that you also in your work feel the unfairness of the system. the system everyday-everyday hurts people and i have felt the pain that the system can cause. i felt the pain with my father, i saw him every single day of his life, so the question of whether i am afraid of losing an election or whether i am afraid of mr. modi is not actually the point. i am here basically for one thing, i see tremendous energy in this country, i see more energy in this country than any other country, i see billions of youngsters and i see this energy is trapped.part 2:headline points:asked about modi, rahul says: ""i think we will defeat the bharatiya janata party in the next elections.""rahul criticises bjp for concentrating all power in modi's hands, says he ""fundamentally disagrees with that.""rahul says his philosophy fundamentally different from bjp, which concentrated power in modi's hands.rahul backs pm, says manmohan right in accusing modi of ""presiding over a mass massacre.""rahul backs pm charge against modi, says it's a fact that he ""presided over mass massacre in ahmedabad streets.""rahul now takes on modi directly, says ""gujarat (riots) happened, people died, modi was cm.""rahul's strongest ever attack on modi, says he was cm during riots, pm right in blaming him for massacre.part 2:q: can i draw you back to my question. i will go into those areas and i respect what you are telling me about your personal journey, it's not rahul, as if i lack empathy for what you are saying, in fact i am pretty sure many people do but my question to you is narendra modi calls you a shehzada, now let's be very specific rahul. narendra modi calls you a shehzada, a) what is your view of narendra modi b) are you afraid of losing to narendra modi, rahul please answer my question as specifically as you can?a: what rahul gandhi wants to do, is rahul gandhi and millions of youngsters in this country want to change the way the system in this country works. what rahul gandhi wants to do is empower the women in this country, wants to unleash the power of these women, i mean we talk about being a superpower.q: you are avoiding the question.a: no i am not avoiding the question.q: my question to you is, what is the congress vice president's view of the bjp prime ministerial candidatea: i think we will defeat the bjp in the next elections.q: and what is your view of bjp's prime ministerial candidate?a: the bjp has prime ministerial candidate, the bjp believes in concentration of power in the hands of one person, i fundamentally disagree with that, i believe in democracy, i believe in opening up the system. i believe in the rti, i believe in giving power to our people. we have fundamentally different philosophies.q: what is your view, would like to expound your views, your pm accuses narendra modi in his press conference of presiding over ""the mass massacre of innocent citizens on the streets of ahmedabad."" mr. rahul gandhi my question to you is this, do you agree with your pm when he says that?a: well, i mean what the prime minister is saying is a fact, gujarat happened, people died but the real issue as far i am concerned.q: how do you accuse mr. narendra modi of it?a: gujarat happened, people died. the real issue at hand here is.q: how is mr. modi responsible?a: he was cm when gujarat happened.q: the fact remains that narendra modi has been given a clean chit, in the gulbarg massacre case by the sit and the court mr. gandhi. my question to you is can the congress party sustain its attack on mr. narendra modi on this issue when he has been given the clean chit by the courts in the gujarat riots?a: the congress party and the bjp have two completely different philosophies, our attack on the bjp is based on the idea that this country needs to move forward democratically, it needs push democracy deeper into the country, it needs to push democracy into the villagers, it needs to give women democratic powers, it needs to give youngsters democratic powers. it is about opening the doors of the congress party, about empowering the youth.q: how is narendra modi responsible for the riots when the courts have given him a clean chit, politically your party's tact to criticise narendra modi and draw him into the gujarat riots?a: our political party is fighting an ideological battle against the bjp and let me draw out the two pillars- our party believes that women should be empowered, democracy should go to every house, that rti, and the mnrega paradigm should be further expanded. the bjp believes power should be extremely concentrated in this country, few people should run this country and the large mass of this country should have no voice.q: specifically speaking how is narendra modi, your party criticised him for the 2002 gujarat riots, and how can you do that when he has been given a clean chit in the gulbarg massacre by the sit of the court. it was challenged in the court, the court upheld the sit finding and therefore legally speaking mr. gandhi you cannot draw narendra modi into the gujarat riots, implicate him personally. do you believe that strategy of your party is fundamentally wrong?a: the strategy of the party is very simple. everything we have done over that last 5-10years, in fact if you look all the way back to the freedom movement, every single thing we have ever done is empower people. we empowered people in the freedom movement, we empowered farmers in the green revolution, and we empowered the citizens of india when we did the telecom revolution. we have empowered millions and millions of people through frankly the most powerful legislation that has ever taken place in this country called the rti- right to information. things that used to be closed, things that were in closed doors which nobody knew about.q: i will come to that but you haven't answered my question. gujarat riots is the question, your party has consistently wanted to put mr. narendra modi on the back foot on the gujarat riots, he says ""the court has given me clean chit"" and i am asking you today, is your party's argument about putting him on the back foot on gujarat is flawed given the ways the courts have looked at it.a: the pm has stated his position on the gujarat riots. the gujarat riots took place, people died, mr. narendra modi was in charge of gujarat at that point. i am bringing you to a real ideological battle that is taking place here. the real ideological battle that is taking place here and the one we are going to win and that has always been one in this country is the battle of empowering people in this country. of course there is your point of the gujarat riots and it is very important that people who have taken part in this kind of thing are brought to book. but the real issue at hand here is empowering the women of this country, giving them true power. we talk about india being a superpower we can only be half a superpower if our women are not empowered. what i want to do is going forward is basically focus on three things. focus on empowering our people, truly empowering our people, giving them democratic rights within the political party. i want youngsters who come in and really, really push democracy in the party. i want to empower them and i want to make india, together with everybody, taking everybody together i want to put india on the manufacturing map, i want to make this the centre of manufacturing in the world. i want to make this place at least as much as a manufacturing power as china.part 3:headline points:rahul answers a question on 1984 by praising sikhs, says he doesn't turn his anger against a community.rahul's response: i do not take my anger on 2 people who did something evil and overlay it

for it.""rahul draws distinction between gujarat riots of 2002 and anti sikh riots of 1984.rahul accuses narendra modi government further on riots, says modi govt was involved in the riots.congress govt in 1984 tried to stop the riots. modi government in gujarat was abetting the riots.in a dramatic charge against modi, rahul accuses him of ""actually abetting and pushing the riots further.""accusing modi of pushing riots further, rahul says ""large number of people"" saw gujarat government actively involved.rahul says he has been told that ""the gujarat administration was actively attacking minorities.""rahul gives congress govt clean chit for 1984, while accusing modi of pushing riots in gujarat further.part 3:q: you say that narendra modi was cm during the gujarat riots and the bjp was in power. the bjp was as much in power in gujarat during the riots as much as akhilesh is in power in up or for that matter the congress party was in power when the 1984 anti-sikh riots happened, now let me quote, you spoke in one of your speeches of the anger of your grandmothers death, i think it was campaign trail in rajasthan. you spoke about knowing the people who killed her and you spoke about anger and managing your own anger and quelling your own anger and drawing it into strength elsewhere. now that speech of yours became a subject of controversy with narendra modi posing a series a questions to you on 1984 and he said the following and i want to quote him and your categorical and specific response ""he's crying for the assassination of his grandmother but has he shed tears of those killed in the 1984 riots, i want to ask the shehzada and you remember mr. gandhi he's constantly deriding you by calling you a shehzada, whether your party kills sikhs in anger when your grandmother died, so following from this i have 2 questions, my first question; do you acknowledge the role of congressmen in the 1984 riots, b) will you apologise for the riots as your party demands an apology from modi for the gujarat riots?a: two things, in 1977 when my grandmother lost the election we went and lived ....and the people who came with my grandmother, those people who stood by my grandmother were sikhs. pretty much everyone had deserted my grandmother but the sikhs were standing with my grandmother. i think the sikhs are probably one of the industrious people in this country. i admire them; we have a pm who is a sikh. i don't have the same world view as my opposition. what those two people did to my grandmother, was two individuals, i don't turn around and take my anger which existed then, frankly, it doesn't exist now and brush it onto an entire community, that's just not me.q: i am sure you don't, my question is do you acknowledge the role of congress men in the 1984 riots because?a: i am coming to your question.q: i am sure you don't, my question is do you acknowledge the role of congress men in the 1984 riots because there must be justice. mr. gandhi there has to be finality, the gujarat riot cases have moved forward and many people have got justice, if i just compare that to the 1984 riots, you can look at the status and case history of what happened to mr. sajjan kumar, jagdish tytler, hkl bhagat, dharam das shastri and the one story that you hear there is these cases are endless, they go on for the longest period of time. i am asking you again, mr. gandhi before you seek an apology from modi would you apologise for the 1984 riots, would that be something that you consider?a: i do not take my anger which existed on 2 individuals who did something evil and wrong and overlay it on millions of people. i think that's criminal. did the sikh riots take place in delhi? absolutely. were they completely wrong? absolutely.q: were congressmen involved?a: did innocent people die? absolutely.q: were congressmen involved?a: some congress men were probably involved.q: has justice been delivered to them?a: there is a legal process through which they have gone through.q: you admit some congressmen were probably involved.a: some congressmen have been punished for it.q: in that case, why don't you apologise for the 1984 riots? the congressmen who you are talking about are still fighting their cases and in 2009 if i am not mistaken jagdish tytler, mr. rahul gandhi. was going to get nominated as a congress candidate, it was only following the media furore that his nomination was taken back. mr. gandhi i am asking you this question in all seriousness do you feel that congressmen were involved and 2) do you believe if you apologise for the riots there will be finality?a: the fact of the matter is that innocent people died in 1984 and innocent people dying is a horrible thing and should not happen. the difference between gujarat and 1984 was that the government of gujarat was involved in the riotsq: how do you say thata: i mean....q: the cm of gujarat has been given a clean chit by the courts.a: the difference between the 84 riots and the riots in gujarat was that in 1984 the government was trying to stop the riots. i remember, i was a child then, i remember the government was doing everything it could to stop the riots. in gujarat the opposite was the case. the government in gujarat was actually abetting and pushing the riots further. so there is a huge difference between the two things, saying that innocent people dying is absolutely wrong.q: explain that. government of gujarat was aiding and abetting the riots is what you just said, explain that?a: i mean it's not me...it's the large number of people who were there, large number of people who saw actively the government of gujarat being involved in the riots.q: you will keep that line despite the cm getting a clean chit form the courts?a: i mean, people saw it. i am not the person who saw it, your colleague saw it. your colleagues told me.q: they saw the riots?a: the saw the administration actively attacking minorities.q: what are you saying? can you explain?a: i am saying that there was difference between the 1984 riots and the riots in gujarat. the difference was that the government in 1984 was trying to stop the riots, trying to stop the killing whereas the government in gujarat was allowing the riots to happen.q: if the government in delhi and in the center was trying to stop the riots in 1984, then tell me, how is it possible that sajjan kumar was named in fir's on the grounds of inciting violence in outer delhi leading to the murder of sikhs. the status of the case is known. how is jagdish tytler, accused of inciting the mob in pulbangash leading to murder and rioting in the area. how is the late hkl bhagat accused of inciting violence. and you know that a plea in the delhi court was closed after his death. how did these congress leaders do what they did allegedly, if the government was so strongly and proactively acting against the riots?a: there is a process. see there is a legal process. and that process is on. okay.q: there was an sit finding. it was challenged by zakia jafri. it went up there and the courts upheld what the sit found. are you questioning the wisdom of the courts mr. gandhi?a: look. all i'm saying, all i'm saying is that there is a difference between the 1984 riots and the gujarat riots. the simple difference is that in 1984 the government was not involved in the massacre of people. in gujarat it was. the question is why do these kind of things take place. why is it that the gujarat riots took place? the gujarat riots took place frankly because of the way our system is structured, because of the fact that people do not have a voice in the system. and what i want to do. and i have said it and i will say it again. what i want to do is question the fundamentals over here. what i want to do is ask a couple of questions. i want to ask why candidates that are chosen in every single party are chosen by a tiny number of people. i want to ask why women have to be scared to go out on the street. i want to ask these questions. these are fundamental questions.part 4:headline points:simple difference was that in 1984 the government was not involved in the massacre. in gujarat it was.rahul accuses modi government once again of directly aiding and abetting the communal riots.asked if he will apologise for 1984, rahul says: ""i wasn't involved in the riots at all. it wasn't that i was part of it.""rahul says that he agrees with bringing political parties under rti, if there is unanimity.rahul on bringing political parties under the rti: more openness the better, bring a law in parliament on it.rahul in response to putting congress under rti: press does not have rti, judiciary does not have rti.rahul's final position: happy to have a discussion on bringing political parties under the rti.rahul on charge of protecting chavan: i'm sorry but congress has taken action on every issue of corruption.rahul on charge of protecting chavan: i made my position absolutely clear in a press conference.part 4:q: i appreciate that you believe in transparency. i'll move away from gujarat but i must say that i have not found this comparison between 1984 riots and 2002 riots that they are two different cases. i can't take this at face value mr. gandhi. the reason for this is because in both cases the government, the accusation is that the government could have done a little bit more. but at the same time i want you to, once more if you can substantiate. you stand by what you said, that the chief minister and the government of gujarat played a role in abetting the riots? you stand by what you said?a: all i'm saying is there is a difference between the 1984 riots and the gujarat riots. the difference is that the government of the day in 1984 was not aiding and abetting the riots. that is all i'm saying.q: so you don't need to apologise for the '84 riots. if someone seeks an apology from you, will you give it? your prime minister has apologised for the riots. expressed deep regret. will you do the same?a: first of all i wasn't involved in the riots at all. it wasn't that i was part of it.q: on behalf of you party.a: i think that riots, as all riots, were a horrible event. frankly i was not in operation in the congress party.q: mr. gandhi let's move on to the rti. which is the single biggest legislation to combat corruption. which you said in your speech at the aicc that was something that you were speaking about. now, i find it ironical that a party which has 90.38% of its funds from cash between 2008 and 2012. 89.11% of its money comes from unaccounted sources, unnamed sourced. why would you not say charity begins at home? and let us put the congress party and its funds under the scanner of the rti. why would you not bring the same freshness of perspective in this case as you did when you dealt with the issue of the ordinance?a: i think that political parties should be under rti if political parties feel, and it's a law that has to be passed in parliament. if political parties unanimously feel that that should be the case then it should be the case.q: what was your view? what will be your view on it?a: my position is that the more openness the better.q: so your own personal view is that your political parties should be under rti?a: see the issue is this. laws in this country are passed by parliament. what one needs to do is pass a law in parliament that brings rti in the political party. i have a personal view on it but you have to take that view through parliament. i have a view also for example on the six bills that are sitting in parliament.q: i'll come to that. but my question is on the rti. i want your view on it. you are a very influential politician. you have demonstrated some of your actions in the past that what you say and do can influence the decisions in government and in parliament. so my question to you is very significant. you said, in the aicc you said we enacted this revolutionary law to hand you power knowing fully well that it would place our own government under severe scrutiny. i agree with you. what about placing your own party under scrutiny? are you open to that?a: i am the first person who has been saying over the last five years, talking about transparency in the party. i have made the youth congress and the nsui fully elected bodies. i have spoken about the six bills in parliament. i have spoken about the lokpal bill and i have pushed the lokpal bill. i was involved in the rti. we worked together to bring the rti. so as far as transparency in the political party is concerned i am absolutely for transparency. there are questions about the rti that need to be discussed and thought through. the real question is that our system is based on different pillars. and the question is which ones of these pillars should have rti. because, if you only put rti into one pillar and you don't have rti in for example the judiciary and the press and in other areas then you might create an imbalance. am i for opening up? am i for bringing rti into as many places possible? absolutely. am i for creating an imbalance and weakening the legislative structures of this country. no i am not.q: how does putting political parties under the purview of the right to information act, how does that actually weaken the legislative process? it brings in transparency.a: it brings in transparency but it changes the balance of power.q: how?a: because the judiciary does not come under rti. the press does not have rti. other components of the system do not have rti.q: the press does not rule the country.a: no it doesn't. okay. the judiciary does not have rti. so you have to have a complete thinking. so if you want to bring rti. if you want to deepen rti, you have to think about it in a composite manner. you cannot just say, 'okay let's put rti here, put rti here'. you have to have a strategy to put rti and open the system together. and as far as opening the system is concerned.q: but you are willing to let a discussion happen on brining political parties under rti?a: of course i am.q: you're not opposed to that.a: no i am not opposed to any discussion, ever.q: on this specific subject.a: on all subjects. one has to take care that one is not creating imbalances in the system. and that's something that one has to discuss.q: mr. gandhi do i sense that you are almost committing yourself and then pulled back.a: no, no, no. i have said that i am happy to have a discussion.q: you're happy to have a discussion?a: of course.q: on bringing political parties under rti?a: absolutely.q: mr. gandhi.a: but let me just go back and let me give you... let me go further than that. the central question in all this is who chooses political candidates and how? the central issue in all this is what is the power of the member of parliament, the power of the mla and the power of the pradhan in political system? if you look at the legislative power of a member of parliament, you look at the legislative power of an mla today and you look at the role he plays in parliament and the role he plays in the assembly. he doesn't actually make laws. he presses buttons. go to a state like uttar pradesh and you look at actually the law making, the law making done by the mlas, it's extremely limited. you can't talk about bringing people into politics. you can't talk about opening up the system until you start to empower these people.q: was it part of the empowerment of people that ashok chavan was protected in the adarsh scam despite the fact that the judicial commission actually said that he was involved in a quid pro quo? a chief minister, an ex chief minister forced to go because of one of the biggest scams. which was by the way mr. rahul gandhi played out greatly on the channel. is he being protected? the cbi is not getting permission to prosecute him. you can say all this mr. rahul gandhi about the legislative framework to fight corruption. but my question to you is more fundamental. you have not shown the political will to use your tremendous influence to ensure that ashok chavan faces justice. you said a little bit and you moved back. why are you still protecting ashok chavan.a: i'm sorry the congress party wherever we have had issues of corruption we have taken action. on every front. we are the ones who brought the rti which is the single biggest weapon against corruption. and we got it ourselves. we are the ones who delivered rti to this country.q: your maharashtra cabinet rejected the judicial commission report on adarsh. and after that the governor refused to give prosecution to go against ashok chavan. none of this was part of the empowerment of the people. you said you're not for it. after that in some kind of tardy, if i may say so, partial acceptance of the report. the bureaucrats are blamed and each and every politician including mr. ashok chavan gets away. i want to ask you mr. rahul gandhi. you said you will not compromise. you will not make small compromises. how big a compromise was it for you to continue to protect mr. ashok chavan. why are you protecting ashok chavan?a: i made my position on ashok chavan absolutely clear. i made it front of a press conference. i made it absolutely clear exactly what i thought about that issue. let me again go back to the issue at hand. the issue at hand is bringing in youngsters into the political system. opening the doors.q: the chief minister did a sort of partial acceptance which basically means bureaucrats are faulted in the report. they are penalised. indicted politicians get away. mr. rahul gandhi i am asking you this because you've come up on the issue. do you have the political conviction to push this through. what will you say to the people watching this interview today, who will say, 'you know what, you said it' but you're not taking responsibility. the man still gets away scot-free. why should a bureaucrat be punished and a congress politician be let off?a: what i will say is that in the congress party anybody who does any act of corruption will be taken up and punished.q: what about ashok chavan?a: every single person.q: but he has got away.a: what i will say is that there are six bills in parliament that are sitting there bring them in. pass them.q: but your words are not matching your actions mr. rahul gandhi. you're saying it but all the politicians they got away scot-free, including not just ashok chavan. there are several ncp ministers. all of whom tried to interfere and meddle in the process. they used the name of kargil mr. rahul gandhi to give themselves private profit. if you say this and you have the conviction why are you not following it through?a: i have made it absolutely crystal clear right in front of the press what i think about this issue.q: but nothing happened.a: what do you mean nothing happened?q: ashok chavan faces no action.a: absolutely not. what all i'm saying is that anybody, regardless of who he is, if there is any corruption by any congress person we will take action.q: would you like to see ashok chavan facing action?a: we have punished our own minister. we have put the most powerful bills in the parliament house. please get those bills passed. that's what i tell the opposition in this country.part 5: headline points:rahul on virbhadra corruption charge: there is a legal process, follow it and conclude it.rahul: we took action on corrupt ministers. lets talk about system being corrupt, not peripheral things.rahul says he knows that there is no case being followed against virbhadra singh, but says ""that is not my job.""rahul defends his silence on scams, says he had many conversations on the scams with the prime minister.rahul says he was reporting to the pm. says he made his views on scams ""abundantly clear to the pm.""part 5:q: i am giving you two examples. one ex chief minister and one a current chief minister. virbhadra singh. my question to you is we have papers which have shown that the chief minister takes money from a company which his government does business with. and he takes money. large amounts of money are put in. and then he says i just took the money as a personal loan because i wanted to do renovations in my palace. my question is mr. rahul gandhi. and this is really fundamental because you have taken a position on corruption of late. do you think it appropriate of another chief minister of a state to be deciding on the fate of a company, that he is revealed to have close links with? and by not speaking on it, because you've not spoken on it, aren't you missing on yet another opportunity to address the issue of corruption with virbhadra singh?a: as far as any corruption done, there is a legal process. and that legal process should be followed and concluded. as far as my personal view is concerned, anybody who is corrupt should be brought to book.q: was the legal process completed when a raja was asked to leave the cabinet?a: we took action against the dmk ministers.q: was the legal process completed when mr. kalmadi was asked to leave as secretary of the congress parliamentary committee?a: we took action on the corrupt ministers. we have passed a bill in parliament. the lokpal bill. the most powerful thing. we got you rti and we got six bills sitting in parliament house. we have to change the way the system works. we are always talking about peripheral things. we are never talking about the core reason this system is corrupt. the core reason the season is corrupt is that there is too much concentration of power in the system and people on the peripheries do not have power. the people on the streets do not have power. and that the reason that happens is that our political system, political parties are shut. we need to open the door of the political parties. we need to move, carry out more legislation like rti and we need to change the system.q: are you open to taking action on ashok chavan and virbhadra singh? have you seen the papers yourself? will you examine them mr. gandhi? will you examine it?a: anybody who is corrupt should be punished. i am not a judge. so if there is a legal process and there is a result of the legal process, absolutely they should be punished.q: there is no case being followed against mr. virbhadra singh.a: yes i know that but i am saying that it is not my job. my job is when i see issues of corruption, take action on it. that's what i do.q: well mr. gandhi now you see. the other question is, should you have spoken up much much earlier? you know you didn't. everyone wants to know today why you didn't speak up during 2g. why didn't you speak up during coalgate? why didn't you speak up? i think it was june 2010 that our channel broke the cwg scam and railgate. you could have spoken up. and you can't take the defence that you were not very actively there. you have for some time been effectively in-charge of the 2014 re-election campaign.a: my position was that i report to the prime minister. whatever i felt i had conversations with the prime minister. whatever i felt about the issues i made it abundantly clear to the prime minister. i was involved in the legislation, rti legislation. and now i have helped pass the lokpal bill. i bring you back. the real issue here is participation of people in politics. it is bringing youngsters into the political system, it's opening out the political system. that's where nobody wants to talk. everybody is perfectly happy with 500 people running the entire system in india. nobody, none of you want to raise that issue. the fundamental issue. how do we chose candidates?q: do you feel that you have undermined by remaining silent? i want to ask you this when the pawan bansal and ashwini kumar episode happened for six days the govt batted back, everyone said this is unacceptable. six days the parliament was washed out, do you feel in retrospect that you could have spoke out earlier, mr. gandhi please be frank with me on this.a: what i feel is that this country needs to look at the fundamental issues at hand, the fundamental political issue at hand is that our political system is controlled by too few people and we absolutely have to change the way our political system is structured, we have to change our political parties, we have to make them more transparent, we have to change the processes that we use to elect candidates, we have to empower women in the political parties, that is where the meat of the issue but i don't hear that discussion, i don't hear the discussion about how are we actually choosing that candidate, that is never the discussion.part 6: headline pointsrahul: their clout does not make them oblivious to scrutiny, but we have to open up the system.rahul on tying up with lalu despite corruption conviction: alliance with an idea not an individual.rahul on tying up with lalu despite corruption conviction: our alliance with a party not an individual (lalu).rahul: we are making alliances with parties on their views not with individuals (in context of corruption charges).rahul: prices are an issue, i made my views clear during the aicc session.rahul: its not that i have just woken up on prices. i have been working with the pm on prices.rahul to arnab: prices are a reality. i still have faith in the pm.part 6:q: so i am asking you how are you choosing ashok chavan? that is a discussion i am willing to have, how are you choosing virbhadra singh, they are elected representatives they hold clout, does their clout make them oblivious to public accountability and scrutiny?a: their clout doesn't make them oblivious, but the point here is the system is the system behind them that has no processes no systems and we just assume that thing is going to work. what we have to do is we have to open that up. we have to bring youngsters into that and that no-one is discussing.q: mr. gandhi a lot of people felt when you said that i will not make compromises; you have got a round of applause when you spoke up on the ordinance. there are many people have faulted you for your technique, they say you could have chosen a more discreet way. my question is will you make compromises, are you willing to make compromises for political purposes, alliances or convenience?a: my long term view is that we need to take the indian political system to a different place. we need to bring in youngsters and we need to move away from this concentration of power. unfortunately the political system today is at a particular place and i can't simply ignore the fact that the political system is at that place, so certainly there are points at which you might have to take a decision that you are not a 100% happy with but the long term idea for me is to transform the system, to bring in youngsters and make sure they are empowered.q: lalu prasad has been convicted on the 30th of september 2013 for the alleged fraudulent withdrawal of crores of rupees from the chaibasa treasury in the 90s, the case you are completely aware of. my question is will you make that compromise despite that case to enter into a political arrangement, because when you spoke on the ordinance there was also the backdrop of that case coming up, will you make that compromise?a: these decisions of the congress party are made by senior leaders.q: you are the boss.a: our alliance in bihar is with a political party with an idea not an individual, we are making alliance, and it is not certain that we are going to make an alliance, we are in process of talking to people and our alliance is with an idea, with a party, not an individual.q: if i were to take that further and challenge you that there is talk of a possible alliance with the dmk and lalu prasad, and if you are accused by your political opponents that he talks about not making compromises but he agrees to enter into convenient alliances with parties for short term gains, how will you justify yourself?a: we are fighting an election, we are going to win that election, there are our alliance partners, there is our alliance partner in maharashtra, and there is our alliance partner in bihar and jharkhand. we are making an alliance with their view not with an individual.q: leader of the party is lalu prasad, hence you are making an alliance with an individual?a: no, we are making an alliance with a political party.q: but these are not settled alliances yet but you are open to them?a: yes.q: mr. gandhi the other question is about price rise and you got a round of applause when you spoke about the lpg cylinders, you told the prime minister quite charmingly - that mr. pm please make things less difficult for households. but i am questioning your silence all these years, because in this period from 2004-2013 the wholesale price index of food goes up by 157%, vegetables by 350% and onions by 521%, you don't speak on that. when raj babbar says you can get food at 12 rupees a meal, you don't speak then , when rashid masood says you can get food at 5 rupees a meal you don't speak then, the accusation there is and the general feeling mr. rahul gandhi is that you have really woken up to the issue after the 4-0 drubbing in the last state election, do you concede that?a: no, i think women are the backbone of this country and women need to be empowered and i felt that price rise is an issue cylinders were a big issue, i went to kerala and i go a sense that women were concerned about that and i made that view clear to everybody in the aicc session.q: but you didn't intervene earlier?a: i have been working with the pm on the price rise issue, i have been in discussions with him and we have taken steps in our states, where we have called the chief ministers and we have taken steps where we have actually reduced the prices of vegetables in our states, so it is not that i just woke up, it is that i have been working on it systematically. but what i really feel that we need to start looking at empowering women, bringing them in and listening to them.q: did upa 2 let you down on prices?a: prices are a reality.q: did the govt let you down, when i look back at your comments i find a comment each time, in 2009, 2010, 2011 you had lot of faith in the pm...a: i still have faith in the pm he is our leader.q: does the govt's track record on prices not make your faith in the pm shake a little?a: we are working on prices, as i said we have spoken to our chief ministers and we have reduced prices in states where we are in power.q: so you have not woken up to it only because of political purposes?a: no.part 7: headline pointsrahul's first response on aap: there are things about how they have reached out to people, don't take that away from them.rahul: the congress felt we should give the aap a chance to prove

we win, they say im not involved, when we lose, i am the cause of it.rahul: its ridiculous to even ask questions about our motives behind supporting the aap.rahul: i didn't choose to be born in this family, i didn't sign up and say this is where id like to be born.rahul: i can either walk away or improve something. i am absolutely against concept of dynasty.rahul admits political dynasties exist in the congress because the system is closed.rahul on dynasty in politics: you can't say abracadabra and open the system by waving a wand.rahul defends himself against the charge that having 15 seats opened for direct candidate selection is too little.rahul: if you want me to show you my degree i can show you my degree.rahul on subramanian swamy's charge: i have given a sworn affidavit saying that

now, it'll get thick.rahul: the stuff i want to do is not done in 5 minutes, it is difficult work.rahul: i don't go to an election thinking, if we lose it's the end of the world.'rahul's response: unfairness makes my blood boil. that's at the heart of my politics.rahul: the ""power is poison"" remark shows i don't get driven by the desire for power.rahul: power per se, the thirst for power, the quest for power is not there in me.part 7:q: mr. gandhi what do you think of the aam admi party and why are your views constantly shifting on the aap, on the 8th of december after the loss you quite candidly spoke about traditional and non-traditional parties - non-traditional parties being those who have involved a lot of people. suddenly i find that now seem to be over critical of the aap, i presume you were talking of them when you said that there are people who can give haircuts to the bald, were you referring to them when you said parties who over market themselves, which parties were you talking about?a: the work that i have done in the congress party, the work that i have done in the youth congress and the work that i am going to do in the future is about bringing in youngsters into the party, strengthening processes, strengthening candidate selection process and strengthening policy processes. i made a comment about the aap where i said that there is something that we can learn from them and what i felt that we could learn from them is that they reached out to people in a particular way that was good, there are things that i don't think we should take away from them. i think we have fundamental strengths in the congress party and it is something that we have been working on for 3-4 years now and the real power of the congress party is the depth of the organization and you can't makes changes by destroying things.q: but in a recent interview mr. chidambaram said he felt the decision to give support to the aap was unnecessary and that the opinion was divided on this within the congress. having seen what you have seen in recent days and the chaos that followed in delhi, do you agree with that view? do you feel in retrospect that support to the aap is something you shouldn't have done? please be candid and frank with me on this.a: i think that as far as i am concerned that the aap won an election in delhi and we thought that we would assist themq: they got less seats than the bjp.a: we thought we would assist them, because our party felt we should give them a chance to prove themselves and one can see what they are doing and one can see exactly how much they have proved themselves.q: what is your view on arvind kejriwal?a: he is a leader of an opposition party like many others, what we have to do as the congress party and again in front of us is an election, what we have to do is 3 things. one is we have to transform ourselves, we have bring in youngsters, we have to give them space. two is we have to look at manufacturing, we have already set up the corridors north, south, east & west, how we can take the energy of the indian people and build a manufacturing superhouse... that is what i think the real issues are.q: are you using the aap to split the anti congress vote bank, to keep mr. modi out of powera: you are implying that we have brought the aap...q: i am not implying, there is a theory that the congress is propping up the aap and keeping them on an extended leash so that they somehow divide anti-congress vote bank. had the aap not been there the bjp would have done better and that experiment could be extended?a: i think you underestimate the power of the congress party, i don't think the congress party could even do that if they wanted to. the congress party is an extremely powerful system and all the congress party needs to do is bring in younger fresher faces in the election which is what we are going to do and we are going to win the election.q: you will win the election?a: yeah, i will win the electionq: you are confident about that?a: reasonably confidentq: and if you don't win do you take full responsibility for it ?a: if we don't win, i am the vp of the party of course i will take responsibility for it..q: if the aap goes against sheila dikshit in the cwg scam, will you continue to support them?a: i have already said that regardless of who the person is, if there is an issue of corruption the law should take its own course, that's my position.q: mr. gandhi i now want to understand a little bit on your personal side, my first question is that you have faced a lot of criticism, how do you handle criticism? people say he has his heart in the right place but is he a vote catcher, they pull out all the recent state elections up, delhi, mp, rajasthan and chhattisgarh, they say he has not despite playing an active role achieved considerable electoral success. they are questioning your vote winning ability, what would you say to them mr. gandhi?a: i would say when we win an election, when we won uttarakhand, himachal and when we won karnataka , i am not involved, when we lose an election i am the cause of it. but once again i think what the congress party need to do is tap its potential, what the congress party needs to do is change the way the its organisation is structured and look at changing the way politics in this country is structured, that is where i think we should head. questions about whether we have supported aap or not supported aap, frankly it is a ridiculous notion. it is ridiculous that we would construct the aap.q: you supported them, you gave them a lease of life so that they divide the anti congress votea: that ascribes huge power to the congress party, i think the congress party's strength comes when we open up when we bring in new people, that is historically been the case and that is what i want to do.q: mr. gandhi why do you keep invoking your family name. i have seen you refer, with respect, to your father and your grandmother repeatedly. now mr. gandhi some would say you should be careful of doing that because when you invoke your family and its achievement from the congress, you can be accused of touting your family background for your own political career and the second is you would be re-entrenching yourself in the role of being a dynast at a time when being a dynast is not seen to be a good thing? do you agree?a: i don't actually keep invoking my family name, i have mentioned my family name once or twice and then people report that. the real issue is that i didn't choose to be born in this family, i didn't sign up and say that i like to be born in this family it happened, so the choice in front of me is pretty simple i can either turn around and say okay i will just walk away from this thing and leave it alone or i can say i can try and improve something. pretty much every single thing i have done in my political career has been to bring in youngsters , has been to open up, has been to democratise. i am absolutely against the concept of dynasty, anybody who knows me knows that and understands that. but you are not going to wish away dynasty in a closed system, you have to open the system. dynasty or children of politicians becoming powerful happens in the bjp, it happens in the dmk, it happens in the sp, it happens in the congress party, it happens everywhere.q: then how are you different?a: you have to go into why it is happening.q: it is happening because dynasties are allowed to proliferate, it is because a scindia's son is a minister a deora's son is a minister a pilot's son is a minister. a pm's son is the congress vp that is dynasty. change is not happening at the top, you want change at the bottom. there are people out there who are saying that we want change at the top.a: the reason children of politicians keep getting repositioned is because the system is closed. you are not going to change that without opening the system, you are not going to open the system without having processes, the system is not going to open by waving a wand and saying abracadabra let us open the system. it is going to take time, it is going to take effort and it is going to take structure. that is the work that i do. that is the work i spent a whole bunch of my time doing that is the revolutionary work i have done in the iyc and the nsui that is the work we are doing when we talk of an open manifesto. that is the work we are doing when we talk of 15 parliamentary seats being chosen.q: only 15?a: absolutely, because one needs to set up the systems, if i was to suddenly launch into 543 seats directly elected by our people the system would explode. what i need to do is i need to set up an idea, test the idea, run the idea, if it makes sense, if it works then move it to the rest of the party. the step we have taken with those 15 primaries, we get that much of a little piece in the newspaper, but that is probably the biggest political step taken in this country. it is a huge-huge step and i think those are the types of questions one needs to ask, one doesn't ask them, one asks questions that don't actually reach to the heart of the issue. you are talking about india, we have had a 1 hour conversation here, you haven't asked me 1 question about how we are going to build this country, how we are going to take this country forward, you haven't asked me one question on how we are going to empower our people, you haven't asked me one question on what we are going to do for youngsters, you are not interested in that.q: that wrong mr. gandhi, if i wanted to know that i would hear a rahul gandhi speech, this is not a rahul gandhi speech this is a rahul gandhi interview. mr. gandhi i see that you have this knack of trying to throw the question back at me, i can only tell you mr. gandhi i am going to ask the questions. my question is how do you handle this. the other view is that you are a fragile person, you get affected by criticism. subramanian swamy has raised questions on your degrees, he says why does he claim he has an m.phil from cambridge; cambridge has no record of his thesis, you can't get an phil without a thesis, he says yes he went to harvard when rajiv gandhi was pm, someone gave 11 million dollars to harvard medical school, donors quota, once you enter harvard said to him we don't think you belong here, so he dropped out. he has questioned both your degrees, i want you today...a: were you in cambridge?q: i was at oxford .a: but you spent some time at cambridge?q: i was a visiting fellow at cambridge for a while.a: so where were you at cambridge?q: at sydney sussex college.a: so i was at trinity in cambridge, i spent a year there, i did my m.phil there.q: i want your response to subramanian swamy, how do you deal with this?a: you want me to show you my degree, i can show you my degreeq: would you like to show him your degree?a: he has probably seen my degree, i have given a sworn affidavit saying i that i have got these degrees, if i am lying on these affidavits let him take the legal process and solve it , what more do you want me to do.q: you challenge him.a: why should i challenge him?q: he's attacked you personally.a: he's been attacking my family for 40 years. why should i challenge him?q: does it affect you mr. gandhi when you are attacked at a personal level and how do you choose not to respond? how do you bury your head in the sand and say this is not happening? it's happening to you. you are being criticized.a: i respond by understanding why i'm being attacked. i'm being attacked because i'm doing things that are dangerous to the system. i'm being attacked because i'm asking questions that are dangerous to the system. and i'm not asking superficial questions. i'm not asking questions over here (pointing at the ceiling). i'm asking questions over there (pointing to the ground). and everybody understands that this fellow here is not just a superficial chap who talks. this fellow over here is thinking deeply and is thinking long term. that's why i'm attacked. i understand that. and frankly, attack me all you want. beat me to death. it's not going to stop me. i'm going to keep doing it. and i'm going to ask the questions that are relevant. and you know what, i have thousand people in the congress party, two thousand people in the party who are working on this stuff. they're not letting go. and i'm proud of them, they're not letting go. it doesn't matter. keep throwing stones at us. that's the point. the point is, people who are attacked in this system, the people who are actually attacked, are the ones fighting the system. you understand that? they're not the people who sit and ask, the superficial questions. they're the ones who're actually saying, let's do something about this system. they're the ones who are going deep into the system and understanding that this is the crux of it. and the crux of it, i've told you. the crux of it is how we choose candidates. the crux of it is how we make policies. that's the crux of it. the thing is, you don't like discussing it. you like discussing stuff that really, doesn't go to the core and i'm a serious politician. i'm not somebody who's here to get power, or make money or something. i'm somebody who's here, who's seen what the system does to people. i've seen, and i can give you example after example which is on my mind. but i'm not going to fight the superficial battle. i just am not. it's not interesting to me. i'm going to fight a battle. i'm going to fight a deep battle. i'm going to take the youngsters of this country and line them up. and i'm going to then take the system on. don't forget that.q: you don't have a thick skin, mr. rahul gandhi. politicians need to have a thick skin.a: if i don't have a thick skin right now, it'll get thick.q: you say you're a very serious politician. i assure you mr. gandhi, i'm a very serious journalist. therefore when i interview rahul gandhi, his first interview in 10 years, it's my responsibility to ask you specific questions. i'm glad you're taking them. my next question to you, and i have only two left. mr. gandhi, how much have you been affected by defeats and when we see, for example the visuals of priyanka holding you after the u.p election loss. that picture, almost in a protective manner that priyanka is holding you and you are walking away. you tell me what's happening in your mind out there. do you feel overwhelmed by loss, by defeat, because you've had quite a few off late? how have you dealt with it?a: it all depends on what you're trying to do. i told you that i'm here because i want to help use the energy of this country. i want to make this country powerful. i want to project the ideas of this country. to do that, i think there are basically 3 things one needs to do. one, is changing the way we do politics here. getting away from the superficialities, getting away from the small issues and moving deeper into the issues right. questioning the system, changing the system. things like rti, things like lokpal, things like how we choose our candidates. things like bringing youngsters into politics. second is empowering the women of this country. really bringing them into the system. really pushing them forward. and third is using the energy of the youth of this country. bringing in the type of jobs that they need. this stuff is not done in 5 minutes. this stuff is frankly not done in this type of discussions. this stuff is done through concentrated thinking and long term work. it's frankly difficult work, it's painful work. if we're thinking about that and thinking that's what we want to do, defeat just makes you stronger, it makes you want to do more. i don't go into an election thinking, if we lose it's the end of the world. we lose some elections, we win some elections. the real thing is that it's a heart thing. it's a soul thing. why are you here? i asked you that question, why am i sitting here? i'm sitting here because i feel with all my heart that we need to change the system here and not enough people are actually asking that question.q: mr. gandhi, my last question to you in the course of this interaction is this. your father was forced into politics by circumstances. in your case as well, when you said power is poison and spoke about how your mother sonia gandhi came and she cried. if i put that together with some of what you've said, it might reinforce the image of a reluctant prince. it's not my phrase, i'm sure you've heard this phrase used against you or to describe you a number of times. therefore mr. gandhi, the last question is this. had you not been a gandhi, would you have been in politics at all?a: if you look at my spirit, regardless of what i do, if i'd been born in india, regardless of what i do, i don't like unfairness. it just makes my blood boil. i don't like it. and in whatever i did, if i saw unfairness, i would stand up against it. that's the heart of my politics.q: if you were not a gandhi, would you be in politics? some say this is a circumstance thrust on you mr. gandhi. you've been thrust into this situation. you're trying to justify to yourself that you need to do it. heart of heart, are you a politician? had you not been a gandhi, would you be in politics?a: maybe you find me strange because...q: no, i don't find you strange.a: you sort of implied that, but maybe i look like an anomaly in the environment that i'm in. maybe that's what you're saying and frankly in a lot of ways, i am an anomaly in the environment that i'm in. the power is poison remark, and i tell this to my sister, i tell it to my mother and my mother tells it to me. i don't get driven by the desire for power. i'm just not driven by it. for me power is an instrument that can be used for certain things. but for me, it's not interesting to own it, to capture it or to hold it. maybe its because of my family circumstances and what happened to my family. power per se, the quest for power, the thirst for power is not there is me. what is there in me, is a desire, a strong desire to reduce the pain that people feel. to reduce the pain that people feel as a result of the system that is predatory. as a result of the system that need not be there. as a result of system that can change if we just start to ask the deeper question. and we stop asking the superficial questions. again, and maybe the seventh time i want to repeat it to you. what are those deeper questions? the deeper question is, why is power so concentrated in this country? why is it that the chief minister of a state has the access to any decision in the entire state? why is it that candidates are chosen in closed rooms? why is it that people do not have access to the candidates' decision? why is it that our policies are made behind closed doors by 5 or 6 people? why is it that the perspective of one minister is completely different from the one who is following him? what that's telling me is that we're not exactly taking the voice of the people into policy. we're not actually taking the voice of the people into the political system. you said about the aam aadmi party and you said, 'you criticised them and you praised them'. i liked what i saw as far as the representation, bringing in people, i thought that was an interesting concept. we've done that kind of stuff in the youth congress. that was interesting to me.q: isn't bringing in people when you disregard the legal process and sit on a protest outside rail bhavan and then you also force your decision and your minister is always right. you avoided my question on the aam aadmi party and i'm glad you've come to it. tell me mr. rahul gandhi, were you angry with sushil kumar shinde giving a face-saver to arvind kejriwal? it was reported. i didn't mean to go back to it, you brought it back. the accusation is that you're still doing deals with the aam aadmi party?a: what i liked about what i saw in the aam aadmi party was people coming into their system. i liked that. but what's different between us & them is that we have structure. we develop processes. that i didn't see much of.q: were you upset with mr. sushil kumar shinde for giving them a way out during the recent dharna? do you fell they should've been offered a face-saver?a: you're going back.q: yes, to specifics.a: it's not specifics. it's frankly superficialities.q: how is it superficial?a: it's completely superficial.q: this is the most relevant question.a: no it's not. whether mr. shinde should've apologised, whether he should've done this or done that is, it's a fact and it happened. but the real core issues in this election are, 1)are we going to head towards a democracy, towards deepening our democracy and towards opening up the system or are we going to head towards concentration of power? 2) are we going to head towards empowerment of women? are we going to be a half strong nation? be a half proud nation? or are we going to actually empower women? those are the questions. and you know, if you listen to the debate that's going on, about the elections, that's not the debate. there's nothing in the debate about how we're going to move forward on the rti paradigm. how we're going to move forward on the corruption paradigm. there's nothing in the debate about funding of political parties. there's nothing in the debate about how we're going to choose political candidates. there's nothing in the debate about how policies must be made. these are the fundamental things. these are the things that actually make an impact.q: you're you're avoiding a debate. will you have a debate with narendra modi if he agrees to a debate on any of these issues? my question is direct. if narendra modi says i'm willing to debate these issues...a: i'm debating these issues by building structures in the congress party that's going to transform it.q: why shouldn't there be a debate between the key political party candidates on all sides? let them talk. let them have a conversationa: you're more than welcome. you have to start that debate. as far as i'm concerned, the debate is taking place.q: i'm ready to start the debate. are you ready for it? then i can go and ask mr. narendra modi if he's ready for ita: you start the debate. but the real issue is doing this stuff. the real issue is doing this stuff in the party machine. the only people who are doing that, is us. and frankly, we can stick for it. we've just said that 15 constituencies in this country in the congress party are going to be chosen by primaries. no one said a word about it.q: of course, it's mentioned everywhere. it hasn't impressed too many people.a: but the discussion hasn't gone there. so all i'm saying is, as youngsters and as serious politicians, one has to ask the fundamental questions. the fundamental question this election is, are we going to open up the system? are we going to close the system? what is going to be the role of women going forward? how are we going to get jobs for youngsters in this country? you asked me a whole bunch of questions. you didn't ask me once on how we're going to get jobs for youngsters in this country. you didn't ask me once about what we're going to do for the women for this country. and i'm going to tell you what i think.q: but mr. rahul gandhi, if i was to do that, i would listen to a rahul gandhi speech as i said. this is an interview. i'm getting an opportunity to ask you specific questions. you called my specific questions superficial. i, with respect disagree. i feel my questions are specific and you need to answer the specific questions as specifically as possible.a: you're more than welcome to ask these questions. but let's also move the debate to a place where we're actually reaching towards fundamentals. what should be the role of women in this country? how can we enhance their role? how do we bring jobs to millions of people. for example, every single person who comes to me from abroad, japan, france, germany, america and tell me 'listen, we need an alternative to chinese manufacture'. we're very happy with what the chinese give us, but we need another port. there's global energy saying we want to move manufacturing to india. the congress party, the upa govt have built the corridors, we've built the north-south, east-west corridor. we built 3 times the roads the nda built. why are we not having a discussion on those topics?q: i asked you that question during the course of the interview. did upa govt let you down? because mr. rahul gandhi, when foreign investors want to invest in india, they want a clean investing environment. they don't want crony capitalism. they do not need scams. they do not need ministers who behave like govts exist on their rent. they do not need the a rajas and the aircel maxis scams. the climate mr. rahul gandhi has become vitiated with corruption. and therefore, the answer to that is and i really want you to address this. if you had spoken out earlier, and lets bring this interview to a finality. if you had spoken out on these issues earlier, perhaps today we would not be in a situation where india is not the preferred investment destination. you get my point?a: actually, the rti right, has basically changed the game in india. what it has done, is that it has basically opened up the structures. and what used to be hidden, can no longer be hidden. that's the bottom line. the bottom line is large number of corruption issues that were hidden, that nobody would have found out about, came out because of the rti. we did that. now please go to our opposition states, please go to their states and ask them if they have rti commissioners. the issue here is very simple. the issue is do you want an open system? do you want a system where these things are out in the open? or do you want a closed system where these things are hidden?q: i think we should have a debate mr. modia: the debate is taking place right nowq: the debate has to take place between individuals. my final question, mr. gandhi. will you be open to a debate between key candidates or representatives of the major parties? will you participate in such a debate if there were to be one?a: there is a national debate taking place right now. the national debate taking place right now is the following. there is the congress party that believes in openness, that believes in rti, that believes in panchayati raj, that believes in giving people power. and there is our opposition that believes in concentrated power. that's the debate that's taking place. that's what the election is all about. we fundamentally believe and the congress party has always believed that this country has to be ruled by its people.q: can you take back this election or have you lost this election before its begun? most of the surveys are saying congress party will be reduced to its lowest ever tally. what would you say to that, mr. rahul gandhi?a: this country has always been run & successfully when large numbers of people were involved in the decision making. historically, when you look at when this country has done well, it has done well when we have involved people.q: you know what modi says to that, he says you gave them 60 years. he says give me 60 months. he said that in u.p at gorakhpur when he spoke recently. i want you to respond to that.a: my response to that is that in the last 10 years, we gave the country the fastest economic growth its ever had. my response is that, we did more for opening up the system than any govt before us. my response is that we have completely changed the paradigm with our rights based development model. we have given mgnrega which has transformed the rural economy. we are talking about aadhar which is going to give money directly to the people. to just brush aside the idea that congress party has been in power for 60 years, we are growing at the rate at which we are growing because of the congress party.q: are you battle ready?a: battle ready, of course. we're going to win.q: mr. rahul

2014-10-30,i can get more investment than i can handle by just smoothening existing procedures: parrikar,"manohar parrikargoa chief minister manohar parrikar tells deputy editor sandeep unnithan how his state coped with the loss of revenues after the mining ban and the challenges of attracting quality investment into india's smallest state and denies speculation he is moving to delhi.q. how has goa benefitted from the new modi government?manohar parrikar: one major benefit is that we have seen a change in environment vis-a -vis the state issues, for example the earlier governement was hostile to the state and was therefore trying to needle into state issues by sabotaging placement of officers...not giving enough officers...we have still not recouped the gap, for example we had no inspector general of police, we had no dg for some time...so virtually police was virtually without appointment...things are now slowly changing and police officers are being posted. second, there is a hostility created by the upa ministers in the government bureaucracy itself...within the bureaucracy. you go to them with some good proposals. they don't bother. for eg in the mining case, after the shah commission report we temporarily banned mining, but the upa government went ahead and suspended all leases, just to show that they were one-up on the state government. now they were the one who had perpetrated it, but after that there was a continuous bottleneck in courts...trying to delay the matter, so that the state government is financially weak...now the atmosphere has changed by 60-70 per cent. two-third of the headache has gone away.q. how has that translated into gdp growth?manohar parrikar: not directly immediately but it can help the state government over a period of time to implement its policies. for eg, after the support from the environment ministry, the mining ministry and the government, we are now in position to renew the mining leases. orders have not been issued. policy decisions have been taken. certain leases have been approved by the director mines, who is the authority, but in principle clearance has to be sought from the government. the lease orders might come any moment. a dozen of them. not all of them will happen in one day...but it will take a few months.q. when do real benefits of these decisions come?manohar parrikar: real benefits will show in the next financial year.if i can realy start in the next 3-4 months that itself will add 15 per cent growth to the state. mind you we are already 10 per cent ahead...whatever gap was created by the halt of mining revenues has been sealed and we are now moving towards additional growth. this year, without mining, we will get 15-20 per cent growth. revenue growth. gdp will be 8-10 per cent. gdp growth will jump to 20 per cent. the gap caused by the loss of mining revenues have been filled by other sectors. agricultural gdp has jumped up. animal husbandry has grown, fisheries the gdp component. industrial growth is slowly returning. tourism is growing at 15-20 per cent. the degrowth of mining has been filled in by other sectors. now if mining returns, it will add substantially to our growth.q. how many investment proposals have you received in the past few months?manohar parrikar: we get too many. if i complete the proposals, i can complete all my state's capacity in just two years. i cannot compare myself with other (bigger) states like gujarat and maharashtra and their figures of rs 1 lakh crores investment...if i get rs 50,000 crore, it will be saturation for us.the problem is, i have to be choosy, at the same time, i have to ensure that those who are selected do not suffer because of hierarchical problems. that is what we have gone for the industrial promotion board. the law is in place, we are in the process of selecting the people. maybe in november 15 we should be in really position. a single window for all the statutory laws of the state government except the environment clearances. q. what are the proposals for rs 5000 crore you have received so far?manohar parrikar: for example good hotels, there are 8-10 hotel chains who are interested in putting up 3000 to 4000 additional five star and four star rooms.in industrial sector also, we are hamstrung by land mass.almost 35 lakh square meters of land in goa is stuck in special economic zones (sezs). that one land scam of the congress has caused this. we don't have enough land to give to industry.q. when will you clear the backlog of proposals?manohar parrikar: i'll put it like this, from december 2014 to december 2015, all proposals in the pipeline will materialise. the logic is, the concept is, once i give you the go-ahead, you will not be stuck up because a panchayat has not given you a clearance or a town-planning agency has not given you a permission...the only proposals not part of this board is housing, information technology, real estate proposals...otherwise, hotels can come, it parks can come, any other investment except real estate which is not part of the board.q.what have you done for education and health? how do you explain the steep fall in the teacher-pupil ratio?manohar parrikar: many government procedures have been cut down. grant in aid schools required a no objection certificate from the government to replace every retiring teacher. in 2013 we got this decision implemented. what i did was, if your school is well managed, we have categorised them into a, b, c,d...if you are a grade, for the next ten years, you don't have to come to me...you only have to intimate me by sending a letter...b grade, seven years...if you are c category...for five years you can go ahead...only d category. what happened with that, at one stroke, 500 no-objection certificates were releasedwe also ensured that at least two teachers are provided in a school. we are also in the process of taking in, more teachers for teaching primary level english. a primary level teacher is not able to handle thewe are taking 300 teachers for teaching english. there are many other initiatives. i intend to stress now on science subjects. the biggest problem is that we don't have enough teachers to teach science students.q. how many of the steps outlined in your economic vision document for goa in 2013 have you implemented so far?manohar parrikar: the most important decision was the creation of the investment promotion board. the ipb is headed by me as the chief minister, it comprises three ministers and three bureaucrats. it has law, plus the cm with the head.it has come into effect in october. we have proceeded to appoint the ceo. by november 10, i should be on board to receive applications and proposals.lots of people say i should go for a goa investment fair. i don't go for this because i know that in goa if we only make things smoother, i will get much more than i can handle...i don't need the hype of karnataka, gujarat or maharashtra.are you aware that despite the mining ban, i collected rs 900 crore through innovative measures through cess collections. i kept their confidence (of the mining industry).in 2012-13, the closure of mines was a shock. paying state government salaries would have been a problem. the loss of rs 900 crore for the state of goa is like 16 per cent of our revenue. now, it is my scheme to convince them.in the supreme court, i fought...i had the courage to tell them that it was my power and not theirs. they (the judiciary) have absorbed powers they don't have. sc can direct me, 'you spend this money to develop the forests' but it cannot order me to do it. there are institutional mechanisms created in the constitution to monitor. you spend this money on upgrading foests, planting greenery and ask controller forests to monitor it. give one copy to the supreme court. but you cannot appoint a cec and appoint three-four people to decide. then, why am i elected? i am also a constitutional body.q. there is a lot of speculation that you will move to delhi as defence minister.manohar parrikar: some senior person said that i should come to delhi as defence minister. i checked up, it was a senior leader who said that i should be brought in as defence minister. modi has never told me. only if modi tells me will i think about it. i have not applied my mind based on some rumor. i am happy here. if i am happy here?why should i think of something else? i told you so clearly that i have not been sounded by anybody...i understand the air of possibility. i understand that. but i don't want to play that game.q. but you will reach a point when you outgrow goa.manohar parrikar: i will cross that bridge when it comes.q. speaking of bridges, you have planned a third bridge over the mandovi?manohar parrikar: yes, this will be in between the two bridges that will directly connect north goa with south goa. two bridges will still connect to panjim. this third bridge will be a direct bridge linking ahead of panjim. the bridge is rs 405 crore at tender stage. it will change slightly.q. what about the second international airport for goa?manohar parrikar: the mopa airport is four years away. about nine months to get the contractor. we have issued the qualification.q. goa has done well on women and child health. what do you credit these improvements to?manohar parrikar: essentially by empowering women. we don't have to do much. goa has a unique schemes which no part of the country can implement. the laadli lakshmi scheme gives one lakh to a girl child when she turns 18 or when she gets married. the second is the 'grah aadhar' for middle class and lower middle class women earning less than rs 3 lakh per annum. it puts rs 1200 directly into their purse for family expenditure. this applies to allq. what do these schemes cost the state government?manohar parrikar: laadli lakshmi will cost the government about rs 150 crore per year. so far around rs 20,000 girls people have been covered by it. annually around 12,000- 15,000 girls are covered by it. we would have paid 1.20 lakh married women under the gruha-aadhar scheme by november this year. you just check it in terms of the figures of goa...the state has 20,000 annual births?it was about 18,000 eight years back. virtually no one refuses the laadli lakshmi. there are families who feel they don't need it. the total number of families is 3.2 lakhs. do you realize the impact of this? if a family of four, spends rs 4000-rs 6000 per month. they spend rs 1100 per month per person. twenty five per cent of your food bill is paid for by the government. through direct cash transfers.q. how do you transfer these subsidies?manohar parrikar: directly into their bank accounts. through electronic means. the leakage is only through some non-eligible claims claiming by fraudulent data. my estimate is that 95 per cent are genuine. this scheme has been in effect for two years.empowerment of women itself changes the situation. she should feel comfortable and secure.

2016-11-17,reliance jio begins doorstep delivery of sim cards,"mukesh ambani-led reliance industries limited (ril) has started doorstep delivery of reliance jio sim cards in delhi (ncr) and mumbai. first spotted by techpp , and independently confirmed from our sources, the move is intended towards extending the service's reach and availability to more people before it goes live from early next year.update: doorstep delivery of jio sim cards, as independently confirmed from our sources, is currently in beta and is being rolled out area-wise in mumbai, delhi (ncr), chennai, kolkata, ahmedabad, pune, bangalore, hyderabad, vizag, chandigarh and jaipur.it is also possible to get jio sims delivered at your housing complex or office, so more people can simultaneously get jio sim cards. if you happen to stay in a housing complex or work in an office where a group of people is interested in getting the jio welcome offer, you can now invite a jio representative to come to your complex or office and setup a desk where everyone can then get a sim from. to schedule a visit, those interested need to visit jio's website or give a missed mobile call to 1-800-200-200-9 to receive an invite link. this service is now live in 8 cities including mumbai, delhi (ncr), kolkata, chennai, bangalore, hyderabad, pune, and ahmedabad. to recall, reliance jio wants to offer up to 80 per cent of indians high-speed mobile internet as well as voice services in the days to come. the first requisite for that to happen will be to make its sim cards readily available to more and more users. well until now, its sim cards were available for grabs from reliance digital and digital xpress mini stores, and these were synonymous with long queues of people lining up to get their free sim cards. now that jio is heading towards a formal launch, it's only obvious that the company would want to rope in more and more people, potential customers to be precise.jio 4g services have been open to all

2017-06-02,terrifying to write in a world where everything is shredded into tweets: arundhati roy on upcoming novel,"the hijras in your novel live in a parallel world to what they call 'duniya'. that seems a bit like fiction, it draws from the real world, on 'duniya', is an entire world unto itself but is not 'reality'.the way i feel, even the way i live, is as if there are these covers. and you look underneath, or you look to the side, you look this way or that, and there is this whole other world. there is such a hard, and increasingly hardening, definition of what is 'reality', or what is 'majority', what is 'identity.' all realities that people are unfamiliar with are a little fabulous. just the other day in the paper i saw a report about bakarwals in jammu being attacked by gau rakshaks. it's strange when you write fiction, how it intrudes on reality. about a month ago, this bitch and her puppies started living outside my door and it was, like, oh, comrade laali (a dog from the ministry of utmost happiness) is here.the paresh rawal farrago must feel like a kind of appetiser. this is such a political book, do you worry about the reactions, the abuse that is going to inevitably come your way?i was not the writer, ever, who was going to be 'oh, i've written a book, i've won the booker prize! now i'll write another book, win another prize...' no, i said it back then. i'll write a book when i've a book to write. the only ambition i have, really, is the ambition of art. to experiment. i didn't want to sign some big contract straight away, i wanted to be able to throw stuff away. and in this atmosphere, the idea of putting a novel into a world in which everything is just shredded into tweets was terrifying and have it be shredded into tweets was terrifying. i kept telling myself, 'just write it, and keep it in the drawer. write it how you like and keep it in your drawer. but the writer's ego doesn't permit that, once it's done, you can't keep it.' and this book was a way to look at all these complex issues in different ways, from different perspectives.is that the joy of writing fiction? assuming a variety of voices, putting yourself in the place of other people.yes... biplab dasgupta (a high-ranking intelligence officer in the novel), for instance, is not just a moron. he's a brilliant guy. it would have been a great shame if he was just a monster. and he's often right, when he talks about the irony of americans lecturing the vietnamese about human rights, or pakistan talking about genocide in kashmir. fiction is play, which is what i enjoy. the ability to be whimsical, to look into the same room or building through different windows. i also like that fiction demands commitment, demands time, to read as well as write. in this climate of -- what can i say -- plummeting iq. i mean is it a national project to keep our iq down at a certain level? if you do love this country keep the iq up, what are we trying to do? anyway, in this moment when everything has a news cycle which lasts a few hours, it's a radical thing to do something that took 10 years.when you say 'radical', i think also of all the images in the book. the one of the abandoned baby, say. it's a kind of profane nativity scene. the novel seems deeply attached to profanity, makes a point of it. would you say you have a profane way of looking at the world?what is seen by people as profane, i don't see as profane. i think it's beautiful. a little black girl who is the child of what she is the child of (spoiler alert: the child is the product of state rape, if you like)... that's not profane, it is beautiful, it's asking you to question what is profane. there's a cool, hard way of being profane. this is not it.of course... it's not hard-boiled, cynical fiction. it's the opposite of...this is telling you to look at hope that might come from somewhere else.your allegiance has always been to weakness, or rather the oppressed...for the marginal, for the forcibly marginalised which is not necessarily weakness. what is this society that we live in where everybody is a walking barcode, where your name alone provides all the information people need to categorise you, classify you? this grid that is so shallow... the novel invites you to shrug all that off, to live with people who transgress so deeply that the grid does not apply.it's interesting that you use the word grid because some of the criticism around something like aadhar is how hard it is going to be in the future to get off the grid...it's so ironic isn't it that for 20 years you gave kashmiris a number, id, etc for checkposts and now you're giving it to yourself. you're policing yourself in so many ways.your critics have been urging you to get back to fiction. they might regret it...(laughs)what about the indian media's apparent willingness to do the bidding of the state?people who don't understand how the media works structurally might just be angry with individual journalists. good senior journalists are the most endangered; the better you are at your job the less chance you have of surviving. it's not like that in any other profession. i don't watch tv news. recently i saw the exorcist on one of the movie channels and when i watch the news on tv i can literally see all the green stuff, the bile, coming out of the screen. there's something terribly sick that's happening and we need exorcists not analysts. almost all the media's economic turnover comes from advertising. the ownership... well, we know what it is. so how can it be otherwise?you're reliant on the poorest people to fight for their rights while the media runs scared...yeah... they're there, in the forest with their guns, or in kashmir. so much of the anger against me is 'we can't control this person'. i have a voice, my book is being published in 29 countries and they're tearing their hair out, asking 'how can we snuff it out?'do you feel, with all the contempt for you, even in the media, that you're no longer listened to in india?it feels like the opposite, to be honest. the people who make all the noise, they have no idea. every single political essay has been translated, made into pamphlets. when i go to punjab, or somewhere, to speak, thousands of people show up. the media is so busy with its own noise. but why would the media get so hyper about someone like me, why would they feel so threatened? they're anxious, otherwise they'd just ignore me. all the hysteria that's built up over fake news and lies... it's easy for me, but other people die because of it, all the lynchings that happen because of rumour. there's an outsourcing of censorship to the mob. i'm not beholden to anyone; i live off my royalties. i have circles of solidarity around me because of what i have written. but for other people who have to face it alone, face intimidation, to go to court wherever some trumped up charge is filed, they can't cope so they just stop. that's how they wear critics down. look at what they did to those kids (jnu), faking soundtracks...what is your sense of how india has changed in the 20 years since you wrote god of small things?massacres are not new. today (may 23, when the interview was done) is the day after the 30th anniversary of hashimpura (where over 40 young muslim men were rounded up and allegedly killed by police). the massacre of sikhs in 1984 was as heinous as the massacre of muslims in gujarat in 2002, there's no doubt about that. but the question is was there an ideology into which that massacre dovetailed? today you have a population living in absolute terror, the mobs are on the loose. there's a lynching a day to keep everyone in fear. the acceptance of a particularly ugly form of public discourse began with the nuclear tests (1998). it changed something.did nationalism become more overt, more acceptable because of the nuclear tests?the violence of inclusion, the violence of exclusion... the silencing of people, the changing of history. if you love this country, you must recognise that the national iq is dropping faster than the water table.what do you hold on to, what do you still love about india?it's all in the book. every day i wake up and i could just burst out laughing at what i see that day. i love the anarchy. i love the creatures that we have on the streets, the untamedness. i love this city (delhi), even with the pollution. i love the music, the layers of poetry, history, all of it. i love the wisdom of the resistance movements. i'm of this place. and the people who say i don't love india know nothing about the india i love. their india is built on a manifesto of hatred and exclusion. to me even the language in which i write is informed by what i hear around me. it's polyphonic and deeply rooted here.also readparesh rawal wants arundhati roy to be tied to army jeep instead of stone pelter",0.09097482526969708,terrifying write world everything shredded tweets : arundhati roy upcoming novel,"hijras novel live parallel world call ' duniya ' . seems bit like fiction , draws real world , ' duniya ' , entire world unto ' reality ' .the way feel , even way live , covers. look underneath , look side , look way , whole world. hard , increasingly hardening , definition ' reality ' , ' majority ' , ' identity.

2017-08-08,"india bans wayback machine, makes it harder to catch liars on the web","in a move that has to be seen as nothing but an attempt to obfuscate information, the indian government has ordered blocking of wayback machine hosted at archive.org/web. unlike many porn sites, torrent sites and file hosts blocked in india, the wayback machine is a web tool that seemingly has public utility. this makes the ban strange. for now the blocking of the internet archive is sporadic with some isps blocking the website in some regions while in many other instances users getting through to the site.update: finally, there is some information about why the wayback machine aka internet archives has been blocked in india. it has reportedly happened on the orders of madras high court, which was acting on a plea filed by the distributors of two movies. the court was approached by distributors of jab harry met sejal and lipstick under burka seeking relief from people who they called pirates. the distributors gave the court a list of urls that they wanted blocked in india and one of the url in the list was archive.org aka wayback machine.update: while the ban is real, there is no explanation or communication from the government about it. the wayback machine reportedly reached out to both the department of telecom (dot) and meity but has not received any response. ""multiple attempts to contact the dot and meity (deity was the agency that ultimately ended up responding to us regarding the previous block) have gone unanswered thus far (we first tried to reach out to them about 22 hours ago). obviously, we are disappointed and concerned by this situation and are very eager to understand why it's happening and see full access restored to archive.org,"" the organisation said in statement. with the wayback machine blocked, indians will find it difficult to catch liars on the internet. it may even hit india's attempt to root out corruption, doublespeak and is likely to make a number of government bodies less accountable to citizens.a large number of users are getting the message shown for blocked sites when they are trying to access the wayback machine. the message reads that the website has been blocked on the directions of department of telecom. the block on the wayback machine was first noticed by medianama .wayback machine, if you are not familiar, works like an archive of the internet. everyday it crawls through millions of webpages, similar to how google does it, and then saves snapshots of the websites as it saw them. this allows web users to go back to a particular date and then check out a specific website or web page the way it looked on that date.although the wayback machine is a very useful and valuable tool for public, it is not particularly liked by government bodies because it allows internet users to catch lies. for example, on a particular date a government department may publish a circular. in future if it withdraws the circular, something that happens quite frequently whenever the government has something to hide, it could still be found on the wayback machine.in recent days a number of web users have pointed out the disconnect between what the uidai, the agency behind aadhaar, noted earlier on its website and what it later did. to prove there was a mismatch between the talk and deed of the agency, many internet users relied on wayback machine.the wayback machine is also useful in keeping a record of the promises made by politicians and organisations. for example the news reports from a particular date, even when those reports have been deleted by the organisations that wrote them, could be highlighted through wayback machine to showcase how a government wasn't keeping its promise.essentially, what the wayback machine does is that it makes lying in public difficult. it is possible that people in the department of telecommunications don't like this kind of functionality that indian citizens can use to find people and organisations who tend to lie.also read: how to link aadhaar with pan card using online site, sms before june 30 deadline ends ",0.03549898682877406,"india bans wayback machine , makes harder catch liars web","move seen nothing attempt obfuscate information , indian government ordered blocking wayback machine hosted archive.org/web. unlike many porn sites , torrent sites file hosts blocked india , wayback machine web tool seemingly public utility. makes ban strange. blocking internet archive sporadic isps blocking website regions many instances users getting site.update : finally , information wayback machine aka internet archives blocked india. reportedly happened orders madras high court , acting plea filed distributors two movies. court approached distributors jab harry met sejal lipstick burka seeking relief people called pirates. distributors gave court list urls wanted blocked india one url list archive.org aka wayback machine.update : ban real , explanation communication government it. wayback machine reportedly reached department telecom ( dot ) meity received response.

2017-10-19,meyaadha maan movie review: vaibhav's film is royapuram ga na land,"with a new brigade of filmmakers coming up with fascinating scripts, 2017 is turning out to be a fantastic year for tamil cinema. rathna kumar's meyaadha maan (deer which doesn't graze) is yet another gem that doesn't disappoint. even before the release, meyaadha maan was projected as the la la land of royapuram. we are not sure about the la la land part, but the film is definitely not vanilla. it's extremely gratifying, especially when a filmmaker makes an impressive debut.meyaadha maan begins with a shakespearean quote that all men and women are 'merely' players. in some ways, the screenplay's structure is written in such a way that meyaadha maan is primarily about murali (vaibhav), who runs a wedding music band called 'meyaadha maan', and his college mate s madhumitha (priya bhavani shankar, who's very beautiful).long before ranbir kapoor became the poster boy of 'unrequited love', tamil cinema had 'idhayam' murali. the murali in meyaadha maan, too, is unable to express his love for madhu, who's already engaged. rathna kumar wants to tell a rom-com that calculatedly avoids mainstream approach, which could have easily been an idharkuthane aasaipattai balakumara. as unusual as it may sound, the film opens with a shot of murali attempting suicide.but we feel for murali because he's torn between the surrounding (it's centered in north chennai) and male ego. the latter in the sense that when madhu wants to sleep with him, murali says, ""alaiyara (lustful)."" he's innocent, but he keeps referring to madhu as ""ketta ponnu"". he's also self-indulgent. for instance, murali doesn't ask his friend vinoth if he wants to marry his sister. in fact, there's a scene in the second half, where murali's sister soodar (induja, who's really, really good) chides him and says, ""poi saavu anna.""from the descriptions above, meyaadha maan may appear to be this really intense and emotionally draining film that is usually associated with karthik subbaraj. but, it isn't. remember, it's royapuram la la land and hence, it has musical bits, lots of humour (vinoth prasanna is the best thing to have happened), and a not-bad romance.as with the setting, meyaadha maan provides certain exquisiteness, thanks to pradeep kumar and santhosh narayanan's soulful songs, especially the sublime guitar interludes in enna naa seivan. the theatre was filled with laughter when address song popped up. that's the thing with meyaadha maan. it could be unwittingly funny and a tad bit boring at times.there are more than a couple of moments to cherish in this wonderfully written film. mainly because of its homespun proceedings and rooted dialogues. for once, the heroines don't look alien and sound naive to the film's milieu. consider the scene where a woman sings kolangal song at a wedding.it largely works perhaps due to vaibhav's rawness and his one-liners like ""aadhar card la kooda azhaga irupa."" he's damn good when he breaks into dance at a hospital.meyaadha maan doesn't shy away from its stereotypes. only in the second half do we come to know about the bigger problem in murali-madhu's love story -- the caste angle, which seemed very weak in an otherwise decent film. madhu is a brahmin! this, we're not explicitly told, but rathna kumar wants to you notice her mother's fake tambrahm accent. how come madhu's father speaks chennai slang then?the romance, too, is not properly established here.when there's so much freshness in the script, these minor issues can be brushed aside.( the writer tweets as @lonewolf_7126 )watch here: meyaadha maan trailer",0.1266521784666946,meyaadha maan movie review : vaibhav ' film royapuram ga na land,"new brigade filmmakers coming fascinating scripts , 2017 turning fantastic year tamil cinema. rathna kumar ' meyaadha maan ( deer ' graze ) yet another gem ' disappoint. even release , meyaadha maan projected la la land royapuram. sure la la land part , film definitely vanilla.

2018-01-15,aadhaar cards: uidai enables face recognition to get more indians on board,"the unique identification authority of india or uidai has announced face authentication to get more indians on-board the aadhaar bandwagon. face authentication technology, which will exist alongside the incumbent fingerprint authentication technology, will apparently help the elderly – or for that matter, anyone experiencing issues with the existing technology – have a seamless experience even as the said technology will add another layer of security to aadhaar.the announcement comes days after the newspaper tribune exposed how insecure the aadhaar authentication system was and how it was leaking information of over a billion aadhaar holders, including their aadhaar number and demographic details. uidai, however, claims that aadhaar is completely secure and that leaking of demographic details doesn’t matter. inclusion of face authentication, it would seem, is uidai’s fresh attempt to ensure – or at least give out a message -- safety and security of aadhaar holders across the board and all the others who are yet to join the bandwagon. the service will be launched by july 1.“uidai introduces yet another landmark technology for authentication - face authentication. #aadhaarfaceauth will help all elderly or others facing issues with fingerprint authentication. service to be launched by 1 july 2018,” uiadai ceo ajay bhushan pandey wrote on twitter.also read: uidai announces virtual aadhaar id, hopes it will solve privacy problemsuidai’s face authentication technology, it has come to light, will work in tandem with one or more authentication factor -- fingerprint, iris or otp for authentication, which means that it can’t be used in isolation. this is probably because face authentication isn’t actually one of the safest methods of authentication around. while it isn’t exactly clear how uidai plans on going about implementing face authentication for aadhaar, the technology as such isn’t new or ground-breaking. the technology is being used extensively on smartphones by both big-ticket companies like samsung and apple and chinese counterparts like oppo and vivo.take the iphone x for instance. the iphone x is notably the first iphone ever to ditch touch id in favour of face id which means apple's shiny new iphone doesn't ship with a fingerprint scanner. facial recognition technology on-board the iphone x is aided by a truedepth camera system consisting of depth-sensing hardware: a dot projector, an infrared camera and a flood illuminator that apparently makes face id a whole lot secure than apple's tried and tested touch id.""face id projects more than 30,000 invisible ir dots. the ir image and dot pattern are pushed through neural networks to create a mathematical model of your face and send the data to the secure enclave to confirm a match, while adapting to physical changes in appearance over time. all saved facial information is protected by the secure enclave to keep data extremely secure, while all of the processing is done on-device and not in the cloud to protect user privacy. face id only unlocks iphone x when customers look at it and is designed to prevent spoofing by photos or masks,"" according to apple. in essence, apple claims that its face id is safer, faster and adaptable. but it has already been broken down by a vietnamese security company of the name bkav.samsung, meanwhile, uses its own technology to offer facial recognition on its high-end galaxy note 8 and galaxy s8. its mid-level phones like the galaxy a8+ use android’s smart unlock to make use of the technology. the same is true about companies like oppo and vivo as well. but all these companies make sure to let users know – beforehand – that facial recognition isn’t one hundred per cent foolproof. it’s prone to hacking, sometimes using a method as simple as showing it a photo of yourself. it would be interesting to see uidai’s approach to face authentication as and when the service goes live in the coming months. it would be interesting, not so much because of the technology that would come into play, but for the simple fact that aadhaar has been under scrutiny by privacy advocates since the time that it has existed. it has been labeled as a surveillance mechanism, by them, and the recent reports of data breach haven’t been helping its case either.",0.16474087378342694,aadhaar cards : uidai enables face recognition get indians board,"unique identification authority india uidai announced face authentication get indians on-board aadhaar bandwagon. face authentication technology , exist alongside incumbent fingerprint authentication technology , apparently help elderly – matter , anyone experiencing issues existing technology – seamless experience even said technology add another layer security aadhaar.the announcement comes days newspaper tribune exposed insecure aadhaar authentication system leaking information billion aadhaar holders , including aadhaar number demographic details. uidai , however , claims aadhaar completely secure leaking demographic details ’ matter. inclusion face authentication , would seem , uidai ’ fresh attempt ensure – least give message -- safety security aadhaar holders across board others yet join bandwagon. service launched july 1.“uidai introduces yet another landmark technology authentication -

2018-03-22,aadhaar is generating data that indians will be able to sell or barter for benefits: nandan nilekani,"in a rather contrived way, nandan nilekani, the current chairman of infosys and architect of aadhaar programme, on thursday asserted that systems like aadhaar and upi can make indians richer. he said that indians are getting data rich and they will be able to sell or share this data for actual money or services.nilekani said that all data, the digital trail that is available because of aadhar and upi, is good because indians will be able to sell or barter their information to get economical benefits.speaking at first #future conference, organised by kerala government to promote the state to it companies and entrepreneurs, nilekani said that india and west were different when it came to handling and using data. he said that in countries like the us people were economically rich before the digital services entered into the picture and data was generated on people. those rich people, he asserted, might have different ways in which they could use their own data. but in india it is different.nilekani said that in india people are poor economically but with the help of aadhaar and upi have become data rich. he said that unlike in the west where data is held by a handful of people hinting at the founders of companies like google and facebook in india data belongs to small players, like banks, mobile companies and individuals. because indians are now data rich, individuals will be able to give or barter their data for economical benefits such as low-cost treatment in a hospital or better loan deals based on tax records, said nilekani.while the idea of people, who are poor economically but rich with data, bartering their information for monetary benefits sounds interesting, it is also a rather weird trade. the argument treats data like a commodity, disregarding some of the other facets such as privacy, dignity and rule of law. it is akin to saying that poor women can sell sex for economic benefits and hence selling sex is perfectly alright. but seemingly nilenkani doesnt look at it like it. he believes that once india has some data protection law, bartering personal data for economic benefit would give poor indians a viable way to get goods and services.when asked if he had any fresh concerns about aadhaar in the wake of cambridge analytica-facebook controversy, nilekani said that it was not something that people in india needed to worry about. he said that aadhaar programme and infrastructure is completely safe and secure. this incident doesnt weaken aadhaar case at all, nilekani said, hinting at the case in supreme court, which is hearing a constitutional challenge to aadhaar. we have a good case.",0.18693181818181814,aadhaar generating data indians able sell barter benefits : nandan nilekani,"rather contrived way , nandan nilekani , current chairman infosys architect aadhaar programme , thursday asserted systems like aadhaar upi make indians richer. said indians getting data rich able sell share data actual money services.nilekani said data , digital trail available aadhar upi , good indians able sell barter information get economical benefits.speaking first #future conference , organised kerala government promote state companies entrepreneurs , nilekani said india west different came handling using data. said countries like us people economically rich digital services entered picture data generated people. rich people , asserted , might different ways could use data. india different.nilekani said india people poor economically help aadhaar upi become data rich. said unlike west data held handful people hinting founders companies like google facebook india data belongs small players , like banks , mobile companies individuals. indians data rich , individuals able give barter data economical benefits low-cost treatment hospital better loan deals based tax records , said nilekani.while idea people , poor economically rich data , bartering information monetary benefits sounds interesting , also rather weird trade. argument treats data like commodity , disregarding facets privacy , dignity rule law. akin saying poor women sell sex economic benefits hence selling sex perfectly alright. seemingly nilenkani doesnt look like it. believes india data protection law , bartering personal data economic benefit would give poor indians viable way get goods services.when asked fresh concerns aadhaar wake cambridge analytica-facebook controversy , nilekani said something people india needed worry about. said aadhaar programme infrastructure completely safe secure. incident doesnt weaken aadhaar case , nilekani said , hinting case supreme court , hearing constitutional challenge aadhaar. good case .","{'bjp': 0, 'cong': 0}",0,0
2018-03-24,"govt's 5-foot thick walls may not be enough to secure aadhaar data, suggests new leak","a data leak on a system run by a state-owned utility company can potentially allow hackers to access private information of every aadhaar holder in india, if a new zdnet report is to be gone by. the data leak affects potentially every indian citizen subscribed to the aadhaar program, according to the report, exposing names, their unique 12-digit identity numbers, and also information about services they are connected to, such as their bank details. the government of india, the report adds, knows about the data leak but is yet to take any concrete steps to fix the loophole.first spotted by karan saini, a new delhi-based security researcher, the leak has apparently stemmed from a non-secure api that the unnamed utility provider relies on to access the aadhaar database in order to verify a customer's identity. specific details about the utility provider, as well as the vulnerability have been withheld from the public at this point of time, in the report, citing security concerns. what's being shared, however, is that the vulnerable api's endpoint -- which is an unspecified url -- uses a hardcoded access token that can allow anyone with a little technical know-how to query aadhaar numbers against the database without requiring any additional piece of authentication.the reported vulnerability can be exploited to access private data of any aadhaar holder, regardless of whether he/she is a customer of the utility provider or not. what makes matters worse is that the non-secure api doesn't have any rate limiting in place which means hackers can sift through every permutation of aadhaar numbers and retrieve private information each and every time they stumble upon a successful result.running a few aadhaar numbers from friends who gave him permission, through the endpoint, saw saini successfully getting a hold of an aadhaar holder's full name and their consumer number, as also their connected bank details, more specifically the name of the bank the person used. although the report mentions no further bank details were churned out, the fact that bank details, at all made the cut is in sharp contradiction to the unique identification authority's (uidai) claims that the aadhaar database does not keep any information about bank accounts. a similar stance was also recently conveyed by union it minister, ravi shankar prasad.""from the requests that were sent to check for a rate limiting issue and determine the possibility of stumbling across valid aadhaar numbers, i have found that this information is not retrieved from a static database or a one-off data grab, but is clearly being updated -- from as early as 2014 to mid 2017. i cannot speculate whether it is uidai that is providing this information to [the utility provider], or if the banks or gas companies are, but it seems that everyone's information is available, with no authentication -- no rate limit, nothing,"" saini was quoted by zdnet as saying.the revelations, in the report, come at a time when the government of india is arguing in front of the supreme court, how safe and secure its unique id system was. the government of india has, in fact, told the supreme court that aadhaar data taken from millions of indians was safe behind 5-feet thick walls, reiterating it can't be breached. the report, however, makes stark claims that the government of india is aware of the purported flaw in the system, and yet it has done nothing to fix the flaw. the report, further adds, that it would publish further specifics once the flaw has been fixed.also read: govt says aadhaar data is safe because it is kept behind 5-feet thick walls. wait what?",0.08989624505928852,"govt ' 5-foot thick walls may enough secure aadhaar data , suggests new leak","data leak system run state-owned utility company potentially allow hackers access private information every aadhaar holder india , new zdnet report gone by. data leak affects potentially every indian citizen subscribed aadhaar program , according report , exposing names , unique 12-digit identity numbers , also information services connected , bank details. government india , report adds , knows data leak yet take concrete steps fix loophole.first spotted karan saini , new delhi-based security researcher , leak apparently stemmed non-secure api unnamed utility provider relies access aadhaar database order verify customer ' identity. specific details utility provider , well vulnerability withheld public point time , report , citing security concerns.

2018-07-23,"ahead of key supreme court verdict, nandan nilekani says aadhaar should not be made mandatory","with a key supreme court verdict, which will decide the constitutionality of aadhaar project, expected soon, one of the biggest cheerleaders of the project nandan nilekani has said that it should not be made mandatory. his views run counter to the argument that the government has made in the last few years, as it has tried to make aadhaar mandatory not only for availing government services but also for basic private services like a cellular phone connection.although nilekani has not argued in favour of ""mandatory aadhaar"", he also, until now, never took a stance against the government view that believes aadhaar should be mandatory for a number of services in india.aadhaar, the 12-digit number supposed to give a unique identity to millions of indians, has been in news ever since it was introduced in 2010. while data privacy is undeniably one of the biggest issues surrounding aadhaar, the unique identification authority of india (uidai) number has also been criticised for not being able to deliver benefits to the end users, particularly the subsidy provided by the government under its ration card scheme, which requires aadhaar number for verification.there are reports that even children have lost their lives after being denied food for not having a ration card linked with aadhaar number. and yet, supporters of aadhaar have strongly taken its case forward and advocated a wider implementation across services and platforms across the country.infosys co-founder and bureaucrat nandan nilekani has been one of the strongest supporters of aadhaar. he was the first chairman of uidai and under his leadership, aadhaar took off from an idea to an entity that linked the country through a common thread providing benefits and in many cases an identity to those who had no means of proving their identity in a country with a population of over 132 crore people.while time and again the indian bureaucrat, politician, and entrepreneur has stressed on the need to have a strong data privacy law along with the aadhaar law, he has also affirmed that aadhaar as a system is free from all vices. ""but to say that because of aadhaar privacy is gone, as if there's nothing else happening on the planet, is, i think, a bit disingenuous,"" he had said in an interview to quartz in april 2017.notably, data privacy is not the only issue surrounding aadhaar. modi-goverment's strong push of what can be described as the ""aadhaar-ification"" of the country has raised flags among the privacy advocates.last year, the central government in a bid to push its ""aadhaar objective"" had set march 31 as the deadline for linking bank accounts and mobile phones with the 12-digit unique id number. however, the supreme court in its verdict in march this year extended this deadline indefinitely while allowing the governmental agencies to link the aadhaar number for the transfer of beneficiary schemes.now, months after the debate about aadhaar being made mandatory stirred the country, nilekani, who is rightly described as the father of aadhaar, has broken his silence on the issue.his views? aadhaar should not be made mandatory except for a few things like pan card, etc.""i don't believe that aadhar should be mandatory. and we need to protect people's privacy,"" nilekani said in an interview with vir sanghvi.nilekani believes that in a utopian world, aadhaar would not be made mandatory except for a few things like pan card etc, people would not be denied benefits because they don't have aadhaar card, and people at the point of delivery would be allowed to use discretion in regard to passing on the benefits associated with aadhaar. ""not mandatory expect for a few things,"" he said.when asked if he was ok with the supreme court not making aadhaar mandatory, the former uidai chairman said he was absolutely fine with it.

2018-07-23,"ahead of key supreme court verdict, nandan nilekani says aadhaar should not be made mandatory","with a key supreme court verdict, which will decide the constitutionality of aadhaar project, expected soon, one of the biggest cheerleaders of the project nandan nilekani has said that it should not be made mandatory. his views run counter to the argument that the government has made in the last few years, as it has tried to make aadhaar mandatory not only for availing government services but also for basic private services like a cellular phone connection.although nilekani has not argued in favour of ""mandatory aadhaar"", he also, until now, never took a stance against the government view that believes aadhaar should be mandatory for a number of services in india.aadhaar, the 12-digit number supposed to give a unique identity to millions of indians, has been in news ever since it was introduced in 2010. while data privacy is undeniably one of the biggest issues surrounding aadhaar, the unique identification authority of india (uidai) number has also been criticised for not being able to deliver benefits to the end users, particularly the subsidy provided by the government under its ration card scheme, which requires aadhaar number for verification.there are reports that even children have lost their lives after being denied food for not having a ration card linked with aadhaar number. and yet, supporters of aadhaar have strongly taken its case forward and advocated a wider implementation across services and platforms across the country.infosys co-founder and bureaucrat nandan nilekani has been one of the strongest supporters of aadhaar. he was the first chairman of uidai and under his leadership, aadhaar took off from an idea to an entity that linked the country through a common thread providing benefits and in many cases an identity to those who had no means of proving their identity in a country with a population of over 132 crore people.while time and again the indian bureaucrat, politician, and entrepreneur has stressed on the need to have a strong data privacy law along with the aadhaar law, he has also affirmed that aadhaar as a system is free from all vices. ""but to say that because of aadhaar privacy is gone, as if there's nothing else happening on the planet, is, i think, a bit disingenuous,"" he had said in an interview to quartz in april 2017.notably, data privacy is not the only issue surrounding aadhaar. modi-goverment's strong push of what can be described as the ""aadhaar-ification"" of the country has raised flags among the privacy advocates.last year, the central government in a bid to push its ""aadhaar objective"" had set march 31 as the deadline for linking bank accounts and mobile phones with the 12-digit unique id number. however, the supreme court in its verdict in march this year extended this deadline indefinitely while allowing the governmental agencies to link the aadhaar number for the transfer of beneficiary schemes.now, months after the debate about aadhaar being made mandatory stirred the country, nilekani, who is rightly described as the father of aadhaar, has broken his silence on the issue.his views? aadhaar should not be made mandatory except for a few things like pan card, etc.""i don't believe that aadhar should be mandatory. and we need to protect people's privacy,"" nilekani said in an interview with vir sanghvi.nilekani believes that in a utopian world, aadhaar would not be made mandatory except for a few things like pan card etc, people would not be denied benefits because they don't have aadhaar card, and people at the point of delivery would be allowed to use discretion in regard to passing on the benefits associated with aadhaar. ""not mandatory expect for a few things,"" he said.when asked if he was ok with the supreme court not making aadhaar mandatory, the former uidai chairman said he was absolutely fine with it. ""yes, i am fine with it (on aadhaar not being made mandatory). the real use of aadhaar is when it is used for delivering online benefits, innovation on top of this. so if is not mandatory for something, i'm fine with it,"" he said.besides sharing his views on aadhaar, nilekani also shed light on two of the most important questions pertaining the unique number.when asked if aadhaar could be used for mass surveillance of the indian citizens, nilekani rubbished the claims saying that if someone were to do a mass surveillance of the people, they would use mobile phones.

""tell me what harm can you do to me if you have my aadhaar details? i will give you my aadhaar number if you like,"" sharma told the website.his challenge did not go down well with twitter users and one of them dared him to walk the talk.the entire episode took an interesting turn when sharma responding to the tweet by the tweep who goes by the name kingslyj on the platform and shared his aadhaar number in tweet, despite there being a law making sharing aadhaar number in public a punishable crime.my aadhaar number is 7621 7768 2740now i give this challenge to you: show me one concrete example where you can do any harm to me!rs sharma (@rssharma3) july 28, 2018the trai chairman, who is widely being touted as the head of the new data protection authority, in a subsequent tweet promised to take no action against the people who reveal his private details.

""our internal review has revealed that in 2014, the then uidai helpline number and the 112 distress helpline number were inadvertently coded into the setup wizard of the android release given to oems for use in india and has remained there since. we will work towards fixing this in an upcoming release of setup wizard which will be made available to oems over the next few weeks,"" said a google spokesperson in a statement issued late on friday night.uidai clarifies standproblem is, the uidai helpline number (1800-300-1947) being saved in android phones across india is not even up-to-date, something that even the uidai has come up and acknowledged. in fact, the authority has said that it ""hasn't asked or communicated to any manufacturer or service provider for providing any such facility,"" going on to blame ""vested interests"" for causing confusion.the issue came to light late on thursday night when french hacker who goes by the pseudonym elliot alderson asked people on twitter if they had the uidai helpline in their phonebooks. within hours, social media was abuzz with people posting screenshots confirming that the uidai helpline had been saved in their android phones, without their knowledge or consent.""many people, with different provider, with and without an #aadhaar card, with and without the maadhaar app installed, noticed that your phone number is predefined in their contact list by default and so without their knowledge. can you explain why?"" alderson had tweeted.telecom operators have no cluetelecom operators are known to bundle emergency numbers and services with their sim cards. often this is after a government authority makes it a guideline. but in this case, the uidai has come up and denied it hasn't given out any such directions.while it could not be independently confirmed with the phone manufacturers, the issue raises both fear and concern, how the helpline number made its way to so many android phones. india today tech reached out to google, and the company that's behind android said that it is currently investigating the matter.so who did it? google's android probably the question is from where this number is coming? and the likely answer is that the number is coming from google's android operating system, which powers over 90 per cent smartphones in india.the operating system apparently started adding the uidai number to phones last year at operating system level on the basis of a phone's location. the number was added only to phones in india. this is something @kingslyj on twitter has found.also read: trai chief's daughter threatened on her private email after he shared aadhaar number, challenged hackers",0.06938244047619048,"android users find aadhaar helpline number saved phones , google says bug 2014","days trai chairman rs sharma took social media storm , sharing aadhaar number twitter challenging people harm , unique identification authority india uida found fresh controversy. uidai ' helpline number randomly saved default many android phones , users idea why.the issue seems specific android phones ' limited one two telecom operators even one two brands phones. android phones seem affected , ' matter ' using airtel , vodafone jio.update : google clarified issue change made 2014. said sorry it.

2018-08-06,hacker claims he can crack eaadhaar password in under 3 seconds,"aadhaar has become quite the buzzword these days, and particularly since telecom regulatory authority of india (trai) chief rs sharma caused a furor by revealing his aadhaar number on twitter. ever since sharma pulled the stunt to prove that aadhaar was safe and secure, people on social media are trying to prove him wrong. in latest such effort, a hacker called somdev sangwan has claimed that he can crack the password of eaadhaar in less than 3 seconds. and to prove his point, he has detailed his methodology in a blog post.sangwan in a blog post on noteworthy has claimed that he can crack the eaadhaar password in just 3 seconds! in case you are wondering how he achieves such a feat, the answer, as he says is simple: using some basic mathematics and clever algorithms that can cycle through the possible password combinations very fast.sangwan uses the classic brute force password cracking method, but cleverly prunes the dictionary of possible password combinations that his algorithms will use to crack the eaadhaar password to shorten the duration the whole exercise will take.in his blog post, sangwan explains that the aadhaar password is the combination of the first four letters of a person's name in upper case and his year of birth. given that data, the total number of combinations possible is 2821109907456, which will take around 92 years to for a person to crack a password if one tries 1000 combinations per second.but no one has that much time. so, sangwan has come up with a different method. he reduces the duration required to go through the possible password combinations to 53 days by breaking down the password into two strings. but 53 days is a time period too long to dedicate for cracking a password. and so, he further reduces the time duration to 13 hours by eliminating the years that aren't valid for the possible password. for example no one born before 1910 is likely to have aadhaar number.to this then he adds a dictionary of popular indian names, giving the password crunching algorithms even a narrower focus and thereby reduces the time duration to around 2 minutes and 39.8 seconds.if you think you can't go lower than that, think again as the hacker then goes on to explain how you can crack the password in just 1.73 seconds by further dividing the names into groups based on popularity and religion.if his calculations are accurate, one should be able to crack eaadhaar password in a blink of an eye (literally).this is not the first time that hackers have made such claims. back in march this year, french security researcher elliot alderson shared a video demonstrating how it was possible to bypass the protection on aadhaar's android app in one minute.also read: aaadhaar number in phones: uidai says google has clarified and now people can shut up about it alderson is one of the strongest critics of aadhaar and time and again he has pointed out vulnerabilities in the aadhaar system.",0.10311653116531168,hacker claims crack eaadhaar password 3 seconds,"aadhaar become quite buzzword days , particularly since telecom regulatory authority india ( trai ) chief rs sharma caused furor revealing aadhaar number twitter. ever since sharma pulled stunt prove aadhaar safe secure , people social media trying prove wrong. latest effort , hacker called somdev sangwan claimed crack password eaadhaar less 3 seconds. prove point , detailed methodology blog post.sangwan blog post noteworthy claimed crack eaadhaar password 3 seconds !
