2008-02-07,kerala govt moots separate season for women pilgrims at sabari,"the kerala government has mooted a separate pilgrimage season for women at sabarimala ayyappa temple to end controversy over ban on entry of women of certain age groups at the hill shrine.in its affidavit filed in the apex court yesterday in response to a case seeking a direction to lift the traditional ban on women in the age group of 10 to 50 at the temple, the government has also suggested that the court could form a scholars' panel to study the proposal.the affidavit said the government was of the view that there should not be any ""gender discrimination"".though the government was for maintaining equal status for men and women, a separate season for women was necessary in view of the practical difficulties in providing facilities for women when lakhs of devotees flock in sabrimala during the pilgrimage season between november and january, it said.apparently referring to strong opposition by conservative groups against the entry of women of all ages, it said the government was not the ""last word"", as customs and traditions would also have to be taken into consideration.therefore, the court could appoint a scholars' panel to study various aspects of the issue as government has no plans to bring in a legislation. the government will go by the court's decision, the affidavit, which was filed in response to the petition by young lawyers association, said.the entry of women into the hill shrine had become a major controversy after claims by kannada actress jayamala that she had entered the sanctum sanctorum of the temple years ago.defending its stand on allowing women at the shrine, the government said traditions of sabarimala had not remained the same all through the years and there are records showing that women were allowed to worship there even in the past. the visit of women might have been restricted in view of the arduous trek through the forest path. but things have now changed as devotees could go on vehicles up to some distance of the shrine and also the communication facilities had improved considerably over the years.there were records that maharani of erstwhile travancore kingdom had visited the shrine in the last century, it said.the affidavit said the government was bound to defend the fundamental rights of all citizens regardless of religious, caste, class or gender differences.the controversy arose two years ago when jayamala claimed that she had visited the temple in the prime of her youth and even touched the lord's idol by entering the sanctum sanctorum.some women's groups seized on jayamala's claim to carry forward their campaign for temple entry right but traditionalists opposed changing the customs zealously guarded by the temple over the centuries.",0.05532407407407407,kerala govt moots separate season women pilgrims sabari,"kerala government mooted separate pilgrimage season women sabarimala ayyappa temple end controversy ban entry women certain age groups hill shrine.in affidavit filed apex court yesterday response case seeking direction lift traditional ban women age group 10 50 temple , government also suggested court could form scholars ' panel study proposal.the affidavit said government view "" gender discrimination "" .though government maintaining equal status men women , separate season women necessary view practical difficulties providing facilities women lakhs devotees flock sabrimala pilgrimage season november january , said.apparently referring strong opposition conservative groups entry women ages , said government "" last word "" , customs traditions would also taken consideration.therefore , court could appoint scholars ' panel study various aspects issue government plans bring legislation. government go court ' decision , affidavit , filed response petition young lawyers association , said.the entry women hill shrine become major controversy claims kannada actress jayamala entered sanctum sanctorum temple years ago.defending stand allowing women shrine , government said traditions sabarimala remained years records showing women allowed worship even past. visit women might restricted view arduous trek forest path. things changed devotees could go vehicles distance shrine also communication facilities improved considerably years.there records maharani erstwhile travancore kingdom visited shrine last century , said.the affidavit said government bound defend fundamental rights citizens regardless religious , caste , class gender differences.the controversy arose two years ago jayamala claimed visited temple prime youth even touched lord ' idol entering sanctum sanctorum.some women ' groups seized jayamala ' claim carry forward campaign temple entry right traditionalists opposed changing customs zealously guarded temple centuries .","{'bjp': 0, 'cong': 0}",0,0

2018-05-10,mahanati movie review: nag ashwin crafts a soulful ode to savitri's life,"watching legendary actress savitri's personal and professional life unfold on screen is the most surreal experience. and director nag ashwin's effective portrayal of the actress's life is just the perfect ode to her achievements.10 minutes into the movie, we are yet to see savitri's (keerthy suresh) face. her son finds out that she has slipped into coma and is struggling to get the doctors in bengaluru to attend to her. slowly, news about the 'savitri' being in the hospital spreads like wildfire and we see a horde of people waiting with bated breath to know what has happened to their star who is a demi-god.perhaps nag ashwin didn't want to show savitri in a vulnerable state, so he never shows her face when she is in coma.the real story of savitri is introduced to us by reporter madhuravani (samantha akkineni), who is struggling to make a name for herself at the press she works. she is handed over an assignment to decode some 'juicy' information about savitri's life, who has been in coma for a year. madhuravani and her photographer anthony (vijay deverakonda) stumble upon an old photographer named kesavan, who shares anecdotes about his first meeting with savitri.it is through kesavan's flashback that we get to see savitri's young and beautiful face. she is enacting a scene where tears are required to roll down from one of her eyes. unfortunately, the glycerine bottle that they were supposed to use is broken. but, savitri, as feisty as she always is, confidently marches towards the director and asks him how many drops of tears he requires.it is these little things that make mahanati/nadigaiyar thilagam, one of the best biopics of all time. during her childhood, savitri is shown as the kid who is unapologetic and brave enough to take on anything that is thrown at her. be it bharatanatyam or acting in theatre plays, she nails it with perfection because she is a born star.nag ashwin's way of telling a parallel story as that of savitri and madhuravani's life is efficacious. as samantha's character learns many important life lessons from savitri, we continue to stare in awe at what an amazing woman savitri was.she is often referred to as a home-breaker, but your opinions are bound to change after seeing mahanati. her habit of lending a helping hand even when her life is at an all-time low makes you root for her throughout.savitri is childlike at times, who enjoys the littlest of things and on the other side, she is fierce enough to direct her film with an all-women team. she was generous, brave and also reckless. the journey of savitri from her childhood to stepping into films to having fallen head over heels in love with gemini ganesan to a meteoric rise in her career to the downfall - is shown beautifully. and this story is told at a leisurely pace, which makes the audience observe every single thing in each frame.keerthy suresh, whom we have seen in commercial potboilers, has finally arrived as a performer. she has lived the role and in certain portions of the film, you wonder whether it is keerthy or savitri you are watching on screen. samantha's commitment to play a second female lead at this point in her career is commendable as she has delivered a subtle performance as an ambitious journalist.after keerthy, dulquer salmaan as gemini ganesan steals the show. his loving stare is just enough to make anyone fall in love with him and this quality makes dulquer salmaan stay true to gemini ganesan's epithet 'kadhal mannan' (king of love).nag ashwin has done a perfect job in assembling an ensemble cast who fit their parts like a glove. if its nag ashwin's brilliant story that wows you, wait for cinematographer dani sanchez-lopez' work to take the film to a next level.in a scene, where savitri is dejected and is planning to drown herself in the bottle, his camera, which is upside down, pans from her head to toe, signifying that her life is going downhill. mickey j meyer's music is just the perfect addition to this poignant story.at the end of the film, you are left wondering why savitris good deeds never grabbed the limelight.also see | keerthy suresh on mahanati: savitri's personal life is 80 per cent of her biopicalso see | keerthy suresh's mahanati has already set the box office on fire in usaalso watch | mohanlal reacts over jnu row, sabarimala case and more",0.2448510278428311,mahanati movie review : nag ashwin crafts soulful ode savitri ' life,"watching legendary actress savitri ' personal professional life unfold screen surreal experience. director nag ashwin ' effective portrayal actress ' life perfect ode achievements.10 minutes movie , yet see savitri ' ( keerthy suresh ) face. son finds slipped coma struggling get doctors bengaluru attend her. slowly , news ' savitri ' hospital spreads like wildfire see horde people waiting bated breath know happened star demi-god.perhaps nag ashwin ' want show savitri vulnerable state , never shows face coma.the real story savitri introduced us reporter madhuravani ( samantha akkineni ) , struggling make name press works. handed assignment decode ' juicy ' information savitri ' life , coma year. madhuravani photographer anthony ( vijay deverakonda ) stumble upon old photographer named kesavan , shares anecdotes first meeting savitri.it kesavan ' flashback get see savitri ' young beautiful face. enacting scene tears required roll one eyes. unfortunately , glycerine bottle supposed use broken. , savitri , feisty always , confidently marches towards director asks many drops tears requires.it little things make mahanati/nadigaiyar thilagam , one best biopics time. childhood , savitri shown kid unapologetic brave enough take anything thrown her. bharatanatyam acting theatre plays , nails perfection born star.nag ashwin ' way telling parallel story savitri madhuravani ' life efficacious. samantha ' character learns many important life lessons savitri , continue stare awe amazing woman savitri was.she often referred home-breaker , opinions bound change seeing mahanati. habit lending helping hand even life all-time low makes root throughout.savitri childlike times , enjoys littlest things side , fierce enough direct film all-women team. generous , brave also reckless. journey savitri childhood stepping films fallen head heels love gemini ganesan meteoric rise career downfall -

narendra modi and shiv linga reflected the party's mentality which had become evident when former prime minister rajiv gandhi dubbed the opposition a ""scorpion"" in 1984 polls.he also accused the congress of ""indirectly supporting"" maoists and said the bjp governments at the centre and in chhattisgarh, where elections would be held next month, were determined to finish the naxal menace in
