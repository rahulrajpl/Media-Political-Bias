2017-11-17,allegations relating to rafale deal shameful: sitharaman,"terming the congress allegations about rafale fighter jet deal as ""shameful"", defence minister nirmala sitharaman said today these amounted to ""disservice"" to the armed forces, in first firm rebuttal of the charges levelled by the main opposition party.sitharaman said the cost of each aircraft along with weapon systems was much lower than what was negotiated by the upa government. she alleged that the indecision of the previous upa governments to procure the combat jets ""potentially compromised"" national security interests.she said the inter-governmental agreement with france for ""emergency"" procurement was struck duly following a transparent procedure and after clearance by the cabinet committee on security.""these allegations are shameful...the deal was finalised following a transparent procedure,"" sitharaman told a press conference.questioning the previous upa governments ""inability"" to finalise the deal even after 10 years of negotiations between 2004 and 2014, the defence minister wondered whether the congress does not owe an explanation to the country over the delay in taking a decision when iaf badly needed the jets.she said the present government addressed the ""vacuum"" in the national security structure created by the indecisiveness of the upa dispensation by ""immediately"" going for procurement of 36 aircraft in a fly-away condition.referring to the delays, she said the upa government can be accused of ""error of ommission"" as the indian air force was in critical need of the fighter jets.however, when asked repeatedly about comparative cost of each aircraft negotiated by the then upa government and the rate at which the deal was sealed last year, sitharaman said she was not running away from sharing the details and asked the officials to give the figures to the media.india had inked an inter-governmental agreement with france in september last year for procurement of 36 rafale fighter jets at a cost of around rs 58,000 crore, nearly one- and-half years after prime minister narendra modi announced the proposal during a visit to paris. the delivery of the jets is scheduled to begin from september, 2019.the congress recently raised several questions about the deal including the rates, and accused the government of compromising national interest and security while promoting ""crony capitalism"" and causing a loss to the public exchequer.""that was the grim situation when this government came to power in 2014 and, therefore, we had to move forward so that the air force is not left with unattended requirements for the sake of preparedness,"" she said.""the bickerings about the deal are a disservice to the armed forces,"" she said.french foreign minister jean-yves le drian, after talks with external affairs minister sushma swaraj today, spoke about the deal as he expounded on the ""strategic dimension"" of the bilateral ties.""i am well placed to know that our defence partnership is significant, as shown through the rafale and scorpene projects ? to mention only the most emblematic ones. but it is not limited to the acquisition of military assets, it is far broader than that, as exemplified in our cooperation in the indian ocean,"" she said.sitharaman said the defence procurement procedure allows a contract with a friendly government, and rubbished allegations that government was favouring any businessman through the deal.on congress allegation that dassault aviation, the french manufacturer of rafale, refused transfer of technology (tot) to india, sitharaman said it does not make economic sense to go for tot for 36 aircraft as that would have resulted in escalation of cost.sitharaman said in 2012, rafale was identified as the lowest bidder. however, when her attention was drawn to reports that even the then defence minister a k antony was not convinced whether rafale was indeed the lowest bidder, she said the the government went ahead with the deal considering the ""emergency"" situation.the defence minister said the final agreement for 36 rafale jets was signed in september, 2016, after five rounds of ""lengthy"" discussions between indian and the french sides, and had the approval of the cabinet committee on security.when asked about reports that several members of the high-level committee examining the bids dissented and noted that rafale was not the lowest bidder (l 1), sitharaman said, ""i will go back to see what it is.""separately, union law minister ravi shankar prasad said the charges levelled by the congress over the rafale deal were ""baseless"".""i am amazed over the patently baseless allegations being levelled by the congress party on the whole rafale deal,"" prasad told reporters.he said the deal was ""properly revisited"" at the government-to-government level and many additional facilities and opportunities had been added in terms of weapons, training of indian pilots, and supply of spares.defence secretary sanjay mitra and deputy chief of air staff air marshal r nambiar were also present at the briefing.",0.010627177700348432,allegations relating rafale deal shameful : sitharaman,"terming congress allegations rafale fighter jet deal "" shameful "" , defence minister nirmala sitharaman said today amounted "" disservice "" armed forces , first firm rebuttal charges levelled main opposition party.sitharaman said cost aircraft along weapon systems much lower negotiated upa government. alleged indecision previous upa governments procure combat jets "" potentially compromised "" national security interests.she said inter-governmental agreement france "" emergency "" procurement struck duly following transparent procedure clearance cabinet committee security.

2017-11-23,bjp vs congress over rafale fighter jets: who worked a better deal? explained,"while the first batch of rafale dassault fighter jets will come to india in september 2019 - a new government is expected to be in place by then - the indo-french defence deal seems to be trapped in political mist.the congress has alleged that they worked a better deal with france for rafale fighter jets, while the bjp says that the upa government had not formalised the agreement and left too many grey areas in the deal that could have spiked the cost enormously.the congress has called the rafale deal a rs 50,000 crore scam of the narendra modi government. rahul gandhi of the congress accused the modi government of shying away from parliament (over delay in convening the winter session) due to rafale deal expose.what is rafale deal?rafale deal is a defence agreement signed between the governments of india and france. the deal was signed after long-drawn talks. defence minister nirmala sitharaman recently claimed that the rafale deal has its origin in the atal bihari vajpayee's nda government, which in 2000, emphasised the need to mordernisation of the indian air force.as per records, the procurement of medium multi-role combat aircrafts (mrca) was initiated in 2007, when the then upa government issued a request for proposals. proposals from the six contenders - boeing's super hornet, lockheed martin's f-16in super viper, rac mig's mig-35, saab's gripen c, the eurofighter typhoon and the rafale - were examined by the indian air force.in 2011, the iaf narrowed the focus on the eurofighter typhoon and dassault rafale while rejecting the other contenders. in january, 2012, the iaf identified the rafale as the winner following which negotiations over the cost began.what was in the upa deal?the upa's deal talked about purchase of 126 rafale fighter jets. of these 18 rafale fighter jets were to be delivered by the french company in flyaway condition. the rest 108 were to be manufactured in india at the hindustan aeronautics limited (hal).the cost of the deal had not been finalised during the tenure of the upa government. the congress leaders have claimed that their deal cost less than the one struck by the modi government. interestingly, the projected costs estimated by congress spokesperson randeep singh surjewala and senior party leader kapil sibal for rafale deal vary by a big margin.according to surjewala, the rafale deal worked by the upa government was of rs 42,000 crore while in sibal's calculation the 126-jet deal could have cost rs 79,200 crore.sibal claimed that india could have got 3.5 times the number of rafale jet fighters under the upa's deal by paying only rs 21,000 crore more than being paid under the modi government's agreement.congress leader kapil sibal alleged that the reworked rafale deal is a 58,000 crore scam.however, chief of air staff air chief marshal bs dhanoa recently said that the deal was ""not overpricing... we have negotiated for 36 french fighter aircraft rafale (at a price) lower than that in the contract. the government has negotiated a very good deal.""some reports claimed citing defence sources that the per unit cost of rafale fighters under upa's deal was usd 100 million while under the new terms the per unit cost is usd 90 million. the iaf, recently, also pitched for procuring 36 more rafale jets arguing that the next batch of fighter planes may cost only 60 per cent of the original price.transfer of technologythe congress has claimed that under the upa deal, the rafale had agreed to transfer of technology while under the modi government's agreement, there is no such binding on the french company. nirmala sitharaman, rejecting the charge said that transfer of technology would happen as 126 rafale fighter jets would be manufactured in india.reports suggest that the need for reworking the rafale deal arose as the french company refused to share its technology with the hal saying that the indian firm was not equipped to handle its technology of the fighter jets. this development happened after the exit of upa government.the new modi government insisted that rafale dassault must take responsibility of maintaining quality standards of the fighter jets. rafale was not ready to accept the condition necessitating a revisit of the terms and conditions negotiated during upa government.now, iaf chief dhanoa has said that ""technology may not be going to the hindustan aeronautics ltd (hal) but it is coming to the defence research and development organisation (drdo) and then to a lot of indians.""cost variationthe upa government had agreed to calculate the price of the rafale deal on a formula that allowed the company to include an additional cost of 3.9 per cent inflation indices from the day deal was struck. under the reworked deal, cost escalation rate has been fixed and limited to a maximum of 3.5 per cent. the government claims to have saved around usd 200 million by lowering the cost escalation rate.there was another factor that has led to confusion about the costing of the deal. during the upa regime, the negotiators had agreed for the proposal of manufacturing 108 rafale fighter jets in india.check out 'myth vs fact' on rafale procurement for the iaf. pic.twitter.com/tcc7xx9q1s- bjp (@bjp4india) november 18, 2017later it was found that the cost of industry manhours was 2.7 times higher at hal in india than in rafale in france. this variation was expected to have pushed per unit cost of the fighter plane in india by about rs 150 crore.this is believed to be the reason for a file noting made by the then defence minister ak antony stating that the negotiating team must consult him before finalising the contract with rafale.what else?under the reworked deal, the rafale is bound to offset 50 per cent of its earnings, from the sale of fighter jets to india, in the defence sector of the country. this was not discussed in the original deal.the rafale is also obliged to provide 3 crore industry manhour for production of fighter planes in india under make in india programme. the rafale experts will be working with the professionals of the hal in india sharing their expertise and technological know how.further, the rafale dassault has to keep 75 per cent of the total strength of the fighter jets in operational condition at any point of time for the first five years. this is significant improvement from the standard operational condition maintained for sukhoi or other fighter planes.at present, only 60 per cent of sukhoi-30 fleet remains operational at a given point of time. according to some defence analysts, it was only 48 per cent till 2013.",0.09281218781218778,bjp vs

2018-07-20,"pm mocks rahul's 'hug-and-wink', asks why in hurry to get pm's seat","(eds: updating with more quotes) new delhi, july 20 (pti) in a blistering rebuttal, prime minister narendra modi today mocked rahul gandhi for gesturing him to stand from the seat before the now-famous hug, saying the congress leader was in a hurry to unseat him and grab the pm's chair, as he dubbed the no-trust vote an act of ""arrogance"". modi also dared the opposition to bring a no-confidence motion against his government again in 2024 -- a remark seen as his confidence in returning to power next year -- as he gave a point-by-point retort to the charges levelled by gandhi. during his nearly one-and-half hour long reply to the congress leader's hug-capped scathing attack, modi also took a dig at the congress president's apparent post-hug wink in parliament saying the entire nation saw what the eyes did today, as he made gestures with his hands and eyes to show gandhi's action. gandhi's hug to modi and the subsequent 'wink' after coming back to his seat prompted a furious discussion about the appropriateness of his actions, even as the modi government won the trust vote by 325-126 votes after a 12-hour long debate. replying to the no-confidence motion moved by the bjp's former ally tdp and supported by congress among other opposition parties, modi said only the 125 crore people of the country can decide who would sit in the prime minister's chair or who can be unseated. ""what is the hurry,"" modi said, while referring to gandhi's hand gestures when he came across to pm's chair and hugged him during the non-confidence motion debate. modi looked nonplussed initially and did not stand up, but recovered quickly and called gandhi back and patted him on the back. in another swipe at gandhi's apparent slip of tongue in saying that the prime minister could not see him eye-to-eye, modi said, ""you are a 'naamdaar' (known by name) and i am 'kaamdar' (known by work). i cannot dare see you eye-to-eye."" the prime minister went on to list names of leaders like sardar patel, subhash chandra bose, chandra shekhar and pranab mukherjee who he said tried to see eye-to-eye with the congress and the result is known to everyone. referring to the dokalam stand-off, he said, ""when the whole country was united at the time of dokalam, you (gandhi) met the chinese envoy."" on gandhi's allegations on the rafale aircraft deal, he said ""we must abstain from making childish statements on sensitive issues."" he also termed the surgical strikes being described as 'jumla strike' an insult to the security forces. in his reply, modi asked all lok sabha members to dismiss the non-confidence motion, which he said was driven by arrogance and congress' attempt to test its own probable allies. ""arrogance is behind the no confidence motion,"" modi said and hit out at the congress, saying this is not the floor test of the government but a ""force"" test of the main opposition party and its so-called allies. modi also hit out at gandhi's ""bhagidar"" (collaborator) remark, saying he is a 'chowkidar' and a 'bhagidar', but not a 'saudagar' (trader) or 'thekedar' (contractor) like the congress president. rahul had said an industrialist under a debt of rs 35,000 crore was given a contract in the rafale deal and he benefitted to the tune of rs 45,000 crore, while asking the prime minister to answer if the cabinet committee on security took the decision.asserting that some people are indulging in ""negative"" politics, modi said he was not doing politics of appeasement or vote bank. ""we have been working with 'sabka saath sabka vikas' mantra,"" he said. modi said the nda government has done several things for the benefit of the people, but the opposition does not believe in the facts. ""we are taking steps for doubling the income of farmers by 2022,"" he said. the prime minister said the opposition, especially the congress does not trust the chief justice of india, the election commission and the electronic voting machines. he said ""those who dont have confidence in themselves, cannot trust anyone."" ""i pray to god to give you the strength to bring a no- confidence motion in 2024 also. my best wishes are with you"", modi said. he said the major opposition party had brought the no-trust motion ""to spread instability in the country."" ""had it not been your arrogance, and had you understood the problems of the states, gst would have been implemented five years ago,"" the prime minister said. the prime minister also condemned the incidents of rape and atrocities against women and said ""any instance of violence brings shame to the nation. ""i will once again urge the state governments to punish those who indulge in violence,"" modi said in an apparent reference to the cases of mob lynching and assured that his government stood with the muslim women in their quest for justice. he blamed the congress for division of the country at the time of the independence, as also for division of andhra pradesh in a manner which had left the people there unhappy. modi said when the tdp decided to pull out of nda, he had warned its leader n chandrababu naidu that his party was ""getting entangled in a race of one-upmanship with the ysr congress. modi said the nda government is committed towards the development of andhra pradesh and telangana. he said the government of atal bihari vajpayee had created uttarakhand, chhattisgarh and jharkhand.

""any instance of violence brings shame to the nation. i will once again urge the state governments to punish those who indulge in violence,"" he said.earlier, rahul gandhi had written to pm modi asking him to get the women's reservation bill passed. the bjp had sought to turn the tables on the congress by asking it to support the government in the passage of bills on instant triple talaq and nikah halala along with the one on women's reservation.

2018-08-30,why rahul gandhi wants a jpc probe into rafale deal,"it was february 22, 2011 - the first day of the budget session when upa was in power. the then prime minister manmohan singh announced setting up of a joint parliamentary committee (jpc) into the alleged multi-crore 2g spectrum allocation scam. for the next three years till the 2014 lok sabha election, 2g had become one of the most important issues for the bjp to corner the ruling congress-led upa government.in a reversal of roles now, the congress is demanding a jpc probe into the rafale deal. congress president rahul gandhi has upped the ante over the issue. the ruling bjp has so far shown no inkling of giving in to rahul gandhis demand.why is rahul gandhi demanding a jpc probe into the rafale deal? what gains will the probe accrue to him and the congress party?if one looks at the history of all jpcs, one finds that they serve as an important political tool for the opposition party. so far, jpcs have been constituted on six occasions - bofors scam (1987), harshad mehta stock market scam (1992), ketan parekh share market scam (2001), soft drink pesticide issue (2003), 2g spectrum allocation scam (2011) and vvip chopper scam (2013).while jpc was first constituted in the bofors scandal when rajiv gandhi was the prime minister, the last two jpcs, including the one on 2g spectrum allocation, were formed during manmohan singhs second tenure as pm. coincidentally, every time that the jpc has been constituted, the government of the day has lost in the next lok sabha election.from the oppositions point of view, these are some of the five advantages of a jpc:building up heatany jpc inquiry helps the opposition in building up the heat on the ruling party of the day. the 2g did exactly that for the then main opposition party, the bjp. the congress and its upa partners were put on the defensive.the bjp kept demanding a jpc probe into 2g spectrum scam. when it was finally constituted, it remained in the news because if its meetings. documents and heated arguments during its meetings would also be leaked thus keeping the pot boiling all the time. the congress, therefore, wants the bjp to face the heat through a jpc on the rafale deal.read | rahul gandhi on rafale: we don't take pm modi seriously but expose his liesofficial sanctiona jpc probe provides an official sanction to an alleged scam. the bjp was luckier than the congress. the 2g spectrum scam found mention in comptroller and auditor generals report which pegged the loss at rs 1.76 lakh crore to the exchequer. the scam was probed by the cbi under the watch of the supreme court. the rafale deal has not been taken up by any of these bodies. in the absence of such factor, rahul gandhi and the congress may want a jpc inquiry for the rafale deal to get some kind of an official sanction.make scam stick to bjpwhatever may have been the truth in the bofors, 2g spectrum or the vvip chopper scams, they have got associated with the congress governments of the day. the jpc probe had a big role to play in all of these.the opposition parties, vp singhs janata dal and the bjp respectively, were successful in creating a perception among the people of wrongdoings by the government. the jpc probe came in handy for the opposition.if the congress succeeds in getting a jpc inquiry ordered, it would go to town with the deliberations of the jpc meetings and finally its report and all the controversies surrounding it.disrupting parliamentrahul gandhis demand for a jpc probe into the rafale deal may be a precursor to the worse things to come. it may be an alibi to disrupt the winter session of parliament. the whole winter session of parliament in 2010 had got washed out with the bjp demanding a jpc probe into the 2g scam. though the bjp created the ruckus, the ruling congress felt the heat.to escape any further embarrassment, the then pm manmohan singh announced the formation of jpc on 2g spectrum scam on the very first day of the 2011 budget session. the jpc meetings went on till more than two years and finally, its report was submitted by its chairman pc chacko to the then lok sabha speaker meira kumar on october 29, 2013.parliament was disrupted even on the adoption of the report. one may expect the same if a jpc probe is ordered into the rafale deal.electoral dividendfinally, the main motive. the bjp was successful in creating a perception about the congress government being corrupt. the jpc probe into the 2g spectrum scam played a key role. it provided a legitimacy for the bjp which went to the 2014 lok sabha election painting the congress-led upa government as corrupt. it paid rich dividends and the congress fared the worst in history winning just 44 of the 543 lok sabha seats.with no other scam having stuck to the narendra modi government so far, the congress smells a chance in the rafale deal. rahul gandhi has been trying to rake it up on all forums.now, his emphasis is on ensuring that a jpc is ordered into it so that he harvests its yield in the 2019 lok sabha election. presently, the bjp seems to have smelt the congress gameplan. hence, both finance minister arun jaitley and bjp president amit shah had outrightly rejected any jpc probe. the tug of war over jpc on rafale deal would be interesting in the days to come.read | arun jaitley says rahul gandhi peddling untruth on rafale deal, asks 15 questionswatch | demonetisation helped big businesses, ruined small ones: rahul gandhi",0.113,rahul gandhi wants jpc probe rafale deal,"february 22 , 2011 -

2018-09-03,how no pil into rafale deal robs rahul gandhi of credibility,"last week congress president rahul gandhi aggressively demanded an inquiry into the rafale deal by a joint parliamentary committee (jpc). however, the bjp and the modi government, while mocking him, not just rejected his demand but also treated it with utmost contempt.the reason for the ruling bjp's casual approach towards rahul gandhi's vociferous demand for a jpc probe into the rafale deal may be the absence of an official sanction.so far, the controversies surrounding the rafale deal are confined to the realm of accusations and allegations with no single word or letter from any official agency. in such a scenario, rahul gandhi's fulminations are bereft of any seriousness.rahul gandhi's demand for a jpc inquiry would have been taken seriously by the ruling bjp had it followed some indicting report from any official agency or filing of pil in the supreme court.for instance, the 2g spectrum and the coal block allocation scams during the congress-led upa regime were first revealed by the comptroller and auditor general's (cag) office. this was followed by pils in the supreme court which ordered inquiry by the cbi and even monitored it.in the allegations of large-scale bungling in the 2010 commonwealth games (cwg), an inquiry was held by the shunglu committee. this was followed by action against cwg organising committee chairman suresh kalmadi who was sent to jail.however, no such development has taken place in the case of the rafale deal so far.neither any agency has taken cognisance of the rafale deal so far nor any criminal case has been lodged and nor a pil has been filed in the matter.subsequent to the indictment by the cag in the 2g spectrum and coal block allocation cases, senior advocate prashant bhushan filed pils in the supreme court.while supreme court was hearing the matter, the bjp, which was the main opposition party, made a concerted demand in parliament for a jpc probe into the 2g spectrum case.with the backing of the cag and the matter being heard by the supreme court, the bjp perhaps got emboldened and upped its ante over its demand for a jpc probe. that strategy did work for the bjp.however, what rahul gandhi is doing may be termed as putting the cart before the horse.with no official agency having taken up the rafale deal as yet nor any pil having been filed in the supreme court, rahul gandhi's demand for a jpc probe seems to be a bit premature.prashant bhushan, who generally files a pil in corruption cases with prompt, is not seen equally excited in the rafale deal.prashant bhushan is on record stating that he had not yet made up his mind to file a pil in the rafale deal. addressing a press conference in ranchi on august 26, he said one has to think before taking any case to the supreme court as ""there is rampant corruption in the apex court"". this was the reason why he was undecided about taking the issue to the court, he added.with no help coming from lawyers either, rahul gandhi seems to be fighting a lone battle. on the one hand he lacks credibility, on the other hand he is being attacked by the bjp and the modi

2018-09-12,concept of grand alliance is a myth created by media: randeep surjewala to india today,"at a time when congress has been trying to corner the narendra modi-led bjp government over price rise and alleged corruption, former rbi governor raghuram rajan dropped a bombshell -- most bad loans were sanctioned under upa government between 2006 and 2008. this came as a big blow to the congress narrative of modi government helping big defaulters such as vijay mallya, nirav modi and mehul choksi.in an interview with kaushik deka, congress communication in-charge randeep singh surjewala explains congress's position on rajan's revelation and several other issues such as the party's new hindu avatar, brahmin dna and the plan of grand alliance against bjp in 2019 lok sabha elections.q. raghuram rajan has said that npa of banks surged the highest between 2006 and 2008 under upa government. this is a serious charge.when modi took charge the npas were rs 2.80 lakh crore. today it has grown to rs 12 lakh crore. let prime minister modi explain this surge. why did he waive off huge amount of loan of about a dozen industrialists? why did allow bank frauds of 1 lakh crore happen in last one year?q. you are criticising the government on fuel price hike. but fuel prices continued to soar under upa government too?the government has said that it is helpless. it's a white lie. the government has accumulated rs 11 lakh crore by imposing additional central excise and customs duty on fuel. on may 16, 2014, crude oil was selling at $107 per barrel, now it has dropped to less than $65 per barrel. why is the government reluctant to pass on the benefits to the consumers? bjp and allies are ruling most indian states where vat rates are high. why are these governments not reducing the tax? why can't petrol and diesel be brought under gst? why is the modi government not rolling back excise duty hike and customs duty, which was non-existent earlier? during upa's tenure, when global crude oil prices went up, we had asked congress-ruled states to reduce vat. we had reduced excise duty and done away with customs duty.q. but the government claims the extra tax collection helped it to pay back over rs 2 lakh crore, including rs 70,000 crore interest, which was taken as a loan through oil bonds by the by the upa. the oil bonds were worth rs 43,000 crore. how can you collect rs 11 lakh crore to repay rs 43,000 crore?q. you have alleged that there was a scam in the rafale deal. but there is no proof of any bribery or kickback in the deal. your primary allegation is that the government paid more money than the upa had proposed. besides, congress president rahul gandhi has quoted three different prices.let the modi government correct him by revealing the actual price.q. you claim modi government is corrupt. but rahul gandhi and upa chairperson sonia gandhi are out on bail. there is an income tax notice also against them. there is an fir against former haryana chief minister bs hooda and sonia gandhi's son-in-law robert vadra.all three cases are bogus and filed with malafide intentions. our leaders will come clean in the court of law. the government has failed to prove any allegations. in the run up to the 2019 elections, it's bjp's tactic to intimidate and harass the opposition leaders and divert attention from their mistakes and failures.q. what do you mean when you say congress has brahmin dna. you have demanded reservation for brahmins. why is this sudden love for brahmins?in haryana, which is an agrarian state, the land holdings among brahmins have reduced to this extent that agriculture is no more a sustainable profession for them. brahmins were always considered to be a forward community. but today they face a lot of economic challenges. there is a need to promote and protect the interest of the brahmins.q. are you not practicing caste politics? congress has espoused the causes of every section of the society. we brought in the concept of reservation for dalits and backward classes. why is it wrong if we talk about the welfare of brahmins?q. rahul gandhi has visited kailash mansarovar. shashi tharoor has written a book on hinduism. kamal nath has promised gaushala in every district of madhya pradesh. is not the congress trying to usurp hindutva agenda from bjp?rahul gandhi is a shiv bhakt. he has never hidden it. as an indian, he recognises and realises that it is our duty to ensure that every section of minority community has the right to practice their faith. that's what hinduism is all about. it's all encompassing and is founded upon assimilation and tolerance. this philosophy of hinduism has been corrupted for political gains by the bjp. that is something we need to fight. congress is defending india's civilisational values while bjp is trying to force down its myopic and parochial views on all indians.q. shashi tharoor said bjp would make india a hindu pakistan. rahul gandhi equated rss with muslim brotherhood. what's your stand on these two statements? tharoor's intent was right but phraseology was not correct. that's why party has suggested that we should be careful in choosing our words. rahul gandhi is 100 per cent correct about his assessment of rss. bjp president amit shah's claim that the party will stay in power for next 50 years proves that the intent is clear -- to annihilate democracy.q. you are talking about a grand alliance. nitish kumar and kcr left you. bjd has maintained a safe distance. you have not been able to stitch a partnership with bsp in three poll-bound states yet. where is the alliance?the entire concept of so-called grand alliance is myth created by media. congress believes we are extremely strong in several states of the country and we will be able to take on the bjp on our own. in several states we have existing coalition -- with rjd in bihar, dmk in tamil nadu, ncp in maharashtra, jd (s) in karnataka, nc in jammu and kashmir and several others in kerala. we now have to decide about our coalition partner in uttar pradesh and west bengal. we will formalise an alliance in these two states in next 30-60 days.",0.05858569208569209,concept grand alliance myth created media : randeep surjewala india today,"time congress trying corner narendra modi-led bjp government price rise alleged corruption , former rbi governor raghuram rajan dropped bombshell -- bad loans sanctioned upa government 2006 2008. came big blow congress narrative modi government helping big defaulters vijay mallya , nirav modi mehul choksi.in interview kaushik deka , congress communication in-charge randeep singh surjewala explains congress ' position rajan ' revelation several issues party ' new hindu avatar , brahmin dna plan grand alliance bjp 2019 lok sabha elections.q. raghuram rajan said npa banks surged highest 2006 2008 upa government. serious charge.when modi took charge npas rs 2.80 lakh crore. today grown rs 12 lakh crore. let prime minister modi explain surge. waive huge amount loan dozen industrialists ?

prime minister narendra modi of being ""corrupt"" and the ruling party alleging that pressure for ""extraneous considerations"" during the upa rule did not allow the contract to be finalised.questioning the prime minister's ""silence"" on the rafale issue, congress president gandhi asked him to come clean on the charge of favouring reliance defence in the deal, saying it is the question of dignity of his office and he should speak up on what former french president francois hollande has said.he also demanded a probe by a joint parliamentary committee (jpc), in which hollande can be called.""now, what the ex-president of france is saying is that the prime minister of india is a 'thief'. that is what this (hollande's) statement is saying.""it is very important for the prime minister of india now to either accept mr hollande's statement and say 'yes, it is the truth -- mr narendra modi gave the rafale contract in rs 30,000 crore to mr anil ambani', or 'mr hollande is not telling the truth and here is the truth',"" gandhi said at a press conference.coming out in modi's defence, union law minister ravi shankar prasad condemned gandhi's remarks as ""shameful and irresponsible"" and said no president of any party in independent india has ever used such language against a prime minister.the charges flew thick and fast from both sides, with the congress and the bjp holding press conferences in quick succession.soon after gandhi's presser, the bjp held a press conference by prasad after which congress chief spokesperson randeep surjewala also briefed reporters.the sharp attacks by the congress continued a day after hollande was quoted as saying by french media that the indian government proposed anil ambani's reliance defence as the partner for dassault aviation in the fighter jet deal.""it is very important that the prime minister makes it very clear what his position is. it is the question of the dignity of the office of the prime minister, it is the question, it is a defence related question, it is the question of future of our jawans’, the future of our soldiers, the future of our air force,"" gandhi said expressing surprise at modi's silence on the charges made by none other than a former french president.the congress chief, alleging a ""clear cut"" and ""cent percent"" corruption"" in the rafale deal, said, ""we are absolutely convinced that the prime minister of india is corrupt.""""this question is now clearly settled into the minds of the indian people that the country's watchman is a thief,"" he said.this was strongly rebutted by prasad, saying, ""we cannot expect anything better from gandhi. he has no quality, no capability and whatever he is he owes to his family... modi is a symbol of honesty and a global leader.""he said no prime minister of india has been spoken of in a manner gandhi did about modi, condemning his comments as ""irresponsible and shameful"" and that he had painted his face black with such remarks.the bjp leader said dassault and reliance had entered into an agreement as early as 2012 when the congress-led upa was in power as he refuted the charge that the modi government favoured the anil ambani-led company.hitting back at prasad, congress spokesperson surjewala said ""obfuscation, subterfuge and smokescreens"" would not cover the ""tracks of corruption"" and the ""house of lies and pack of canards"" would not derail the truth.""faced with truth on rafale scam, modiji's 'court jesters and pack of liars' are deeply unnerved, agitated and frustrated. abuse and subterfuge are the only weapons left in the armoury of the 'house of lies'.""a peeved and flummoxed law minister ravi shankar prasad, who has been a counsel for anil ambani in the past, dished out a cacophony of slander and calumny to vent out his frustration and has tied himself in knots in verbal diarrhea of lies,"" he said.prasad also alleged that there was pressure for ""extraneous considerations"" and bribe in the deal during the upa rule that did not see it finalised despite years of negotiations, a charge denied by the congress.however, surjewala claimed it was the bjp that tried to stall the deal by raising the issue of life cycle cost of the aircraft.it was the saffron party that demanded bribe and later took the same when the deal was finalised, as cost of rafale was three times higher than what the upa had finalised, he alleged.demanding a joint parliamentary committee probe into the deal, gandhi said finance minister arun jaitley ""has written a very good blog, but when it came to the jpc demand, he went silent. let there be a jpc, we can call hollande also in it and everything will be known"".hollande was quoted as saying, ""it was indian

2018-10-19,"pse: arvind kejriwal, amarinder singh rank high as cms of delhi, punjab respectively","india today's political stock exchange (pse) has revealed delhi chief minister arvind kejriwal and his punjab counterpart amarinder singh scored well on the popularity chart. kejriwal stood unbeatable as the preferred choice for the next cm of the capital, with 47 per cent of respondents supporting the aam aadmi party (aap) supremo, while 42 per cent gave a thumbs-up to captain amarinder in punjab, the survey showed.the aap government in delhi also gained on the performance scale. however, the poll findings threw up a confusing picture in punjab as most respondents expressed dissatisfaction with the state's congress government. on the choice of the next prime minister, narendra modi was ahead of rahul gandhi in delhi but the pm trailed behind the congress president in punjab.pse - the first-ever weekly tracker of the country's political pulse - showed more than 40 per cent of respondents were satisfied with the aap administration's performance. thirty five per cent expressed their dissatisfaction in the poll. kejriwal's predecessor sheila dikshit was the second choice for the next chief minister of delhi, however, she managed a meagre 19 per cent. drainage and fuel price hikeaccording to the pse survey, drainage and cleanliness emerged as the top concern for residents of delhi who confront water-logging every monsoon. drinking water and pollution were other issues raised by the respondents. thirty eight per cent blamed the central government for rising fuel prices, while 22 per cent held both the state and the centre responsible for the hikes.rafale rowin what came as a shocking revelation from the seat of power that is delhi, more than 60 per cent of residents were unaware of the rafale deal, according to the pse. among those who were aware, 63 per cent ticked the ""don't-know"" box when asked if they suspected corruption in the purchase of fighter jets from france.modi versus rahul for top job of pmwhen asked who should be the next prime minister, 49 per cent respondents supported pm narendra modi while 43 per cent backed congress president rahul gandhi for the top job.political analyst ashutosh, a former aap leader, agreed that the kejriwal government won public support for improving utility, health and education services. ""four factors which have gone in favour of the aap government are bijli, pani, education and health. in these four sectors, i think, the aap government has done exceptionally well,"" he said.""electricity and water have certainly satisfied a large section of the people who live below the poverty line and who have migrated from bihar and other places.""psephologist yogendra yadav, however, differed, saying the pse findings suggested the aap government had been moderately successful and that it faces no real opposition. ""i would say it's a moderate, somewhat modest, success,"" yadav said. ""in many ways, the fact remains that there's virtually no opposition. the bjp has had spectacular success in the mcd elections, great success in the lok sabha elections. today, they have no leader; they have no agenda.... congress seemed to have been coming back but then it seemed to have fallen to its own internal machinations,"" he added.the bjp's sambit patra accused aap of a dictatorial style of functioning. ""the aap is almost imploding from within. in a democracy as great as india, it can never be a one-man party and that's what the aap has reduced itself to,"" he alleged.aap leader adarsh shastri said his party's government has its focus fixed on basic issues. ""popularity levels when you form the government and when you are an incumbent keep moving,"" shastri remarked. ""what is important here is that kejriwal has continued to focus on what is required by the people -- correcting infrastructure, health system and solving problems of electricity and water.""previous electionsin the 70-member assembly, kejriwal's aap swept the 2015 elections, securing 67 seats. the bjp won the remainder. the pse study was based on telephone interviews across seven parliamentary constituencies of delhi, with a sample size of 2,845.captain amarinder for punjab cmabout 45 per cent ofrespondents voiced their dissatisfaction with the amarinder singh government. on the question of who should be the next cm of punjab, captain amarinder bagged the top spot followed by parkash singh badal of the shiromani akali dal.twenty-nine per cent of respondents supported 91-year-old parkash singh badal while his son, sukhbir singh badal, fell behind with a meagre support base of 12 per cent, according to the poll.unemployment biggest worry in punjabunemployment is hitting punjab residents the hardest followed by price rise, sanitation and farm-related issues, the survey showed. fifty per cent respondents blamed both the state and the central governments for high fuel prices.the pse found rahul surpassing modi as punjab's choice for the next prime minister, securing 36 per cent votes, four per cent more than the pm's.""people want amarinder singh to be the next cm. this is one of the states where the chief ministerial candidate was announced before the elections,"" said punjab congress chief sunil kumar jakhar. ""we are the only state where we have promised loan waiver, and we have started delivering on it. the government could have delayed it till the elections,"" he added.on his part, ashutosh maintained that aap has lost its ground in the state.
