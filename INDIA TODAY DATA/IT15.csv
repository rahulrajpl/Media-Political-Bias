2010-05-04,'radia lobbied to get raja telecom ministry'," union communications minister a. raja has been caught on tape lobbying with a corporate pr agent for a place in the manmohan singh cabinet during the second term of the upa.headlines today is in exclusive possession of taped conversations between raja and powerful corporate lobbyist nira radia just days before the swearing-in of the cabinet.the conversations, which were recorded by investigators for the income tax department, raise serious issues about ministerial propriety. the income tax sleuths had sought permission to tap the telephone of radia, who was being investigated by the cbi and the income tax department in the telecom spectrum scam. radia is one of india's most influential power-brokers and has the biggest corporates of india as clients. these conversations were recorded over 300 days, starting from august 20, 2008. raja was lobbying hard to become the next telecom minister and was being helped in this endeavour by radia. here are excerpts from a conversation recorded on may 24, 2009 at 11.05 am. raja: my name is cleared?radia: yeah, your case was cleared last night itself. no, what is happening with daya?raja: textiles or fertilisers?radia: not for daya though, azhagiri or daya only one can come in?raja: no, two can come...radia: both?radia: baalu, will be the problem, i hope.radia: it will be difficult for the leader to justify three family members.raja: (laughs) yeah, but everybody knows...radia: no she said that, kani told me last night, that is what her father told her yesterday, that for him to justify three family members would be very difficult; he recognises that problem...raja: let us see what we can do...let us fight.this was how radia informed raja that his name had been cleared for the telecom minister's post. the conversation had been recorded just four days before raja's name was officially announced as the upa's telecom minister. so how does a corporate lobbyist get to know who is getting which portfolio? and why was raja discussing portfolios with a corporate lobbyist?not just raja, the tapes have radia talking to dmk chief m. karunanidhi's daughter kanimozhi as well. in these conversations, kanimozhi - referred to as kani - is heard telling radia that the dmk must get the telecom portfolio. here are excerpts from the conversation recorded on may 21, 2009 at 8:41 pm. kani: helloradia: pm has already clarified that the deal has not been done. they are still in the middle of discussing it. kani: they've already promised to give us telecom...but it cannot become that they shift...radia: what?kani: they have already told us that they will give us telecom. now it shouldn't be given to him because he's going around planting stories. radia: he's planting it on all the channels while you were on the plane.kani: ya i know that. radia: but kanni, the pm has just made a statement that i have no problems with raja and baalu and they are my esteemed colleagues. kani: he can make a statement. but whoever's going to come and talk to dad shouldn't talk otherwise.. see what people say outside and what actually they mean is different... and all of us know that in politics. not just telecom, radia and kanimozhi had a long conversation about who is getting what portfolio. what was surprising is that radia seemed to know exactly what is happening and who was getting which portfolio. here are more excerpts from the conversations:radia: kani there's feedback from the congress. they say we recognise that the problem with the dmk is an internal problem. it's a problem between the family. it's a problem between their own people. they have given us a list of five people. this is not acceptable to us.kani: yaradia: it is for them to resolve. we have told them what is the best that we can do.kani: three and four...radia: we appreciate that the dialogue has broken down but it is not for us to get back to them. as far as we are concerned, maran has been calling ghulam nabi azad on the half hour demanding all sorts of things and they have told him that there is no point in you calling us.kani: but what is the demand he's got.radia: he has been making the same demands that you give us five portfolios or we will not join or give us railways, otherwise he has also demanded coal and mines. so they are saying as far as we are concerned this is an internal dmk problem. it has nothing to do with the congress at all. they have taken a decision that it is for karuna to decide who he wants and who he doesn't want in the formula. that has been provided to him. it's up to karuna to decide but they feel that there are far too many people calling him including maran.the question is, is it proper for a senior leader of the dmk and a minister in the past upa government to be talking to a known corporate lobbyist? why is it that the lobbyist seems to know everything about the allocation of portfolios, and long before the information is made public?",0.020895061728395056,' radia lobbied get raja telecom ministry ',"union communications minister a. raja caught tape lobbying corporate pr agent place manmohan singh cabinet second term upa.headlines today exclusive possession taped conversations raja powerful corporate lobbyist nira radia days swearing-in cabinet.the conversations , recorded investigators income tax department , raise serious issues ministerial propriety. income tax sleuths sought permission tap telephone radia , investigated cbi income tax department telecom spectrum scam. radia one india ' influential power-brokers biggest corporates india clients. conversations recorded 300 days , starting august 20 , 2008. raja lobbying hard become next telecom minister helped endeavour radia. excerpts conversation recorded may 24 , 2009 11.05 am. raja : name cleared?radia : yeah , case cleared last night itself. , happening daya?raja : textiles fertilisers?radia : daya though , azhagiri daya one come in?raja : , two come ... radia : both?radia : baalu , problem , hope.radia : difficult leader justify three family members.raja : ( laughs ) yeah , everybody knows ... radia : said , kani told last night , father told yesterday , justify three family members would difficult ; recognises problem ... raja : let us see ... let us fight.this radia informed raja name cleared telecom minister ' post. conversation recorded four days raja ' name officially announced upa ' telecom minister. corporate lobbyist get know getting portfolio ?

all the tenders and contracts which have been sourced from various agencies and organisations, sources said.the department will primarily look for evasion of taxes, if any, by the way of over-invoicing and inflation of prices in the works related to the games including infrastructure projects, procurements and project planning, they said.the i-t department has got tender documents related to venue development and overlays, image and look, procurement, technology, accreditation, workforce, communication, risk management, finance and accounts, press operations, television rights, project planning and management related to the commonwealth games.it is also looking into financial estimates of real estate firms which have built the infrastructure like the games village buildings and other facilities.according to the sources, the department has sourced some initial reports of works from the chief vigilance officers (cvos) of various government departments which were involved in the commonwealth games before it initiates its search and survey operations on various stakeholders.the department will also probe the tds deductions on salaries paid to the professionals.the central board of direct taxes (cbdt) in 2008 had expanded the scope of 'professionals' under the income tax act, 1961 which included sportspersons, umpires, referees, coaches, trainers, team physicians and physiotherapists, event managers, commentators, anchors, and sports columnists and categorised their services as 'professional services.'such services are taxed in accordance with section 194j of the i-t act.the apex committee of the overall probes to be conducted by various agencies like the i-t department, cvc, cbi and enforcement directorate -- constituted by prime minister manmohan singh -- is headed by former comptroller and auditor general (cag) v k shunglu and will submit its report to him within three months.cvc asks for reports by month-endthe central vigilance commission (cvc), probing alleged financial irregularities in construction and procurement works related to the commonwealth games, has directed all agencies concerned to submit their reports by the month-end.official sources said a reminder has recently been issued to central public works department (cpwd), municipal corporation of delhi (mcd), delhi development authority (dda) and public works department (pwd) in this regard.the move came after central vigilance commissioner p j thomas objected to the ""lackadaisical approach"" and continuous delay by agencies in submitting replies to the queries raised by the anti-corruption watchdog, they said.""we have issued reminders to all the agencies and directed them to submit replies. they have been told to give point-wise answers to our queries by the end of october,"" a senior cvc official said.he said, based on their replies, the cvc will give its findings or final report to a committee formed by prime minister manmohan singh headed by former comptroller and auditor general (cag) of india v k shungloo.""all the chief vigilance officers (cvos) in the concerned organisations have been asked specifically to pursue the matter,"" the officer said.an analysis by chief technical examination wing of cvc has found alleged financial and administrative irregularities in 16 construction and procurement projects.six of them are being done by pwd, three by mcd, two each by cpwd, dda, ndmc and one by rites, a government of india enterprise, the cvc report said.according to the report, ""almost all the organisations executing works for commonwealth games have considered inadmissible factors to jack-up the reasonable price to justify award of work at quoted rates citing urgent or emergent circumstances.""the cvc has written a letter of complaint to cbi asking for a probe into alleged criminal conspiracy by unknown mcd officials in granting work for upgradation of street lighting in the national capital.meanwhile, the agency has also asked the cwg organising committee and the sports ministry to keep a sample of each items of the equipment and props hired from foreign suppliers for the games venues ready for its inspection.'no more tax burden on delhiites for cwg spending'delhiites can breathe easy as chief minister sheila dikshit has ruled out any new taxes to make up for expenses incurred on the commonwealth games which are estimated to have cost the nation a whopping rs 70,000 crore.""don't worry. you won't get any new tax... at least my very very firm opinion is that we don't need to increase taxes but there is a need to make our collection system more transparent and efficient,"" she told pti when asked whether more taxes would be levied in view of the huge expenses on the games.delhi government is facing serious fund crunch due to huge spending on infrastructure projects linked to the games.according to latest official estimates, about rs 15,000 crore were spent by the city government for improving infrastructure facilities ahead of the sporting extravaganza.tight cwg vigil helps cops stumble upon racketsthe heightened vigil by delhi police and central security agencies during the commonwealth games in the wake of terror threat had some interesting spin-offs--unearthing of human trafficking and hawala rackets and also a cross-border call girl link.with clear instructions from union home ministry not to ignore any input without verification, sources in the delhi police on sunday said the trail of some such inputs had a hilarious ending while some led to busting of hawala or human trafficking networks.in one such case, an input was received about a lady using a fictitious name during her telephone calls to a person in pakistan. the nature of the conversation was intimate in nature, the sources said.however, when the woman was informed by the service provider through a sms that she had been calling too frequently across the border, in the next call made by her she expressed apprehensions that she would be picked up and ""their plan will be washed away"".the delhi police swung into action suspecting her to be a woman recruit of some terror outfit. as she was questioned, it took a little time for the sleuths to understand that she was a call girl who had met the pakistani national in a gulf country, the sources said.the human trafficking racket which also included prostitution was busted mainly from badarpur area in the outskirts of south delhi and east delhi, the police sources said.during the intense vigil, which included two days of near shutdown in the national capital on october three and 14, police also stumbled upon new hawala rackets and a revived ""savari racket"".the ""savari racket"" was started by terrorist groups and isi in which poor people having relations across the border in pakistan are used for ferrying money and fake indian currency notes (ficn) into india through samjhauta express -- the only train link between india and pakistan.the police also unearathed rackets dealing with ficn and a few persons have been picked up for questioning.with inputs from

2010-10-28,honest pm presides over an era of corruption,"cynicism about the public realm, it can be said, is the only refuge of the well meaning in this country. how else does one contain frustration at the sight of thousands of crores of public money being misappropriated by the political and bureaucratic class working in cahoots with businessmen and traders?this was money that could have been used to build countless hospitals, homes and schools for the poor and set up infrastructure that improved the quality of life in india. and the irony of it all is that this has happened under the watch of prime minister manmohan singh, a man of great personal integrity.the commonwealth games provide only the latest instance of public loot that evokes cynicism.for you can be reasonably sure that notwithstanding the highprofile probes - initiated by the pm whose reputation can work as a shield for this government - that have been announced to unearth the irregularities, precious little action will take place at the end of it all - a gag order has already been issued to the investigative agencies against speaking to the media in connection with the inquiry.instancesas the villainous neta in our films says, ""kucch din me mamla thanda par jayega (the thing will die down in a while)''. once public attention shifts with time and a new scam is unearthed to arouse our outrage, the villains of the cwg drama will make their getaway.manmohan singh or no manmohan singh, the probe by our investigative agencies, whose poor credibility itself deserves to be probed, will sooner or later reach a dead end. it serves the interests of the ruling class that it turns out this way.for many more people belonging to it are likely to have had a share in the cwg loot than the names being bandied about - for instance, with the cabinet secretary as the nodal officer for the games, the top echelons of power were all along in the know about what was going on.it has not been remarked enough that two humongous scams have surfaced during the upa regime.the first, the 2g spectrum scam was said to be worth rs 60,000 crore and the games cost the nation upwards of `70,000 crore. post-cwg, the transparency international says, india's global ranking on perceived corruption has dipped to 87 in a list comprising 178 countries.see this from the standpoint of the prime minister whose integrity is tomtommed by his party and you will be forgiven for asking what dr singh's integrity is worth as far as the country is concerned.worth there certainly must be in an honest man leading what is certainly a hugely corrupt nation but the degree of that worth is worth discusssing.it is possible that dr singh's clean record has had some effect on the way this government is run but as far as the observer watching from the stands is concerned he has reasons to be disappointed. take two or three well known examples.the central vigilance commission - whose functioning already leaves a lot to be desired - is the top anti-corruption agency of the government and is supposed to be headed by an individual with impeccable credentials.while appointing the new cvc some time ago, the leader of the opposition in the lok sabha expressed strong reservations about the candidate whose name the government was pushing and this with justifiable reason.this individual was the telecom secretary when the 2g spectrum scam was orchestrated - this was not the only factor that should have worked against his candidature.but the appointments committee led by our honourable prime minister rammed through the particular bureaucrat's candidature, reducing the bipartisan appointment exercise to a virtual farce. take also the functioning of the central bureau of investigation (cbi) which often probes cases of public corruption.right since the first united progressive alliance government came to power, the cbi has been systematically abused by the government to either settle scores with a political opponent or buttress its parliamentary strength and our honourable prime minister thinks nothing untoward about it.congresscountless corruption cases are pending against bureaucrats in this government that the investigative agencies cannot take forward for want of sanction to prosecute - the government's single directive virtually makes it impossible to initiate a corruption inquiry against top bureaucrats.it is fashionable these days to condone many grave irregularities as the compulsions of coalition politics.while it may be true that the presence in the government of regional parties that have their own agendas may somewhat tie the hands of the principal party, especially if the parliamentary arithmetic is fragile, this perception that all the wheeling-dealing in the upa government is being done by the allies is flawed.what better proof do we need of this than the example of the commonwealth games where the politicians calling the shots were all from the ruling party?so the situation the prime minister has to reckon with also entails handling several congress ministers with their own agendas in which integrity does not have a prominent place.there is no denying that an honest prime minister's integrity in today's india must be assessed not by what he should have done but what he could have done under the circumstances.for, it would be nave to hold that an honest man in the hot seat can cleanse the system if he was of a mind to do so - such a man would either soon lose his job or his government its majority.at the same time, there is a need to take on corruption as a primary ill of governance, especially given the country's backwardness and the poverty that afflicts a huge chunk of its citizens.commitmentjudged against this benchmark, it is difficult to escape the perception that fighting corruption is not a priority for dr singh. he seems smug about the fact that he personally has claimed no share in the loot and conveniently looks the other way when people around him rob the state exchequer.a leader with a greater commitment to the cause could have worked around the hurdles he faces in this exercise by making a sincere effort to revitalise the state's institutions that act as a check against corruption.by granting such institutions complete autonomy - of the kind that the higher judiciary enjoys - a situation could have been created where the ruling government in delhi's powers to shield the corrupt was severely limited if not eliminated altogether.merely creating or strengthening such institutions would check corruption because it would send out the message that no influence with the powers-that-be would bail out a corrupt politician or bureaucrat once the investigative agencies got onto his trail. this kind of an agenda dr singh has shown little signs of pushing.he seems happy just running a government which enjoys stability and taking some good steps to ensure that his party has a reasonable chance of being voted back to power.and when the time comes to relinquish office, he will be referred to as the longest serving non-nehru/gandhi prime minister, who ran a coalition government successfully, that too with the economy growing fast enough in a time of meltdown.these will be achievements no doubt for our times. but so far as the worth of his personal integrity is concerned, it would be incorrect to say that he left governance any cleaner than it was when he donned the mantle of prime minister a good many years ago.in that sense, dr manmohan singh's integrity has failed the nation. and if we still find reason to hail it, it reflects nothing but the poor standards of public morality in this day and age. devbrat.chaudhary@mailtoday.in",0.1372766382112176,honest pm presides era corruption,"cynicism public realm , said , refuge well meaning country. else one contain frustration sight thousands crores public money misappropriated political bureaucratic class working cahoots businessmen traders?this money could used build countless hospitals , homes schools poor set infrastructure improved quality life india. irony happened watch prime minister manmohan singh , man great personal integrity.the commonwealth games provide latest instance public loot evokes cynicism.for reasonably sure notwithstanding highprofile probes -

2010-10-29,honest pm presides over an era of corruption,"cynicism about the public realm, it can be said, is the only refuge of the well meaning in this country. how else does one contain frustration at the sight of thousands of crores of public money being misappropriated by the political and bureaucratic class working in cahoots with businessmen and traders?this was money that could have been used to build countless hospitals, homes and schools for the poor and set up infrastructure that improved the quality of life in india. and the irony of it all is that this has happened under the watch of prime minister manmohan singh, a man of great personal integrity.the commonwealth games provide only the latest instance of public loot that evokes cynicism.for you can be reasonably sure that notwithstanding the highprofile probes - initiated by the pm whose reputation can work as a shield for this government - that have been announced to unearth the irregularities, precious little action will take place at the end of it all - a gag order has already been issued to the investigative agencies against speaking to the media in connection with the inquiry.instancesas the villainous neta in our films says, ""kucch din me mamla thanda par jayega (the thing will die down in a while)''. once public attention shifts with time and a new scam is unearthed to arouse our outrage, the villains of the cwg drama will make their getaway.manmohan singh or no manmohan singh, the probe by our investigative agencies, whose poor credibility itself deserves to be probed, will sooner or later reach a dead end. it serves the interests of the ruling class that it turns out this way.for many more people belonging to it are likely to have had a share in the cwg loot than the names being bandied about - for instance, with the cabinet secretary as the nodal officer for the games, the top echelons of power were all along in the know about what was going on.it has not been remarked enough that two humongous scams have surfaced during the upa regime.the first, the 2g spectrum scam was said to be worth rs 60,000 crore and the games cost the nation upwards of `70,000 crore. post-cwg, the transparency international says, india's global ranking on perceived corruption has dipped to 87 in a list comprising 178 countries.see this from the standpoint of the prime minister whose integrity is tomtommed by his party and you will be forgiven for asking what dr singh's integrity is worth as far as the country is concerned.worth there certainly must be in an honest man leading what is certainly a hugely corrupt nation but the degree of that worth is worth discusssing.it is possible that dr singh's clean record has had some effect on the way this government is run but as far as the observer watching from the stands is concerned he has reasons to be disappointed. take two or three well known examples.the central vigilance commission - whose functioning already leaves a lot to be desired - is the top anti-corruption agency of the government and is supposed to be headed by an individual with impeccable credentials.while appointing the new cvc some time ago, the leader of the opposition in the lok sabha expressed strong reservations about the candidate whose name the government was pushing and this with justifiable reason.this individual was the telecom secretary when the 2g spectrum scam was orchestrated - this was not the only factor that should have worked against his candidature.but the appointments committee led by our honourable prime minister rammed through the particular bureaucrat's candidature, reducing the bipartisan appointment exercise to a virtual farce. take also the functioning of the central bureau of investigation (cbi) which often probes cases of public corruption.right since the first united progressive alliance government came to power, the cbi has been systematically abused by the government to either settle scores with a political opponent or buttress its parliamentary strength and our honourable prime minister thinks nothing untoward about it.congresscountless corruption cases are pending against bureaucrats in this government that the investigative agencies cannot take forward for want of sanction to prosecute - the government's single directive virtually makes it impossible to initiate a corruption inquiry against top bureaucrats.it is fashionable these days to condone many grave irregularities as the compulsions of coalition politics.while it may be true that the presence in the government of regional parties that have their own agendas may somewhat tie the hands of the principal party, especially if the parliamentary arithmetic is fragile, this perception that all the wheeling-dealing in the upa government is being done by the allies is flawed.what better proof do we need of this than the example of the commonwealth games where the politicians calling the shots were all from the ruling party?so the situation the prime minister has to reckon with also entails handling several congress ministers with their own agendas in which integrity does not have a prominent place.there is no denying that an honest prime minister's integrity in today's india must be assessed not by what he should have done but what he could have done under the circumstances.for, it would be nave to hold that an honest man in the hot seat can cleanse the system if he was of a mind to do so - such a man would either soon lose his job or his government its majority.at the same time, there is a need to take on corruption as a primary ill of governance, especially given the country's backwardness and the poverty that afflicts a huge chunk of its citizens.commitmentjudged against this benchmark, it is difficult to escape the perception that fighting corruption is not a priority for dr singh. he seems smug about the fact that he personally has claimed no share in the loot and conveniently looks the other way when people around him rob the state exchequer.a leader with a greater commitment to the cause could have worked around the hurdles he faces in this exercise by making a sincere effort to revitalise the state's institutions that act as a check against corruption.by granting such institutions complete autonomy - of the kind that the higher judiciary enjoys - a situation could have been created where the ruling government in delhi's powers to shield the corrupt was severely limited if not eliminated altogether.merely creating or strengthening such institutions would check corruption because it would send out the message that no influence with the powers-that-be would bail out a corrupt politician or bureaucrat once the investigative agencies got onto his trail. this kind of an agenda dr singh has shown little signs of pushing.he seems happy just running a government which enjoys stability and taking some good steps to ensure that his party has a reasonable chance of being voted back to power.and when the time comes to relinquish office, he will be referred to as the longest serving non-nehru/gandhi prime minister, who ran a coalition government successfully, that too with the economy growing fast enough in a time of meltdown.these will be achievements no doubt for our times. but so far as the worth of his personal integrity is concerned, it would be incorrect to say that he left governance any cleaner than it was when he donned the mantle of prime minister a good many years ago.in that sense, dr manmohan singh's integrity has failed the nation. and if we still find reason to hail it, it reflects nothing but the poor standards of public morality in this day and age. devbrat.chaudhary@mailtoday.in",0.1372766382112176,honest pm presides era corruption,"cynicism public realm , said , refuge well meaning country. else one contain frustration sight thousands crores public money misappropriated political bureaucratic class working cahoots businessmen traders?this money could used build countless hospitals , homes schools poor set infrastructure improved quality life india. irony happened watch prime minister manmohan singh , man great personal integrity.the commonwealth games provide latest instance public loot evokes cynicism.for reasonably sure notwithstanding highprofile probes -

the prime minister brought the integrity standards to an all time low by forcing the appointment of then telecom secretary as cvc. if you (pm) are a man of integrity, then how will you remove this stain?"" the bjp leader said.the bjp also charged the prime minister with ""looking the other way"" when ""there was confirmed evidence of deliberate under-pricing of the 2g spectrum"" and questioned why he did not order a review the entire allocation process even when the government had earned huge revenue after the 3g spectrum auction earlier this year.""a scam of this magnitude cannot have taken place without the involvement of the then telecom minister and bureaucrats under him. we demand his arrest and of those who are involved in the financial bungling,"" prasad said.he read out a portion from raja's letter to the prime minister dated december 26, 2007 in which the axed minister blames the cellular operators association of india for filing cases in the delhi high court and said ""raja's reply that he was taking pre-emptive and pro-active decisions is baffling"".a united opposition led by bjp has not let parliament function this winter session so far mainly over the 2g spectrum allocation issue and has been vociferously demanding a joint parliamentary committee (jpc) probe into the matter.on the prime minister's appeal on saturday to all political parties to allow parliament to function and the ruling party was ready for a debate and discussion, prasad said ""we want to remind the prime minister that we have debated, re-debated and discussed. we want action and those responsible to the arrested under the prevention of corruption act"".he was also critical of finance minister pranab mukherjee for calling a meeting of opposition leaders for a solution on the issue and giving assurance that he would revert to them after consultation with the prime minister and ""till date he has not conveyed any formal proposal to enable the opposition to take a final view"".to a question if the bjp felt the issue of attorney general gulam vahanvati representing the prime minister in the supreme court in the 2g case after he had earlier represented a raja as a mater of conflict of interest, prasad said he would not like to comment on a lawyer's manner of conduct.taking another swipe at the prime minister, he raked up the issue of the supreme court seeking an explanation from the pmo over the contentious 2g issue and said, ""this must be the first time in the history of india when the supreme court has passed such a remark on a prime minister"".when asked to comment on janata party president subramanium swamy's allegation that even congress president sonia gandhi was in the know how of the 2g spectrum scam, prasad did not take any names but said ""it could not have happened without the patronage at the highest level"".''pm should clarify spectrum allocation''prime minister manmohan singh should give a clarification on the spectrum allocation irregularities in parliament and also constitute a jpc to inquire into the scam, the cpi(m) said on saturday.""parliament should be the forum where the prime minister should give his explanation,"" senior party leader sitaram yechury told reporters here.his statement came on a day when government filed an affidavit on behalf of the prime minister in supreme court rejecting charges of inaction by pmo in dealing with the request of sanction for prosecution of former telecom minister a raja in the 2g spectrum issue.""according to the constitutional scheme of things, it is the legislature which has to keep a vigil on the executive. and, therefore, this responsibility of legislature must be exercised,"" yechury said, indicating that the affidavit filed in the apex court would not suffice.'affidavit confirms all my issues on 2g spectrum'in dehra dun,janata party chief subramaniam swamy said the affidavit filed on behalf of prime minister manmohan singh in the supreme court confirms all issues he had raised on the 2g spectrum allocation and claimed he was now free to approach a lower court to seek prosecution of former telecom minister a raja.swamy also called for immediate cancellation of licenses issued through undervalued sale of 2g spectrum.

2010-11-20,2g: pranab to meet opposition leaders on monday,"senior congress leader pranab mukherjee will hold another round of discussions with the opposition on monday in yet another bid to break the logjam in parliament over the telecom scam.this was decided at a meeting of congress core group attended by prime minister manmohan singh and party president sonia gandhi as parliament meets on monday after a virtual washout for the last two weeks.bjp, left and other opposition parties have been demanding setting up of a joint parliamentary committee (jpc) probe on the basis of the cag report which spoke of a loss of rs.1.76 lakh crore to the exchequer in the 2g spectrum allocation.finance minister pranab mukherjee, home minister p chidambaram and defence minister a k antony were among those who attended the meeting at prime minister's race course road residence.sources said the party is keeping a close watch on the developments in bjp-ruled karnataka, where chief minister b s yeddyurappa is under pressure to to step down following the controversy over allotment of prime land to his sons.congress has so far been daring the bjp to take action against yeddyurappa to puncture the opposition's attack on the government over the spectrum scam.but there is a view in the party that this space for congress will shrink if yeddyurappa goes.a section of congress is of the view that the demand for jpc into the 2g issue should be accepted but its mandate should not be confined to only upa's period and the decisions on telecom licensing during nda's period should also be inquired into.the meeting takes place on a day opposition bjp, which has launched an offensive against congress on the issue of corruption, is likely to take a call on yeddyurappa.the congress is also flustered over the developments in andhra pradesh where a tv channel owned by party mp y s jaganmohan reddy launched an attack on sonia and the prime minister on saturday.the central leadership today sought a report from the state unit on the issue.""the party has sought a report from the state unit on the issue (telecast of a programme on sakshi television channel),"" aicc media department chairman janardhan dwivedi said.party spokesman shakeel ahmed said a view on the issue would be taken once the report is received from the state unit.sakshi, the 24-hour telugu news channel owned by the kadapa mp, had launched a frontal attack on gandhi as well as the organisation in a one-hour programme yesterday.congress leaders from the state have reacted sharply to the issue. a senior party leader from the state k keshava rao said that there was a ""design"" behind the telecast and jaganmohan has ""gone too far"" and ""something needs to be done"".rao said that jaganmohan wants the party to take action against him so that he becomes a hero and then form a regional party of his own ""but a party like congress will not act in haste"".pm should admit if has made a mistake on spectrum issue: cpi(m)asking prime minister manmohan singh to accept if he had made a ""mistake"" on the 2g spectrum issue, cpi(m) on sunday said the telecom department has admitted that it had kept the prime minister's office informed on all decisions and there was ""no difference of opinion"" between them.senior cpi(m) leader sitaram yechury quoted an affidavit filed by the department of telecommunications in the supreme court as saying that ""not only was there no difference of opinion with the hon'ble prime minister, his office was also fully kept informed of all decisions"".copies of portions of the affidavit were circulated at the cpi(m) press conference, along with several letters exchanged between the prime minister and former telecom minister a raja on 2g spectrum allocation between 2007 and 2008.yechury said it was the government's ""own admission, and not an opposition charge and government itself and the former minister (a raja) have dragged the pm's name.""""there is always a charge against us that we are questioning the integrity (of the prime minister). what we are questioning is your infallibility and not your integrity. if you have made a mistake, accept it,"" yechury said.he reiterated the party's demand that the prime minister should make a statement in parliament and accept a joint parliamentary committee probe into the scam.""we want the jpc to be announced tomorrow. let the prime minister speak and explain, we are ready to hear him. we are talking of a scam which is not a small issue. it could have otherwise created a better india,"" yechury said.the estimated loss of rs 1.76 lakh crore could have ""eliminated hunger"" through a universal public distribution system and funded universal education throughout the country,"" he said.cpi(m) general secretary prakash karat, who briefed the press conference on the deliberations of the three-day central committee meeting, said, ""it is not just a question of one minister or ministry. it is very clear that what happened (on the spectrum issue) was known to the prime minister, the finance ministry, the law ministry and the entire government"".he said that was why there was a need to have a jpc probe and there were ""much wider ramifications. ... why this massive loss was allowed to happen? why was nothing done for full two years"".karat demanded action against all those guilty, including the ""corporates who colluded to deprive the nation"".responding to union minister kapil sibal's statement that the 2g licences should not be cancelled, he said the upa was ""willing to condone corporate crime. they are more concerned about scaring investors but not about the huge loss of funds"".cbi's 2g probe on basis of loss calculated by cvc, not cagdespite the cag quantifying the presumptive revenue loss to the exchequer at rs 1.76 lakh crore due to non-auctioning of spectrum, the cbi will continue to conduct its probe on the basis of the report submitted by the cvc which had pegged the loss at around rs 22,000 crore.cbi officials associated with the probe said on the condition of anonymity that the figures put out by the cag in its report tabled in parliament were too high and could not be proved in the court of law.a prosecution in the court of law can never be done on the basis of presumption or notional value, the official said, adding there was a provision available with the cbi which entitles it to carry out its own estimate so that the agency could answer all the queries in the court.""we are weighing all the options before proceeding towards the finality of the case. the agency has already informed the supreme court that the investigations in this matter would be complete by february next year,"" a senior cbi official said and added that the

2010-11-23,no closure as yet on mumbai,"parliament has been brought to a halt because of the 2g spectrum scam. the opposition thinks it is justified in demanding a joint parliamentary committee ( jpc), considering the magnitude of the corruption and the seemingly extraordinary measures- including having a friendly cvc appointed- that have been taken, by those who do not want the culprits to be exposed. you may say that the indian parliament is like that only, but consider, on the other hand, the us congress. in january 2009, it held two- day hearings on the mumbai terrorist attack and its implications. in march this year another subcommittee held hearings on the lashkar- e- tayyeba. in contrast, none of our parliament's committees have seen it fit to conduct hearings on a matter which you will agree is every bit as important, if not more, than the 2g spectrum scam.these thoughts come to mind because we are just days away from the 2nd anniversary of the terror attack that took so many lives and destroyed so many families, not just in india, but across the world. in these two years, there has been a lull of sorts in terror strikes in india.barring the pune bakery attack, there has been no major strike attributed to the islamist terrorists, homegrown, or otherwise.revelationsyet, it would be hazardous to argue that counter- measures taken in the wake of the mumbai attack, which coincided with the exposure of the so- called indian mujahideen group that had carried out a series of bombings in cities across the country, have acted as a deterrent against fresh attacks. neither would it be prudent to claim that the arrest of david coleman headley and pakistan's domestic preoccupations with the tehreek- e- taliban pakistan have led to this lull.what is remarkable is that though it has been two years since 26/ 11, we are still learning new things about the manner in which the attack was planned and launched. in october 2009, we learnt about the role of daood gilani aka david coleman headley in providing reconnaissance for the attackers. unfortunately, the extent of headley's role in the conspiracy became apparent only after he had plea bargained with the us authorities to avoid a death sentence.this year, courtesy propublica and washington post , we have come to learn of the role played by sajid mir, headley's handler, in the attack. mir was the voice which was providing to the rampaging gunmen minute- by- minute directions, including those that led to the execution of several hostages. mir's name figured in the dossier that india gave to pakistan in february 2010. he was described as a top lashkar- e- tayyeba commander. but the propublica report implies that mir is a serving officer of the pakistan army.indeed, it cites the french anti- terrorism judge jean- louis bruguire to say that mir "" was a high- ranking officer in the pakistani army and apparently also was in the isi."" the indian dossier of february also lists a major iqbal who also acted as headley's handler. he was the person who provided money to headley for his expenses in india. bob woodward noted in his obama's wars , that initially the cia claimed that the pakistan army was not involved in the mumbai attack, but then, in a footnote he disclosed that "" the cia later received reliable intelligence that the isi was directly involved in the training for mumbai."" in fact, the cia had within a month of the attacks got direct confirmation from lt gen ahmed shuja pasha, the isi chief, that at least two retired pakistani army officers with isi links were involved in the attacks, though the general had denied tht this was "" an authorised isi operation."" so our current dilemma, as well as that of the united states is: how do we deal with the pakistan army which is complicit in this monstrous event? there are no easy answers. for the us, maintaining good relations with pakistan is the key to its afghan commitment.quandariesand that engagement is crucially dependent on the attitude and role of the pakistan army. so, even though by law, the us administration must bring to book the mumbai killers who were responsible for the deaths of, among others, six american nationals, they remain helpless on the issue.for india, too, the predicament is acute.new delhi would like to continue the process of reconciliation and resolution of all disputes that had gained great momentum in the presidency of pervez musharraf. but since then, things have gone steadily downhill, despite the efforts of the civilian leadership in pakistan and prime minister manmohan singh. the single factor militating against this has been the actions of the pakistan army. it may be recalled that it was army chief ashfaq parvez kayani, who was the isi boss when the conspiracy was launched, who prevented the civilian government from sending gen shuja pasha to india.it was the same kayani who torpedoed the july 2010 foreign ministers meeting by getting shah mehmood qureshi to take a hostile line against his visiting counterpart s. m. krishna at the joint press conference. we should not forget, either, that it was the pakistan army under musharraf which had undermined the far- reaching lahore agreement of 1999 by organising the kargil incursion.with the us virtually hors de combat because of the afghan quagmire, india has little additional diplomatic leverage against pakistan on the mumbai attack issue; new delhi lacks the military leverage to pressure islamabad in any case.the case against zakiur rehman lakhvi, and a few others, moves on desultorily in the pakistani courts, and the pakistan army conspirators, retired or otherwise, are not even on the radar of the authorities.the international scene is not too good either. we may have got david cameron's ringing endorsement and obama's nuanced one, but pakistan has powerful and amoral china in its corner. the discussions of the counter- terrorism committee of the united nations this september, do not give any hope that the international community is determined to rid the world of the scourge of terrorism.the un counter- terrorism edifice rests on three resolutions. the first, 1373, adopted in response to nine eleven requires all states to criminalise terrorist acts and penalise financing and other support for terrorism.aloneresolution 1267 of october 1999 imposes an air embargo and an assets freeze on the taliban. resolution 1540 of april 2004 is aimed at preventing weapons of mass destruction from falling into the hands of non- state actors. as the september 2010 meeting noted, states were ready to unequivocally condemn terrorism, but there is still no un definition of terrorism, a lacuna that leaves a huge loophole for member states like pakistan to slip through.so, the key take away from the two years of counter- terrorism is that international cooperation remains, at best, limited. notwithstanding american commitments and agreements, the us has its own self- imposed limits which it cannot exceed. as for the un, it remains a talking shop. the fight against terrorism for us thus remains a lonely road. we can, and must, take what help we can when it is offered. but we must be clear that in terms of planning, organising and execution of counter- terrorist strategy, we are on our own.unfortunately for the country, we have a set of parliamentarians who will do anything other than focus on this continuing and important threat to the country. and so, we must suffer the consequences.",0.1359110803412274,closure yet

which coincided with the exposure of the so- called indian mujahideen group that had carried out a series of bombings in cities across the country, have acted as a deterrent against fresh attacks. neither would it be prudent to claim that the arrest of david coleman headley and pakistan's domestic preoccupations with the tehreek- e- taliban pakistan have led to this lull.what is remarkable is that though it has been two years since 26/ 11, we are still learning new things about the manner in which the attack was planned and launched. in october 2009, we learnt about the role of daood gilani aka david coleman headley in providing reconnaissance for the attackers. unfortunately, the extent of headley's role in the conspiracy became apparent only after he had plea bargained with the us authorities to avoid a death sentence.this year, courtesy propublica and washington post , we have come to learn of the role played by sajid mir, headley's handler, in the attack. mir was the voice which was providing to the rampaging gunmen minute- by- minute directions, including those that led to the execution of several hostages. mir's name figured in the dossier that india gave to pakistan in february 2010. he was described as a top lashkar- e- tayyeba commander. but the propublica report implies that mir is a serving officer of the pakistan army.indeed, it cites the french anti- terrorism judge jean- louis bruguire to say that mir "" was a high- ranking officer in the pakistani army and apparently also was in the isi."" the indian dossier of february also lists a major iqbal who also acted as headley's handler. he was the person who provided money to headley for his expenses in india. bob woodward noted in his obama's wars , that initially the cia claimed that the pakistan army was not involved in the mumbai attack, but then, in a footnote he disclosed that "" the cia later received reliable intelligence that the isi was directly involved in the training for mumbai."" in fact, the cia had within a month of the attacks got direct confirmation from lt gen ahmed shuja pasha, the isi chief, that at least two retired pakistani army officers with isi links were involved in the attacks, though the general had denied tht this was "" an authorised isi operation."" so our current dilemma, as well as that of the united states is: how do we deal with the pakistan army which is complicit in this monstrous event? there are no easy answers. for the us, maintaining good relations with pakistan is the key to its afghan commitment.quandariesand that engagement is crucially dependent on the attitude and role of the pakistan army. so, even though by law, the us administration must bring to book the mumbai killers who were responsible for the deaths of, among others, six american nationals, they remain helpless on the issue.for india, too, the predicament is acute.new delhi would like to continue the process of reconciliation and resolution of all disputes that had gained great momentum in the presidency of pervez musharraf. but since then, things have gone steadily downhill, despite the efforts of the civilian leadership in pakistan and prime minister manmohan singh. the single factor militating against this has been the actions of the pakistan army. it may be recalled that it was army chief ashfaq parvez kayani, who was the isi boss when the conspiracy was launched, who prevented the civilian government from sending gen shuja pasha to india.it was the same kayani who torpedoed the july 2010 foreign ministers meeting by getting shah mehmood qureshi to take a hostile line against his visiting counterpart s. m. krishna at the joint press conference. we should not forget, either, that it was the pakistan army under musharraf which had undermined the far- reaching lahore agreement of 1999 by organising the kargil incursion.with the us virtually hors de combat because of the afghan quagmire, india has little additional diplomatic leverage against pakistan on the mumbai attack issue; new delhi lacks the military leverage to pressure islamabad in any case.the case against zakiur rehman lakhvi, and a few others, moves on desultorily in the pakistani courts, and the pakistan army conspirators, retired or otherwise, are not even on the radar of the authorities.the international scene is not too good either. we may have got david cameron's ringing endorsement and obama's nuanced one, but pakistan has powerful and amoral china in its corner. the discussions of the counter- terrorism committee of the united nations this september, do not give any hope that the international community is determined to rid the world of the scourge of terrorism.the un counter- terrorism edifice rests on three resolutions. the first, 1373, adopted in response to nine eleven requires all states to criminalise terrorist acts and penalise financing and other support for terrorism.aloneresolution 1267 of october 1999 imposes an air embargo and an assets freeze on the taliban. resolution 1540 of april 2004 is aimed at preventing weapons of mass destruction from falling into the hands of non- state actors. as the september 2010 meeting noted, states were ready to unequivocally condemn terrorism, but there is still no un definition of terrorism, a lacuna that leaves a huge loophole for member states like pakistan to slip through.so, the key take away from the two years of counter- terrorism is that international cooperation remains, at best, limited. notwithstanding american commitments and agreements, the us has its own self- imposed limits which it cannot exceed. as for the un, it remains a talking shop. the fight against terrorism for us thus remains a lonely road. we can, and must, take what help we can when it is offered. but we must be clear that in terms of planning, organising and execution of counter- terrorist strategy, we are on our own.unfortunately for the country, we have a set of parliamentarians who will do anything other than focus on this continuing and important threat to the country. and so, we must suffer the consequences.",0.1359110803412274,closure yet

""even these 100 reveal too much on how the country is being run, how politicians are subservient, how decisions in court are fixed, how mps lobby for business houses and how corporates manage everything in this country,"" he said. pointing to radia's contact list, bhushan said the tapes show that she can call anyone in the bureaucracy.referring to the petition by industrialist ratan tata seeking to prevent publication of the transcripts to protect his right to privacy, bhushan said the tapes revealed commission of several illegal and immoral acts with regard to governance which people in general had the right to know.bhushan got support from justice ganguly who cited a judgment by a seven-judge bench on open governance. the cpil counsel said it was not just the 2g scam but the tapes also showed commission of several illegal acts which should be brought in the public domain. ""the court has said in several other judgments also that people are the ultimate masters of this country and they have a right to know,"" he said.justice singhvi, noting that some journalists present in the courtroom were smiling, said the concept of open governance had brought smiles on faces of some young women who probably represented the media.in the course of the hearing, justice ganguly sought to know what would happen in a case where both private and public interest merged. ""in such cases the right of the people to know should override,"" bhushan said. even though the judge did not say anything, he seemed to agree with the advocate.after bhushan read from the transcripts of what have come to be known as the radia tapes, the court sought to know about radia's profession. bhushan said that she was a consultant but the expanse of her brief included lobbying with law makers, journalists and top bureaucrats.""that is not an ostensible profession,"" justice ganguly said. ""according to her she is a consultant, according to you she is a wheeler dealer,"" justice singhvi said.justice ganguly, thereafter, said that the word 'profession' meant something which was honourable and suggested the use of some other expression to describe radia's work. on the comments made by the bench during the hearing, the court clarified that when it said something it only tried to respond to social ethos.bhushan said the tapes showed how the constitution was being subverted in the interest of a few corporate houses.even though the court was hearing cpil's petition seeking a court-monitored probe in the 2g spectrum scam, bhushan read out some of the transcripts to show the importance of the revelations and requested the court to ensure that the tapes did not disappear or get destroyed.the advocate said the court should keep a copy of the tapes in safe custody like it did in the jain hawala case when it kept the jain diary in its custody. ""there is an attempt to ensure that the tapes do not see the light of the day,"" bhushan said.taking note of this demand, the court sought the response of the incometax department by wednesday on why a copy of the tapes should not be kept in safe custody by the court.bhushan said people were living in a dream world and did not know what corporates were doing. the court should pass an interim order on preservation of tapes before they disappear.bhushan argued that there was nothing which should prevent the tapes from being revealed to the public. personal information could be concealed under the right to privacy only if it did not involve any public activity or interest.tata's petitionratan tata has submitted in his petition before the supreme court that damage to his reputation because of the leaked telephone conversations would also affect investors of the tata group of companies. he also asked the court to protect his right to privacy. for this, he requested that the court:""direct the ministry of home, finance, director general income tax and the cbi to take steps to immediately retrieve and recover as far as possible all recordings that have been removed from their custody""""direct the government to conduct through the cbi or any other authority a thorough inquiry into the manner in which these secret records were, contrary to the rules, made available and/or became available to those not authorised to so receive the recordings and file a report before this court""""direct the government and its agents to ensure that no further publication of these recordings, either as audio files through the internet or any print as transcripts appears in any media - print or electronic - and for that purpose take steps as may be necessary, including but not limiting to steps under the cable television networks regulation act, 1995, the information technology act, 2000, the code of criminal procedure, 1973, read with the indian penal code, 1860, and any other law as may be necessary""",0.03792175961293608,extent corporate lobbying shocks supreme court,"revelations influence wielded corporate power players , evident telephonic conversations involving corporate lobbyist nira radia , shocked supreme court.

2010-12-17,congress to hold two-day plenary from sunday,"congress is holding a two-day plenary in new delhi from sunday at a time when the party and the government are facing tough times in the wake of a rash of scams and controversies thrown by them.it is also being held at a time when a leaked us diplomatic cable has kicked up a political storm by quoting rahul gandhi as saying that hindu radical groups pose a bigger threat to india than the lashkar-e-taiba.the plenary, with the theme of ""dedication and service of 125 years"" is being held against the backdrop of the party's debacle in the assembly polls in bihar.the talk of corruption spawned by the leaked conversations in the radia tapes has also dented the image of the upa government headed by the congress.facing one of the toughest times in its 125 year history, the congress will give shape to its strategy to tackle these controversies besides deliberating on crucial issues facing the country.party president sonia gandhi is expected to spell out the party's strategy for next year's assembly elections in west bengal, tamil nadu, kerala, assam and puducherry.the congress is dependent on allies like the trinamool congress in west bengal and dmk in tamil nadu.the dmk has been grappling with the 2g spectrum controversy with cbi raids on dmk leaders including former telecom minister a raja.while trinamool congress appears to be giving a cold shoulder to congress for alliance in the west bengal polls, ncp chief sharad pawar, whose party is another upa ally, has said that some decisions of the government have left investors and india inc disturbed.from the speech of late rajiv gandhi against middlemen in the congress centenary conclave in mumbai in 1985 to the 125th year conference in burari on the city's outskirts at a time of expose over corporate lobbyists, it has been a long journey for the party.25 years ago, rajiv gandhi had given the call during the centenary celebrations in mumbai in a hard-hitting address on the state of affairs in the party whose workers, he had said, were ""handicapped as on their backs rode the brokers of power and influence"".after leading the party to the biggest victory in the lok sabha polls after the assassination of indira gandhi, rajiv gandhi who was then called 'mr clean', had warned that industrial empires, built on shaky foundations of excessive protection and corruption among others, might not last long.now, an embattled congress is hopping from one controversy after another and as sonia gandhi faces the challenge of resurrecting the party and the coalition government from a web of charges.notwithstanding the thumping victory in last year's lok sabha elections, things appear to be not going the congress and the upa way in the last few months.the 2g spectrum allocation scam is the latest to hit the upa-ii with the opposition dubbing it as the biggest scandal in independent india with the cag computing a presumptive loss of rs1.76 lakh crore to the exchequer.the country was also rocked by the alleged scams surrounding the commonwealth games, whose organising committee was headed by congress mp suresh kalmadi, and the adarsh housing society in mumbai that cost the party chief minister ashok chavan his job.the plenary is the third such meet since sonia gandhi took over the stewardship of the party in 1998.the scams have given a boost to the bjp-led national democratic alliance and other opposition parties which had paralysed parliament in the just-concluded winter session in what was the longest shutdown of the lok sabha and the rajya sabha.recently, sonia gandhi herself had expressed concern over the growing cases of ""graft and greed"".the opposition is unlikely to budge from its stand on the constitution of a joint parliamentary committee to go into the 2g spectrum scam, notwithstanding prime minister manmohan singh's lament that parliament was not being allowed to function.the confrontation between the two sides is expected to grow in the coming days and months with the opposition determined to carry its campaign on the jpc demand to the budget session.though the plenary is supposed to lay down the party's roadmap for the immediate future, but coming in the backdrop of scandals, the focus of the party's 83rd plenary will essentially be on how the congress aggressively counters the opposition

and kanimozhi and her mother are on the other. their links with raja are already under the scanner.skeletons continue to tumble out of the 2g spectrum cupboard and the radia tapes. the dmk supremo was recently forced to break his silence when his fierce critic and saffron ideologue cho ramaswamy made a caustic remark in thuglak magazine about karunanidhi's grandnephew dayanidhi maran ""offering rs 600 crore"" to dayalu (karunanidhi's second wife) to become a minister. the allegation was contained in one of the taped radia conversations.wondering at the silence of the dmk, cho had said that this revealed the manner in which ministers got their cabinet berths.karunanidhi immediately jumped to dayanidhi's defence and flatly denied the pay-off.but he was reportedly sore at being kept in the dark about the developments happening around him.interestingly, it was recently reported that karunanidhi, cm of tamil nadu, was dismissed as ""senile"" and one who wouldn't last long in a conversation between corporate lobbyist nira radia, raja and kanimozhi.and if that wasn't enough, uncharitable references were apparently also made to alagiri in a phone conversation between a state minister belonging to the kanimozhi faction and radia.all this then has just added fuel to the fire.while stalin and alagiri are clearly baying for the blood of raja and kanimozhi, seeking to cut the latter down to size, the marans have kept their cards close to their chest. they also have a powerful interlocutor to lobby their case with their grand uncle - the patriarch's daughter selvi, who is married into the maran family.indicative of the bonhomie between the marans and the dayalu lineage was the recent marriage of alagiri's son in madurai, in which kanimozhi kept a low profile.and then there was the reported bash the marans gave on the day of raja's resignation, in which both alagiri and stalin were present.weeks later, alagiri flew down from madurai to wish dayanidhi on his birthday, which was also telecast on the family-owned sun tv. the isolation of kanimozhi and her camp is becoming clear and the others have not been able to hide their glee at this.but this is obviously not what karunanidhi had laboured on for so long. yet, the fact remains that he is neither in control of his party nor the state government.while he remains worried about the cataclysmic impact of the spectrum scam on the dmk's poll prospects, the others in his family are more concerned about containing their rivals, in this case their own kin.",0.08194444444444443,2g : karuna faces internal rebellion,"daggers drawn dmk patriarch m. karunanidhi ' family.the dmk family happier times patriarch karunanidhis birthdaywhat till realm speculation , confirmed -

""i would like all congress chief ministers and ministers both at the centre and in the states to set an example by reviewing and relinquishing powers.""noting significantly that there was no clapping from the delegates on this suggestion, the congress president reminded party leaders of the need to be clean in public life.""congressmen and women, holding office, must not allow any doubt about their probity and integrity. it ill becomes representatives of a party claiming to speak for the poor to indulge in greed, extravagance and luxury.""simplicity, restraint and austerity must be our chosen way. we cannot make this a law. but in a country where poverty is still widespread, let us at least have moral sensibility to avoid vulgar displays of wealth and waste,"" she said.the congress unseated ashok chavan from maharashtra chief ministership in the wake of adarsh housing society scam, removed suresh kalmadi from the post of secretary of the parliamentary party after charges of irregularities in cwg.a raja, a representative of dmk, was also forced to resign as union telecom minister in the wake of 2g scam.in this context, gandhi hit out at bjp questioning whether it had removed anybody facing corruption charges.""even when no charge has been established, we have asked ministers and chief ministers to step down, pending inquiry. how many other parties can make such a claim? can the bjp do so in regard to karnataka where corruption is rampant or other states?""she attacked the opposition parties for not allowing the winter session to function, asking ""can anything justify bringing parliament to a halt? can the opposition justify undermining the norms on which a parliamentary democracy functions?""surely, parliament cannot be held hostage to political expediency. parliament itself is the forum to discuss and resolve contentious issues.""as part of the action plan to take corruption head-on, gandhi suggested that the government should consider how best to take forward the proposal of state funding of elections.she also said that the government must ensure through legislation and clear procedures full transparency in public procurement and contracts.""it is the duty of the administration to ensure that there is no subversion of due process. and should it come to pass, whistle-blowers must be protected,"" she said.there is also need for an open competitive system of exploiting natural resources, which has now assumed much greater urgency, the congress chief said.hailing prime minister manmohan singh, gandhi said he is ""the embodiment of sobriety, dignity and integrity"" and denounced bjp's personal attack on him as ""downright despicable"".""on your behalf, i want to compliment him for his wise leadership, for remaining calm amidst the storm and for his unwavering devotion to the progress and prosperity of the nation. the party stands solidly with him,"" she said.praising singh's leadership, she said the economy has moved to much higher growth path. ""his stewardship through the global (economic) crisis is acknowledged universally. it is this high economic growth that has enabled us to fund our social welfare programmes and schemes. it has also enabled our government to transfer unprecedented financial resources to the states.""gandhi said as the government sustains the momentum of high economic growth, it also faces the challenges of essential commodities whose prices must be kept at affordable levels and inflation kept in check.she said subsidies meant for the poor must reach them and them alone. ""subsidies enjoyed by the relatively well-off must be redirected to those in need. it is essential that the quality of public education and healthcare is vastly improved,"" she said.in a message to the party cadres and leaders, the congress chief said party must always come before the individual and its cohesion should not be jeopardised.""let me say that our future will be shaped not by a magic wand or any single individual. our future will depend on our party's capacity to work together as a team and to ensure that our organisation does not pull in different directions.""there are always personal disappointments in politics as in other walks of life. i can understand individual ambitions but when they are not fulfilled, the party's cohesion should not be jeopardised,"" she said.earlier in her speech, gandhi stressed the need for ""periodic introspection of critical issues"" in the organisation to keep pace with the times.she said that in the coming months, the party will hold a conclave similar to the brainstorming session in panchmarhi and simla.talking about poll debacle in bihar, she said it has only demonstrated that there was no alternative to earnestly beginning the process of revising the party organisation from the grassroots.""there are no short-cuts. the road ahead will be long and arduous but we will persevere and we will succeed. there is no time for despondency. this is a time for constructive action, including in those states where we are in coalition.""with inputs from pti",0.03646658598271501,"communalism majority , minority dangerous : sonia gandhi","congress president sonia gandhi addressing 83rd plenary session inc new delhi. ptiin two-pronged attack fundamentalism corruption , congress president sonia gandhi sunday said majority minority communalism dangerous must defeated favoured fast-tracking corruption cases , including politicians.addressing congress plenary , dwelt length two subjects backdrop number corruption charges hitting party upa government headed controversy surrounding rahul gandhi ' comments hindu radicalism "" bigger threat "" groups like lashkar-e-taiba.video : cong vows fight terror , graftcongress president ' term extended five years doors dialogue extremists must kept open : sonia sonia chides central ministers ignoring partymen india ' muslims largely unattracted extremism : us cableuma-modi ' rahul salvo provides cong escape route "" congress party makes distinction organisations majority minority communities indulge communalism related acts terrorism. dangerous , must defeated , "" gandhi said 30-minute presidential address two-day plenary session began sunday.maintaining congress always fought forms communalism , regardless source , gandhi said , "" communalism abuse religion narrow political purposes. abuse religion spread hatred bigotry. abuse religion polarise society divide us.

script went awry in a rare case of a former union minister having to undergo the ignominy of arrest consumed by the 2g spectrum scam.former telecom minister a. raja.a prominent dalit face of dmk, 47-year-old raja had come a long way from being a lawyer and a block-level leader in rural tamil nadu to union minister of state and finally a cabinet minister before he was forced to quit in november last year.the end of his stint as union telecom minister mired in a huge controversy came in a brutal rush after days of stalemate and now his arrest comes at a critical time for the dmk ahead of the assembly elections in tamil nadu.the dalit factor helped raja get early breaks in his political career, like becoming a union minister at the age of 35--in the nda government in 1999. and he never looked back holding several portfolios both in the nda and upa regimes at the centre.he became telecom minister in may 2007. and again in 2009, despite 2g scam allegations and the high-profile

ministry surprised many in the political corridors in delhi, but karunanidhi and his dmk stood by him all along despite widespread allegations against him over his involvement in alleged irregularities in the 2g spectrum allocation.raja was born on may 10, 1963 in perambalur in tamil nadu and often likes to reminisce that he had to go to trichy for an education as there were no facilities nearer home. in trichy, raja got a bsc and then his law degrees. he was a student leader of the dravidar kazhagam, the parent body of the dmk.as an interesting aside, raja writes poetry in

re-elected in 2009.his catchphrase in that election campaign was ""oru kilo arisi oru rupa, oru hello 50 paisa"" (one kg rice one rupee, a hello on the phone 50 paisa).when he resigned on november 14, raja again said, ""i brought revolution in the telecom sector."" but his bid to take credit has been neutralised by the controversial 2g spectrum allocation.raja hit headlines for the wrong reasons ever since he allocated license for the 2g bandwidth in 2007 soon after he took over the coveted portfolio.raja has been facing criticism after he decided in 2007 to bring in new players and give licenses and spectrum as per the existing policy of ""first-cum-first-serve"" basis and rejected demands for auctioning.after the licenses were given on january 2008 at 2001 prices of rs. 1,658 crore, two of the telecom operators who got spectrum sold part of the equity at much higher premium.this led to controversy as it was felt that the spectrum allocation had led to a huge loss to public exchequer.various agencies including cbi, cvc and cag started independent investigations into the alleged scam.the cag has put the loss at rs. 1.40 lakh crore on the basis of new licences of 2008 and rs. 36,000 crore on giving licenses to existing operators for giving additional spectrum beyond contractual limit of 6.2 mhz.raja had been pleading innocence ever since he was targeted by the

2011-05-14,tamil nadu polls: rout threatens unity of karunanidhi's family,"divided as it is, the karunanidhi clan members have the daggers drawn at one another. the dmk's crushing electoral defeat at the hands of j. jayalalithaa has cast a shadow on the unity in the patriarch's extended family. with the 2g spectrum scam threatening to engulf the family, the octogenarian leader's daughter and rajya sabha mp, kanimozhi, has been already isolated. with the loss of power, the schism within is expected to spill over in the near future. but as of now there is an eerie silence in the dmk as the party is yet to come to terms with the rout in the assembly polls. to rub salt into its wounds, the fledgling dmdk of actor vijaykant has emerged as the second largest party in the state and the dmk can't even be the principal opposition in the assembly. both the dravidian parties have a history of withdrawing into their shell in the event of a defeat at the hustings; only to re-emerge at the time of the next election. but the dynamics has changed because the dmk shares power at the centre, giving it a lifeline of support. but this in itself is creating heartburn within the karunanidhi clan.when the cbi chargesheeted kanimozhi, the patriarch quelled the dissension in the family and ensured that the party rallied around his favourite daughter. if it retained power in the state, the party had even hoped to take on the congress. but the party has now been forced to be at the senior ally's mercy.brothers alagiri and stalin - while remaining competitors to inherit the mantle of their father - remain on the same page when it comes to the 2g scam. the wily dayanidhi maran has also teamed up with them. the patriarch had managed to contain alagiri's provocations urging the partymen to demand action when he sought a. raja's expulsion in the wake of the 2g scam surfacing and the prodigal son's ravings when kanimozhi was named a co-conspirator in the case. but following the recent rout at the hustings, the blame game can commence any time and there could be many voices demanding kanimozhi's scalp. it remains to be seen what the kalaignar does to save his party and family from the raging fire within. the battle lines have been drawn and it needs just a spark to ignite the war. the party leaders feel that karunanidhi will continue to protect his favourite daughter, adding to the simmering discontent in the family.karunanidhi's bitter critic and columnist gnani maintains that despite the factional feud within, it might be business as usual in the family.

2011-05-17,"2g scam: jpc examines telecom policy of nda govt, to summon fomer attorney general soli sorabjee","the joint parliamentary committee (jpc) on 2g spectrum scam on wednesday began examining the telecom policy pursued during the national democratic alliance (nda) rule as it sought to know the quantum of losses incurred during that period and decided to summon the then attorney general soli sorabjee in this connection.at its second meeting since being set up in february, the jpc headed by congress leader p c chacko went into matters related to the telecom policy, allocation of spectrum and its pricing between 1998 and 2008.indian telecom secretary r chandrashekhar, who appeared before the 30-member committee, gave a detailed briefing on the issue tracing the history of the present telecom policy.several members raised pointed questions on the changes in telecom policy in the nda rule that allowed operators to migrate from fixed license fee regime to the revenue sharing model.addressing a press conference after the meeting, chacko said the comptroller and auditor general report of 2000 clearly stated that the change in policy had caused a ""huge loss"" to the exchequer.the cag had then expressed its inability to quantify the losses and details of the license fees and concession offered to operators in the wake of migration policy were not available, he said.""since the figures are available now, the committee has directed the telecom secretary to quantify the losses,"" chacko said.noting that the cabinet decision of july 6, 1999 to change the policy was based on the advise of the then attorney general soli sorabjee, the committee has decided to call him as a witness.in reply to a question, chacko said technically there was no bar on calling committee members as witnesses. he was referring to bharatiya janata party (bjp) leaders yashwant sinha and jaswant singh, who are members of the jpc and were part of the nda cabinet in 1999 when the decision was taken.""so far we have not felt the need to call cabinet ministers,"" he said.sorabjee said he has so far not received any notice or communication from the jpc and if the committee wants any information or explanation from him, he will ""certainly cooperate"".asked if the committee members from opposition parties took objection to the jpc probe into the policy shift during the nda regime, chacko said, ""there was no division on political lines. everybody shared the concern on the losses.""different opinions were expressed on how the government had arrived at the decision.sources said congress member manish tewari and cpi(m) member gurudas dasgupta were vocal when the presentations on the telecom policy from 1998-2001 were made by officials of the department of telecom.asked whether the jpc would take into consideration the 'report' of the public accounts committee, chacko said, ""we do not know yet whether there is any official report of the pac.""on whether the jpc would call for evidence gathered by the pac, he said, ""we have collected much more information than any other committee has collected. we are self sufficient. if there is need we can ask for more documents to be provided to us immediately.""chacko sidestepped questions on whether he would ask former telecom minister a raja to appear before the jpc and said he would go by what the members recommend.asked whether some members have already recommended raja as a witness, he said he was yet to go through the long list.""we will inform members well in advance before calling any witness as we don't want to surprise them,"" he said.at the outset, chacko informed the committee of speaker meira kumar's ruling with regard to the continuance of bjp members yashwant sinha and jaswant singh in the jpc.he said the speaker had ruled that since there was no objection to the nomination of singh and sinha when the resolution to constitute the jpc was passed by parliament, and their background was in public knowledge the question of objection does not arise. some members had questioned the presence of the two bjp leaders on the jpc contending that both were the then union cabinet ministers and part of decision-making process in telecom sector between 1998-2008.tewari had offered to recuse from the committee stating that he had represented telecom companies in courts between 2001 and 2004.quoting rules, chacko said since no member objected to tewari representing telecom companies, the matter stood ""closed"".on the issue of jpc and pac holding similar probes, the speaker has already ruled that the two panels should work in close cooperation and harmony with each other.- with pti inputs",0.08842364532019706,"2g scam : jpc examines telecom policy nda govt ,

dismissed her bail plea in the 2g spectrum scam, saying there was a possibility of witnesses being influenced considering the ""magnitude"" of the crime.the 43-year-old daughter of karunanidhi's second wife rajathi, was shocked on hearing the order pronounced by special cbi judge o p saini but maintained her calm in the court.however, tears welled up in her eyes when she was taken to the court lock-up by police personnel.clad in an orange salwar suit, she was later driven in a delhi police van to tihar prison where she will be lodged in jail no 6. former telecom minister a raja is already lodged in tihar.the judge also rejected the bail plea of sharad kumar, md and ceo of kalaignar tv private ltd, who along with kanimozhi, faces the charge of conspiracy and bribery in accepting rs.200 crore from d b realty for the channel in the spectrum scam.""considering the magnitude of the crime, nature and enormity of the allegations, character of evidence on record and the apprehension that the witnesses may be influenced in case the accused are released on bail, i have no hesitation in holding that both applicants/accused have failed to make out a prima facie case for bail.""bail applications are without merit and the same are dismissed,"" the court said in its 144-page order brushing aside her lawyer ram jethamalani's arguments that urged for chivalry for her being a woman.kanimozhi, who was accompanied by her husband aravindan, family members and dmk parliamentary party chief leader t r baalu, first inquired about the order from a raja as she could not hear it properly.as raja broke the news to her, stunned kanimozhi tried very hard to control emotions and was being hugged by her husband before some women constables took over and led her inside the lock-up.the court said most of the witnesses against the dmk mp are the employees of kalaignar tv and hence, possibility of they being influenced cannot be ruled out.""considering the magnitude of the crime and the fact that many of the witnesses are employees of kalaignar tv, there is every apprehension that the witnesses may be influenced, if the accused are released on bail,"" it said.the court, which did not go into the merits of the case and termed the observations as ""tentative"", said that there were ""incriminating"" evidence against her and sharad.""the role of both of the accused in the case is clear... magnitude of the crime is enormous. the allegations, on the face of it, are very grave.""the supporting evidence is also there on record. the submissions, as such, with utmost respect are without merit,"" the court said.the court, which had reserved its order on may 7, on the bail applications of kanimozhi and sharad kumar has referred to various judgments of the supreme court to negate the arguments of noted criminal lawyer ram jethmalani who appeared for the dmk leader.the court rejected the legal argument that an accused be released on bail if she was not arrested during investigations.""it is clear that on the appearance of an accused in court in response to summons issued by the court, his bail application is required to be disposed of on merits of the case and bail cannot be allowed as matter of right.""as such the accused has no right to be released on bail simply because she was not arrested during investigation and appeared in the court in response to the summons. he has to make out a case for bail on merits,"" it said while referring to various case laws on the issue.giving reasons for denial of bail, the court said some of the key witnesses against them were the employees of kalaignar tv, alleged recipient of rs 200 crore bribe from firms promoted by shahid usman balwa and they can be influenced upon.the court also cited the statements of prosecution witnesses g rajendran, an employee of kalaignar tv and aseervatham achary, a former aide of raja, to refer to the culpability of kanimozhi and sharad kumar in the 2g scam.the judge said that both the accused were in conspiracy with each other and a raja. they played key roles in receiving illegal gratification for their television channel in which both held 20 per cent shares each.the court also rejected the plea of jethmalani that kanimozhi be released on the sole ground that she is a woman.""sex is one of the grounds which may be considered at the time of grant of bail. however, considering the magnitude of the crime and the allegations against her, i am unable to show any consideration to her on this ground,"" the court said.however, the ""dignified"" conduct of kanimozhi during court proceedings earned special praise for her.""i wish, i could show her some consideration, considering her extremely dignified conduct in the court,"" the cbi judge said.cbi had chargesheeted kanimozhi on april 25 in the scam. it had indicted her of having taken bribe to the tune of rs 200 crore, which was routed to kalaignar tv, in which she has 20 percent stake.besides kanimozhi, former tamil nadu chief minister karunanidhi's wife dayalu ammal, holds 60 per cent share in the kalaignar tv.she, however, was not chargesheeted in the case as the cbi said she neither

2011-05-20,"2g scam: with kanimozhi's arrest, cbi guns for more beneficiaries","dmk mp kanimozhi has become the latest in a gradually growing line of influential persons to be jailed in the 2g spectrum scam case.the daughter of dmk supremo m. karunanidhi was sent to tihar jail by a special cbi court on charges of receiving kickbacks in the 2g scam. her case has sent into a tizzy other well-connected beneficiaries of the scam, unnerved by the fact that someone belonging to the dmk first family - and a member of a key upa ally - could be jailed.forty-three-year-old kanimozhi is the twelfth big name to be added to the list of vips in tihar jail after former telecom minister a. raja, former telecom secretary siddhartha behura, raja's personal secretary r. k. chandolia and seven corporate honchos.however, the series of high-profile arrests is expected to continue. kanimozhi was held after the cbi filed its second charge sheet.the premier investigating agency is now training its guns on corporate firms loop telecom, s tel and data com, alleged beneficiaries of spectrum allocation, to nail them in its third charge sheet. this is likely to be filed this month before a special cbi court.a joint team of the cbi and the enforcement directorate is all set to visit mauritius to unearth the ownership of delphi investments which bought reliance telecom's stake held in m/s swan telecom, a beneficiary of the 2g scam.the agency had on may 12 questioned essar group's ceo, prashant ruia, in connection essar's links with loop telecom which got a unified access service licence for 21 circles in 2008.according to cbi sources, loop telecom was ineligible for spectrum licence and essar had a joint venture with vodafone for mobile services, and at the same time had a stake in loop.the cbi suspects that loop telecom was a front for essar group, which held more than 10 per cent in loop telecom and violated the department of telecom's cross-holding norms.topshots of loop telecom, s tel and videocon telecommunications have also been questioned by the premier investigating agency.sources said that owners of firms that allegedly benefited from the 2g scam could be in the line of fire. this could be a logical progression of the case following the arrests of ceos and heavyweight politicians involved. if kanimozhi's arrest has made them nervous it is because she is not only a dmk mp but the daughter of the dmk chief.on friday, dismissing kanimozhi's bail plea, special judge o.p.saini noted that a number of the witnesses listed in the case are employees of kalaignar tv and could be influenced by the accused if they are released on bail.kanimozhi is a part owner of the channel, along with sharad kumar, its ceo who was also arrested with the dmk mp for

said.investigating agencies have meanwhile probed top telecom corporate. sandeep basu, ceo of loop telecom was earlier questioned by the cbi.the probe agencies are trying to unravel the ownership pattern of the telecom companies.for instance, shipping stop dot com now loop telecom, had got 21 united access services (uas) licences but its authorised capital was only `5.2 crore against a requirement of `128 crore.the computer software company had misrepresented facts and was not eligible for grant of an uas licence.similarly s tel had got six uas licences but submitted false certificates regarding paid up capital, among others.arun mandhana, cfo and rupinder sikka, another top official of the company have already been questioned by cbi.the third company, data com services (now known as videocon telecommunications), had submitted a false certificate about the paid-up capital and got uas licences for 21 circles.the company's authorised capital according to a cag report was just `1 lakh against requirement of `138 crore. videocon's raj kumar dhoot, a rajya sabha mp, has been questioned by the cbi.meanwhile, official sources stated that after the third charge sheet is

2011-05-21,"2g scam: with kanimozhi's arrest, cbi guns for more beneficiaries","dmk mp kanimozhi has become the latest in a gradually growing line of influential persons to be jailed in the 2g spectrum scam case.the daughter of dmk supremo m. karunanidhi was sent to tihar jail by a special cbi court on charges of receiving kickbacks in the 2g scam. her case has sent into a tizzy other well-connected beneficiaries of the scam, unnerved by the fact that someone belonging to the dmk first family - and a member of a key upa ally - could be jailed.forty-three-year-old kanimozhi is the twelfth big name to be added to the list of vips in tihar jail after former telecom minister a. raja, former telecom secretary siddhartha behura, raja's personal secretary r. k. chandolia and seven corporate honchos.however, the series of high-profile arrests is expected to continue. kanimozhi was held after the cbi filed its second charge sheet.the premier investigating agency is now training its guns on corporate firms loop telecom, s tel and data com, alleged beneficiaries of spectrum allocation, to nail them in its third charge sheet. this is likely to be filed this month before a special cbi court.a joint team of the cbi and the enforcement directorate is all set to visit mauritius to unearth the ownership of delphi investments which bought reliance telecom's stake held in m/s swan telecom, a beneficiary of the 2g scam.the agency had on may 12 questioned essar group's ceo, prashant ruia, in connection essar's links with loop telecom which got a unified access service licence for 21 circles in 2008.according to cbi sources, loop telecom was ineligible for spectrum licence and essar had a joint venture with vodafone for mobile services, and at the same time had a stake in loop.the cbi suspects that loop telecom was a front for essar group, which held more than 10 per cent in loop telecom and violated the department of telecom's cross-holding norms.topshots of loop telecom, s tel and videocon telecommunications have also been questioned by the premier investigating agency.sources said that owners of firms that allegedly benefited from the 2g scam could be in the line of fire. this could be a logical progression of the case following the arrests of ceos and heavyweight politicians involved. if kanimozhi's arrest has made them nervous it is because she is not only a dmk mp but the daughter of the dmk chief.on friday, dismissing kanimozhi's bail plea, special judge o.p.saini noted that a number of the witnesses listed in the case are employees of kalaignar tv and could be influenced by the accused if they are released on bail.kanimozhi is a part owner of the channel, along with sharad kumar, its ceo who was also arrested with the dmk mp for receiving `200 crore in bribes from d b realty for the channel in the spectrum scam.""considering the magnitude of the crime, nature and enormity of the allegations, character of evidence on record and the apprehension that the witnesses may be influenced and the allegations against her, i am unable to show any consideration to her,"" said saini who added that considering her ""extremely dignified conduct"" in the court he would have wished to give her ""some consideration of being a woman"".as the verdict was announced, most of her supporters broke down seeing her being taken into

said.investigating agencies have meanwhile probed top telecom corporate. sandeep basu, ceo of loop telecom was earlier questioned by the cbi.the probe agencies are trying to unravel the ownership pattern of the telecom companies.for instance, shipping stop dot com now loop telecom, had got 21 united access services (uas) licences but its authorised capital was only `5.2 crore against a requirement of `128 crore.the computer software company had misrepresented facts and was not eligible for grant of an uas licence.similarly s tel had got six uas licences but submitted false certificates regarding paid up capital, among others.arun mandhana, cfo and rupinder sikka, another top official of the company have already been questioned by cbi.the third company, data com services (now known as videocon telecommunications), had submitted a false certificate about the paid-up capital and got uas licences for 21 circles.the company's authorised capital according to a cag report was just `1 lakh against requirement of `138 crore. videocon's raj kumar dhoot, a rajya sabha mp, has been questioned by the cbi.meanwhile, official sources stated that after the third charge sheet is filed, the cbi will focus on the period starting from 2001 onwards.top cbi officials maintained that no business tycoon or a business house had been given a clean chit.why she is under lenscharges

md sharad kumar in the 2g spectrum scam case after two of the judges recused from hearing the matter.kanimozhi is likely to face some tough time in convincing the court to grant her bail as the case will be heard by a bench headed by justice g s singvi, who has been monitoring the case since the beginning and had asked searching questions to the government on the role of several influential people in the multi-crore scam.it would be the last hope for dmk chief m karunanidhi's 43-year-old daughter kanimozhi, who has been in jail for almost a month, after her plea was rejected first by the special cbi court and then by the delhi high court.kanimozhi and kumar have been accused by the cbi to be involved in the illegal transaction of rs 200 crore to kalaignar tv which was alleged to be a bribe given by a telecom operator which had benefited in the scam.the cbi in its affidavit filed in the apex court opposed their bail pleas on the ground that if released, they could tamper with evidence and influence witnesses.earlier two judges -- p sathasivam and a k patnaik -- before whom the matter was listed had recused themselves from the high-profile case.instead, justice singhvi, whose bench has been monitoring the case, will tomorrow hold a special hearing along with justice b s chauhan to decide the bail.according to informed sources, justices p sathasivam and a k patnaik conveyed their decision to recuse to chief justice s h kapadia, following which he constituted another bench.opposing the bail plea, the probe agency contended in its affidavit that kanimozhi and kumar were key conspirators and rs 200 crore transferred to kalaignar tv was part of the ""bribe"" amount and not a loan as claimed by the accused.the central agency submitted the special cbi court and later the delhi high court carefully evaluated material evidence and other factors to refuse bail to them.the apex court had on june 13 agreed to hear their bail plea and asked cbi to explain where the rs 200 crore, allegedly diverted to dmk-owned kalaignar tv in 2g scam, has gone and also to file a response on their bail pleas in a week's time.the court had also asked cbi to come out with a status report on the loss to the state exchequer due to the award of 13 licences to one of the telecom operators and trial proceedings in the cbi special court.kanimozhi and kumar had moved the apex court seeking bail on june 10 challenging the delhi high court verdict that rejected their bail on the ground that they have strong political connections and the possibility of them influencing

2012-09-08,textbook case of crony capitalism,"there's an uncanny similarity between the 2g spectrum scam and the ongoing sound and fury over coalgate as it has come to be known. coalgate once again throws into stark relief the cosy crony capitalism that exists in the country and which works actively towards the detriment of people's interests.in the us, the same architecture resulted in a crackdown propelled by the effective mechanism of the sarbanes oxley act. of course, i must hasten to add that it was only a while before human ingenuity found yet another outlet using complex derivative instruments to trip the world's financial markets in 2008. the world is still to recover from it four years later. this sordid nexus between businessmen - small and big - politicos and sections of the bureaucracy bared in the 2g scam has been regurgitated in coalgate 2012. ugh! india's innate propensity to absorb these scams is something that global investors are questioning.mail today has been at the forefront of cracking the code on the manoj jayaswal-darda extended family working in cahoots to grab coal blocks; other media have highlighted similar tie-ups resulting in successful garnering of blocks. coal, like spectrum, is a natural national resource, precious and scarce. why should people be allowed to garner it without paying top dollar?virgin coal blocks given out as giftsthe answer given is that coal blocks were given to different entities because they were in the power, cement and steel businesses and hence needed captive mines. that as many as 56 of the 57 blocks are still virgin is another matter altogether. in the case of spectrum, at least the beneficiaries forked out rs 1,658 crore each for a unified access service licence, but as the events subsequent to the supreme court ordering the cancellations have shown, the true market-determined value of the surrendered spectrum will be closer to rs 20,000 crore for each licence (in auction conditions), given that the reserve price is rs 14,000 crore.so, was cag wrong in its presumptive loss prognosis? no. similarly, the value of the coal blocks lying unused and unexploited is only growing. and if they are auctioned, then the real value will be unveiled.a five-day-old company j.r. power gen headed by union minister of state for information and broadcasting s. jagathrakshakan was awarded a coal block in 2007 when it signed a memorandum of understanding with stateowned puducherry industrial promotion development and investment corporation. jagathrakshakan belongs to the dmk. his defence is that he was neither an mla nor an mp in january 2007. the coal block saw a change in ownership when j.r. power sold 51 per cent of its stake to hyderabadbased ksk energy ventures. gain or loss?similarly, ist steel and power, a spanking-new associate company owned and run by former corporate affairs minister prem chand gupta's sons mayur and gaurav, received a coal block in maharashtra. the coal ministry has since issued a show-cause notice to ist steel.a. raja favoured a handful of operators on a first-come-first-served basis.earlier, there was a case involving tourism minister subodh kant sahay's brother sudhir, who was an 'honorary' director (that is, he did not own any shareholding) in one of the companies that was allocated a coal block - sks ispat. what sahay conveniently forgot to address while defending himself was that in his letter of recommendation to the prime minister on these two blocks, he chose not to mention his brother's association with sks.this kind of crony capitalism is rampant across the coal block allocation rainbow. this preferential allotment of coal blocks is at the heart of the latest corruption scandal that threatens to engulf the government. a classic textbook illustration of crony capitalism -

2012-10-19,what is the 2g spectrum scam?,"the 2g spectrum scam involved politicians and government officials in india illegally undercharging mobile telephony companies for frequency allocation licenses, which they would then use to create 2g subscriptions for cell phones. the shortfall between the money collected and the money which the law mandated to be collected is estimated to be rs 1,76,645 crore, as valued by the comptroller and auditor general of india based on 3g and bwa spectrum auction prices in 2010. india is divided into 22 telecom zones, with 281 zonal licenses in the market. according to the telecom policy of india, when a licence is allotted to an operator, some start-up spectrum is bundled along with it. in 2008, 122 new second-generation (2g) unified access service (uas) licences were given to telecom companies at a price arrived at in 2001 and on a first-come-first-serve basis.zero-loss theoryamid claims of various amounts of loss suffered by the

cost of the public exchequer"" and ""virtually gifted away important national asset"".sibal's ""zero loss theory"" was demolished on august 3, 2012, when as per the directions of the supreme court, the government of india revised the base price for 5 mhz 2g spectrum auction to rs 14,000 crore, which roughly gives the value of spectrum to be around rs 2,800 crore per mhz which is close to the

2017-12-28,"2017 in indian politics: bjp continues dominance, midnight dramas abound, 'neech' politics prove a distraction","there is never a dull moment in politics. especially so, when it is indian politics.2017 in indian politics saw the bharatiya janata party continue its electoral dominance even as india's grand old party, the congress, attempted a turnaround.there were also plenty of moments that surprised (the choice of chief minister in uttar pradesh), befuddled (a politician sitting on public meditation at midnight), and awed the electorate (a party's ability to win a state despite losing its election).here's recapping the year's top political moments:midnight meditation at marina around the turn of the year, all was (mostly) well in tamil nadu politics. yes, there was a power vacuum left behind by the death of j jayalalalithaa, the beloved tamil nadu chief minister and aiadmk supremo who died in december 2016.but, that vacuum was being filled pretty smoothly. ottakkarthevar panneerselvam, a long-time aiadmk loyalist, had replaced jayalalithaa as cm within hours of her death. and come january, amma's close aide vk sasikala was on the homestretch of a plan that would see her become cm.and as an apparent part of this plan, o panneerselvam resigned from the cm's post on february 5. pretty straight-forward politics, so far.it all changed on february 7 when panneerselvam made a late-night dash to jayalalithaa's memorial at marina beach and sat there on meditation. he did not utter a word even as curious onlookers, befuddled supporters and startled journalists gathered around.o panneerselvam at jayalalithaa's memorial on february 7 (pti)finally, after a 40-minute meditation session, panneerselvam awoke, said 'amma's soul had called out to him', and declared war on sasikala. he said he would ""continue to work in amma's name"" and take back his resignation if people were with him.the night pushed tamil nadu politics into turmoil. panneerselvam wasn't able to hold on the cm's chair (though he ultimately joined hands with his successor edappadi palaniswami and became deputy cm), nor was sasikala, thanks to a criminal conviction, able to become the chief minister.aiadmk still remains divided into warring factions and the state's politics saw a fresh twist this month when ttv dhinakaran, sasikala's nephew and part of the camp railing against the ops-eps combine, won the by-poll in rk nagar, the assembly seat vacated by late jayalalithaa.the man from gokrakhpur the political firestorm that followed the narendra modi government's shock demonetisation decision from november 2016 was very much raging in 2017. and in march, note ban, just one of the many expressions used to describe the invalidation of rs 500 and rs 1,000 notes, became an election issue in uttar pradesh.the ruling samajwadi party joined hands with the congress to take on the bharatiya janata party. unsuccessfully so. the bjp, led by the master campaigner narendra modi, won a staggering three-fourths majority in lucknow.the bjp won a landslide victory in the uttar pradesh election (indiatoday.in)click here to enlargethe biggest surprise of the election was what happened after the results were announced: the appointment of yogi adityanath, a firebrand saffron leader and a four-time mp from gorakhpur, as chief minister.adityanath's becoming uttar pradesh cm was widely critiqued by commentators, both positively and otherwise, and his decisions as chief minister were intensely scrutinised.fast-moving bjp catches congress coldif uttar pradesh was the headline of the five-state assembly elections from march this year, then manipur and goa were its post-scripts. of the five states, the bjp won in two (up and uttrakhand), lost in one (punjab) and finished second in the remaining.in goa and manipur, neither of which gave a majority to a single party, the congress won the most number of seats. however, it was the bjp that ended up forming governments in both the states, and ending with 4-1 tally in the five-state polls.once the results were announced on march 11, the bjp moved quickly to stitch up alliances with local parties and - the very next day -announced it had enough numbers to form governments in both the states.the bjp came second in goa and manipur, but still managed to form governments in both the states (ap)pm modi sacrificed his defence minister - manohar parrikar - so that he could return to his home state goa as chief minister (a condition alliance partners in the coastal state put forth for their support) while in manipur the party managed to secure the backing of two independent mlas, a tmc legislator and even a congress defector.the congress claimed the bjp had used money power to 'steal' the two states, but it is worth noting that while saffron party had vote share in goa and manipur even though it ended up fewer seats than the grand old party.mahagathbandhan no more on july 26 evening, bihar chief minister nitish kumar resigned from his post. the next day morning - barely over 12 hours after he resigned - nitish was at bihar's raj bhavan taking the oath of office, once again, to become the state's chief minister, once again.the hours between saw the spectacular end of the 'mahagathbandhan', a grand alliance starring nitish's janata dal (united) (jdu) and lalu prasad yadav's rashtriya janata dal, and the bihar cm's return to the nda fold.nitish's july 26 evening resignation, a result of his discontent over allegations of corruption against his deputy and lalu's son tejashwi, was followed by a series of 'coincidences'.moments after he announced his decision to step down, the bjp, which just happened to be holding a parliamentary meeting in new delhi, announced it would support the jd (u) in bihar. soon after, mlas of the two parties managed a late-night meeting in patna and signed letters of approval backing nitish's return to the cm's chair.2017 saw nitish kumar's return to the nda fold (reuters)in between, pm modi, on twitter, praised nitish for ""joining the fight against corruption"", nitish replied with a thank you and the rjd raged. tejashwi, left to hold the fort with father lalu having to (coincidently) travel to ranchi for a court hearing, even embarked on a post-midnight march to raj bhavan in protest of the developments. but, it all came to naught. nitish was sworn in as chief minster on july 27 and on july 28, won an assembly floor test, bringing about the end of the mahagathbandhan that just two years earlier had handed the bjp a humiliating defeat in the 2015 bihar election.election at midnight this was the third major political moment of the year for which journalists and writers liberally - and justifiably - used the phrase 'midnight drama'. the usually dull rajya sabha elections were an electric, nail-biting affair in gujarat this year, with results for the polls coming only after midnight on august 8.as polling began on august 8, congress' ahmed patel needed the support of 45 mlas to win. and, the congress had 51 mlas in the gujarat assembly.however, thanks to cross-voting, patel apparently managed the support of just 44 mlas, one short of the number required to win his re-election.and so, as day turned into night, the congress went to the mattresses. counting was held up for six hours as the election commission office in new delhi was besieged by delegations from the congress and the bjp.the grand old party alleged two of its mlas had broken voting rules by showing their ballots to bjp chief amit shah and union minister smriti irani (the two were contesting the other gujarat rajya sabha seats which they won comfortably). the bjp, on the other hand, wanted the poll panel to get on with the counting.finally, close to midnight the election commission ruled in favour of the congress and disqualified the votes of the two mlas in the question. this brought the number needed to win down to 44, which meant that nearly at 1.53 am august 9, ahmed patel was able to tweet this:this is not just my victory. it is a defeat of the most blatant use of money power,muscle power and abuse of state machinery- ahmed patel (@ahmedpatel) august 8, 2017of pakistan and 'low-life'more than a 'top moment' this marked a low for indian politics in 2017. in the heat of the gujarat assembly election, political attacks turned ugly and below-the-belt comments were common.the two incidents that stood out for how they dominated the popular discourse were mani shankar aiyar's 'neech kisam ka aadmi' comment and prime minister modi's insinuation that ex-pm manmohan singh conspired with pakistani diplomats and officials to influence the gujarat election.aiyar's comment, directed at pm modi, saw him lose the primary membership of his party, the congress. his clarification (that he hadn't called the pm a 'low-born') and half-apology notwithstanding, pm modi went to town using the comment to corner the congress during his election rallies.at one of these rallies, while talking about the aiyar comment, pm modi suggested that ex-pm singh and former vice president hamid ansari secretly met with some pakistani officials at aiyar's residence in new delhi before the gujarat polls.the congress took umbrage at the pm's suggestion and the controversy continued even ar the gujarat election results, with the grand old party disrupting parliament over its demand that the prime minister apologise for his remarks.the impasse finally ended days before new year's eve, with finance minister arun jaitley saying the government does not question singh's or ansari's commitment to the nation and that it holds the former pm in high regard. the congress, in response, disavowed of any attacks that may have been made on pm modi, which was seen as a reference to aiyar's 'neech' remarks.honourable mentionsthe verdict in the 2g spectrum scam case was a shocker for many. in maharashtra, the shiv sena has announced plans to quit the state-level alliance with the bjp in the coming year.the supreme court, in january 2017 delivered a crucial judgement that held that political parties and politicians cannot seek votes in the name of caste, community, religion or language.and, speaking of electoral politics, 2017 also marked the year the election commission decided that all future elections will conducting using electronic voting machines connected to voter-verifiable paper audit trail (vvpat) devices.what will the future hold for indian politics? we would be foolish to predict that. but, what we can predict with certainty is that it will be as exciting as the year gone by.",0.14620113012636382,"2017 indian politics : bjp continues dominance , midnight dramas abound , '

2018-08-30,why rahul gandhi wants a jpc probe into rafale deal,"it was february 22, 2011 - the first day of the budget session when upa was in power. the then prime minister manmohan singh announced setting up of a joint parliamentary committee (jpc) into the alleged multi-crore 2g spectrum allocation scam. for the next three years till the 2014 lok sabha election, 2g had become one of the most important issues for the bjp to corner the ruling congress-led upa government.in a reversal of roles now, the congress is demanding a jpc probe into the rafale deal. congress president rahul gandhi has upped the ante over the issue. the ruling bjp has so far shown no inkling of giving in to rahul gandhis demand.why is rahul gandhi demanding a jpc probe into the rafale deal? what gains will the probe accrue to him and the congress party?if one looks at the history of all jpcs, one finds that they serve as an important political tool for the opposition party. so far, jpcs have been constituted on six occasions - bofors scam (1987), harshad mehta stock market scam (1992), ketan parekh share market scam (2001), soft drink pesticide issue (2003), 2g spectrum allocation scam (2011) and vvip chopper scam (2013).while jpc was first constituted in the bofors scandal when rajiv gandhi was the prime minister, the last two jpcs, including the one on 2g spectrum allocation, were formed during manmohan singhs second tenure as pm. coincidentally, every time that the jpc has been constituted, the government of the day has lost in the next lok sabha election.from the oppositions point of view, these are some of the five advantages of a jpc:building up heatany jpc inquiry helps the opposition in building up the heat on the ruling party of the day. the 2g did exactly that for the then main opposition party, the bjp. the congress and its upa partners were put on the defensive.the bjp kept demanding a jpc probe into 2g spectrum scam. when it was finally constituted, it remained in the news because if its meetings. documents and heated arguments during its meetings would also be leaked thus keeping the pot boiling all the time. the congress, therefore, wants the bjp to face the heat through a jpc on the rafale deal.read | rahul gandhi on rafale: we don't take pm modi seriously but expose his liesofficial sanctiona jpc probe provides an official sanction to an alleged scam. the bjp was luckier than the congress. the 2g spectrum scam found mention in comptroller and auditor generals report which pegged the loss at rs 1.76 lakh crore to the exchequer. the scam was probed by the cbi under the watch of the supreme court. the rafale deal has not been taken up by any of these bodies. in the absence of such factor, rahul gandhi and the congress may want a jpc inquiry for the rafale deal to get some kind of an official sanction.make scam stick to bjpwhatever may have been the truth in the bofors, 2g spectrum or the vvip chopper scams, they have got associated with the congress governments of the day. the jpc probe had a big role to play in all of these.the opposition parties, vp singhs janata dal and the bjp respectively, were successful in creating a perception among the people of wrongdoings by the government. the jpc probe came in handy for the opposition.if the congress succeeds in getting a jpc inquiry ordered, it would go to town with the deliberations of the jpc meetings and finally its report and all the controversies surrounding it.disrupting parliamentrahul gandhis demand for a jpc probe into the rafale deal may be a precursor to the worse things to come. it may be an alibi to disrupt the winter session of parliament. the whole winter session of parliament in 2010 had got washed out with the bjp demanding a jpc probe into the 2g scam. though the bjp created the ruckus, the ruling congress felt the heat.to escape any further embarrassment, the then pm manmohan singh announced the formation of jpc on 2g spectrum scam on the very first day of the 2011 budget session. the jpc meetings went on till more than two years and finally, its report was submitted by its chairman pc chacko to the then lok sabha speaker meira kumar on october 29, 2013.parliament was disrupted even on the adoption of the report. one may expect the same if a jpc probe is ordered into the rafale deal.electoral dividendfinally, the main motive. the bjp was successful in creating a perception about the congress government being corrupt. the jpc probe into the 2g spectrum scam played a key role. it provided a legitimacy for the bjp which went to the 2014 lok sabha election painting the congress-led upa government as corrupt. it paid rich dividends and the congress fared the worst in history winning just 44 of the 543 lok sabha seats.with no other scam having stuck to the narendra modi government so far, the congress smells a chance in the rafale deal. rahul gandhi has been trying to rake it up on all forums.now, his emphasis is on ensuring that a jpc is ordered into it so that he harvests its yield in the 2019 lok sabha election. presently, the bjp seems to have smelt the congress gameplan. hence, both finance minister arun jaitley and bjp president amit shah had outrightly rejected any jpc probe. the tug of war over jpc on rafale deal would be interesting in the days to come.read | arun jaitley says rahul gandhi peddling untruth on rafale deal, asks 15 questionswatch | demonetisation helped big businesses, ruined small ones: rahul gandhi",0.113,rahul gandhi wants jpc probe rafale deal,"february 22 , 2011 -
