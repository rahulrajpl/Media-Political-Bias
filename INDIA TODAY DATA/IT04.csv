(hindi version is attached):address by the president of india to parliament on june 9, 2014honourable members i am delighted to address this first session of both houses of parliament after the elections to the 16th lok sabha. let me begin by extending warm greetings to my fellow citizens, who participated in large numbers in the recently concluded lok sabha elections. we should never forget that we are here because of them. serving them should be our first priority. i also felicitate the members of the new lok sabha. you have successfully obtained the mandate from the electorate and now you represent their hopes, aspirations and dreams. i extend a warm welcome to all of you and hope that the sessions ahead with heavy legislative agenda will be productive and useful.2. it is a matter of great satisfaction that the recent general elections were smooth and largely peaceful. i would like to congratulate the election commission of india and the official machinery for conducting these elections successfully. the unprecedented interest shown by the people of india in the elections is a sign of progressive deepening of our vibrant democracy. before i dwell upon the tasks ahead of us, i would like to express my solidarity with the families of all those who lost their lives during the election process.3. i congratulate the new speaker of the lok sabha on her unanimous election to this august office. by successively electing women speakers, the lok sabha has re-affirmed our age-old belief in the importance of women in our society.honourable members4. this has been an election of hope. it marks a turning point in the evolution of our democratic polity. the surge in aspirations and the belief that these could be realized through democratic processes, has been amply reflected in the record 66.4% participation by voters, and a clear verdict in favour of a single political party after a gap of nearly 30 years. the electorate transcended the boundaries of caste, creed, region and religion to come together and vote decisively in favour of development through good governance.5. the country needed a strong and stable government that could provide effective leadership. in my republic day speech earlier this year, i had hoped for 2014 to be a year of healing after the fractured and contentious politics of the previous years. standing here today, i applaud the wisdom of my fellow citizens for having voted for stability, honesty and development in a resurgent india in which corruption will have no place. they have voted for a united, strong, and modern india - ""ek bharat - shreshtha bharat"". my government will work to fulfill these aspirations; with the involvement of all the 125 crore people of this great country.6. my government is committed to nurturing the right environment for actualizing this mandate of the people. for this, it pledges itself to the principle of 'sabka saath, sabka vikas'; which can be fulfilled only through your active participation. we will work together to re-establish the credibility of the institutions of democracy. my government will function on the mantra of 'minimum government, maximum governance'. in all our actions, we will be guided by the core values of our great civilization.honourable members7. my government is dedicated to the poor. poverty has no religion, hunger has no creed, and despair has no geography. the greatest challenge before us is to end the curse of poverty in india. my government will not be satisfied with mere ""poverty alleviation""; and commits itself to the goal of ""poverty elimination"". with a firm belief that the first claim on development belongs to the poor; the government will focus its attention on those who need the basic necessities of life most urgently. it will take necessary steps to provide security in its entirety to all citizens; through empathy, support and empowerment.8.containing food inflation will be the topmost priority for my government. there would be an emphasis on improving the supply side of various agro and agro-based products. my government will take effective steps to prevent hoarding and black marketing. it will reform the public distribution system, incorporating best practices from the states. my government is alert about the possibility of a subnormal monsoon this year and contingency plans are being prepared.9. despite more than two-thirds of our people living in rural areas; we have not been able to provide adequate public amenities and livelihood opportunities to them. my government is committed to improving the quality of life in our villages, through empowered panchayati raj institutions. a substantial part of investment will focus on creating community assets and improving basic infrastructure such as roads, shelter, power and drinking water. my government will strive to end the rural-urban divide guided by the idea of rurban; providing urban amenities to rural areas while preserving the ethos of the villages.10. agriculture is the source of livelihood for majority of our people. in the recent past, our farmers have been under severe stress with hopelessness driving some of them to suicides. my government is committed to reversing this unfortunate trend. it will increase investment in agriculture, both public and private, especially in agri-infrastructure. steps will be taken to convert farming into a profitable venture through scientific practices and agro-technology. my government will address issues pertaining to pricing and procurement of agricultural produce, crop insurance and post-harvest management. productivity of animal husbandry will be increased. my government will incentivize the setting up of food processing industries. existing cooperative sector laws will be reviewed to remove anomalies and lacunae. my government will adopt a national land use policy which will facilitate scientific identification of non-cultivable land and its strategic development.11. each drop of water is precious. my government is committed to giving high priority to water security. it will complete the long pending irrigation projects on priority and launch the 'pradhan mantri krishi sinchayee yojana' with the motto of 'har khet ko paani'. there is a need for seriously considering all options including linking of rivers, where feasible; for ensuring optimal use of our water resources to prevent the recurrence of floods and drought. by harnessing rain water through 'jal sanchay' and 'jal sinchan', we will nurture water conservation and ground water recharge. micro irrigation will be popularised to ensure 'per drop-more crop'.honourable members12. india is the world's oldest civilization. today it is also a country with the largest population of the youth. we must equip and nurture our youth with the right kind of education, skill-set and opportunity to reap this demographic dividend. my government will strive to transition from youth development to youth-led development. it will set up massive open online courses and virtual classrooms. it will formulate a national education policy aimed at meeting the challenges posed by lack of quality, research and innovation in our educational institutions. we will set up iits and iims in every state. in order to empower school teachers and students, a national e-library will be established. with the motto of ""har haath ko hunar"", my government will strive to break the barriers between formal education and skill development, and put in place a mechanism to give academic equivalence to vocational qualifications. with the goal of skilled india, my government will also launch a national multi-skill mission.13. the children and youth of the country need avenues of recreation that develop them constructively and keep them fit. my government will launch a 'national sports talent search system'. it will facilitate development and promotion of indian sports, particularly rural sports. sports will be popularised by making it an integral part of the school curriculum and providing educational incentives.14. our country needs a holistic health care system that is universally accessible, affordable and effective. to achieve this objective, my government will formulate a new health policy and roll out a national health assurance mission. it will promote yoga and ayush. to address the shortfall of health care professionals, health education and training will be transformed. aiims like institutes will be established in every state in a phased manner.15. we must not tolerate the indignity of homes without toilets and public spaces littered with garbage. for ensuring hygiene, waste management and sanitation across the nation a ""swachh bharat mission"" will be launched. this will be our tribute to mahatma gandhi on his 150th birth anniversary to be celebrated in the year 2019.16. keeping in mind welfare of the people belonging to the scheduled castes, scheduled tribes, other backward classes and the weaker sections of our society; my government will take steps to create an enabling eco-system of equal opportunity in education, health and livelihood. my government is committed to see that those belonging to the scheduled castes and other backward classes are able to avail emerging opportunities. for the scheduled tribes, my government will launch a dedicated ""van bandhu kalyan yojana"". electrification of tribal hamlets and connecting them with all-weather roads will be a priority area.17. it is unfortunate that even after several decades of independence, sections of minority communities continue to suffer from poverty, as benefits of government schemes do not reach them. my government is committed to making all minorities equal partners in india's progress. the government will especially strengthen measures to spread modern and technical education among minority communities and a national madarsa modernization programme will be initiated.18. the welfare and rehabilitation of specially-abled people is integral to my government's vision of a caring society. it will take steps to provide dignity of life to them by facilitating their participation in all walks of life. steps will be taken to identify their special needs and to provide institutional care to them.19. my government recognizes the important role our women play in the development of our society and growth of the nation. it is committed to providing 33 per cent reservation to them in the parliament and state legislative assemblies. with a commitment of ""beti bachao-beti padhao"", my government will launch a mass campaign for saving the girl child and enabling her education. it will structure a comprehensive scheme, incorporating best practices from states in this regard. in the recent past, the country has witnessed some grue some incidents of violence against women. the government will have a policy of zero tolerance for violence against women, and will strengthen the criminal justice system for its effective implementation.honourable members20. india is a federal polity. but, over the years, the federal spirit has been diluted. the states and the centre should function as an organic team india. in order to actively engage with the states on national issues, my government will reinvigorate fora like the national development council and the inter-state council. the centre will be an enabler in the rapid progress of states through cooperative federalism. state-specific development models will be developed taking into account the special needs and unique problems of coastal, hilly and desert areas. highest priority will be accorded to bring eastern region of the country on par with western region in terms of physical and social infrastructure. my government is committed to addressing the issues relating to development of andhra pradesh and telangana. the government will lay special emphasis on improving the intra-region connectivity and border infrastructure in the northeast as well as in jammu & kashmir. the issue of infiltration and illegal immigrants in the northeast region will be tackled on priority and all pending fencing work along the northeast border will be completed. special efforts will be made to ensure that kashmiri pandits return to the land of their ancestors with full dignity, security and assured livelihood.21. my government is committed to providing a clean and efficient administration focussed on delivery. the institution of lok pal is important to curb corruption and my government will endeavour to formulate rules in conformity with the act. my government will take steps to build the confidence and morale of our bureaucracy; enabling it with the freedom to work, and welcoming innovative ideas. the government will stress on putting in place transparent systems and timebound delivery of government services. government systems and processes will be revisited to make them citizen friendly, corruption free and accountable. efforts will be made to eliminate obsolete laws, regulations, administrative structures and practices. rationalization and convergence among ministries, departments and other arms of the government will be ensured to have focussed delivery. digitization of government records will be done for improving accessibility.22. e-governance brings empowerment, equity and efficiency. it has the power to transform peoples' lives. the backbone of my government's new ways of working will be a digital india. it will be used to drive re-engineering of government processes to improve service delivery and programme implementation. we will strive to provide wi-fi zones in critical public areas in the next five years. my government will rollout broad band highway to reach every village and make all schools e-enabled in a phased manner. technology will be used to prepare our children for a knowledge society. the national e-governance plan will be expanded to cover every government office from the centre to the panchayat; to provide a wide variety of services to citizens. emerging technologies like social media will be used as a tool for; participative governance, directly engaging the people in policy making and administration.23. my government is determined to rid the country of the scourge of corruption and the menace of black money. as a first step in this direction, the government has already constituted a sit to unearth black money stashed abroad. this will be followed up vigorously by proactively engaging with foreign governments.24. keeping in mind that justice delayed is justice denied, my government will adopt a multi-pronged approach to address the problem of high pendency of cases in our judicial system. it will progressively modernize the courts to improve their operational efficiency, and start reform of the criminal justice system to make dispensation of justice simpler, quicker and more effective. it will initiate a mission mode project for filling vacancies in the judiciary and for doubling the number of courts and judges in the subordinate judiciary in a phased manner. the government will give special emphasis to the development of alternate dispute resolution mechanisms.honourable members25. on the economic front, we are passing through an extremely difficult phase. for two consecutive years, our gdp growth has been less than 5 per cent. tax collection has declined. inflation continues to be at an unacceptable level. thus, putting the indian economy back on track is paramount for my government. we will work together to usher our economy into a high growth path, rein in inflation, reignite the investment cycle, accelerate job creation and restore the confidence of the domestic as well as international community in our economy.26. my government will create a policy environment which is predictable, transparent and fair. it will embark on rationalisation and simplification of the tax regime to make it non-adversarial and conducive to investment, enterprise and growth. my government will make every effort to introduce the gst while addressing the concerns of states. reforms will be undertaken to enhance the ease of doing business. my government will follow a policy of encouraging investments, including through fdi; which will be allowed in sectors that help create jobs and assets.27. for rapid creation of jobs in the manufacturing sector, the government will strategically promote labour-intensive manufacturing. employment opportunities will also be expanded by promoting tourism and agro-based industries. my government will transform employment exchanges into career centres - connecting our youth with job opportunities in a transparent and effective manner through the use of technology as well as through counselling and training. the government will strengthen the pension and health insurance safety nets for labour force of all categories and would provide them access to modern financial services.28. we need to transform ourselves into a globally competitive manufacturing hub powered by skill, scale and speed. to this end, the government will set up world class investment and industrial regions, particularly along the dedicated freight corridors and industrial corridors spanning the country. my government will encourage the domestic industry to innovate and collaborate internationally. it will strive to move towards a single-window system of clearances both at the centre and at the states through a hub-spoke model.29. to strengthen our share in global trade, procedures will be simplified and trade infrastructure strengthened so as to reduce transaction time and costs. the ssi and handicraft sectors will be encouraged by providing them enhanced technological, marketing and investment support. export potential of this sector will be encouraged. my government will make every effort to improve the working conditions of our weavers in particular. it will also set up a task force to review and revive our msme sector.honourable members30. lack of robust infrastructure is one of india's major impediments. the government will chalk out an ambitious infrastructure development programme to be implemented in the next 10 years. a fast-track, investment friendly and predictable ppp mechanism will be put in place. modernization and revamping of railways is on top of the infrastructure agenda. my government will launch a diamond quadrilateral project of high speed trains. the country will have a network of freight corridors with specialised agri-rail networks for perishable agricultural products. investment in railways will be increased using innovative financing methods. expansion of railways in hilly states and northeast region and modernization of rail safety systems will be prime focus areas. we will encourage r&d and high level local manufacturing for railway systems. a fast, time-bound and well monitored programme for execution of the national highways programme will be initiated, to overcome the stagnancy of the past few years. low cost airports will be developed to promote air connectivity to smaller towns. the government will evolve a model of port-led development. our long coastline will become the gateway for india's prosperity. my government will facilitate modernization of existing ports on one hand, and development of new world class ports on the other. stringing together the sagar mala project we will connect the ports with the hinterland through road and rail. inland and coastal waterways will be developed as major transport routes.31. my government will come out with a comprehensive national energy policy and focus on development of energy related infrastructure, human resource and technology. the aim of the government will be to substantially augment electricity generation capacity through judicious mix of conventional and non-conventional sources. it will expand the national solar mission and connect households and industries with gas-grids. reforms in the coal sector will be pursued with urgency for attracting private investment in a transparent manner. the international civil nuclear agreements will be operationalized and nuclear power projects for civilian purposes will be developed.32. my government is conscious of the fact that our urban infrastructure is under severe stress. soon, 50 per cent of our population would be residing in urban areas. taking urbanization as an opportunity rather than a challenge, the government will build 100 cities focussed on specialized domains and equipped with world class amenities. integrated infrastructure will be rolled out in model towns to focus on cleanliness and sanitation. by the time the nation completes 75 years of its independence, every family will have a pucca house with water connection, toilet facilities, 24x7 electricity supply and access.honourable members33. while putting the country on a high growth path, my government will keep sustainability at the core of our planning process. my government strongly believes that environmental conservation can go hand in hand with development. to achieve this, environment and forest clearance systems will be made more predictable, transparent and time-bound. simultaneously, an effective system will be developed for sound appraisal processes and strict compliance of clearance conditions, especially those relating to rehabilitation of displaced communities and regeneration of forests. cleaner fuels will be promoted to bring down pollution levels in our cities. the government will earnestly take up mitigation works to meet the challenges posed by climate change and will closely work with the global community in this regard. conservation of himalayan ecology will be a priority area for my government. a national mission on himalayas will be launched.34. in the recent past, serious concerns have been expressed regarding use of discretionary powers in allocation of our precious natural resources. the government will formulate clear and transparent policies on allocation of critical natural resources such as coal, minerals and spectrum.35. river ganga is a part of our rich cultural heritage, a symbol of faith and the lifeline for millions. however, ganga continues to remain polluted with many stretches of the river becoming dry in lean season. my government will take all necessary steps to ensure a perennial, clean and pristine ganga.36. our rich cultural heritage is the very foundation on which rests the unity of our diverse nation. indian languages are repositories of our rich literature, history, culture, art and other achievements. my government will launch a national mission ""e-bhasha"" that will develop digital vernacular content and disseminate our classic literature in different languages. my government will also provide the required resources for the maintenance and restoration of national heritage sites.37. india has a vast untapped potential for tourism which can play a special role in our socio-economic progress. the government will initiate a mission mode project to create 50 tourist circuits that are built around specific themes. with a view to encouraging pilgrimage tourism, a national mission for beautifying and improving the amenities and infrastructure at pilgrimage centres of all faiths will be launched.38. my government recognises the central role of science and technology in raising the quality of life. it will encourage and incentivise private sector investments, both domestic and foreign, in science and technology and in high-end research aimed at nurturing innovation. my government will build world class research centres in the fields of nanotechnology, material sciences, thorium technology, brain research, stem cells, etc. the government will also establish institutes of technology for rural development and a central university of himalayan studies.honourable members39. the government will maintain utmost vigil in the area of internal security. a policy of zero tolerance towards terrorism, extremism, riots and crime will be pursued. the states will be assisted for modernizing police infrastructure and equipment to tackle new forms of terrorism including narco terrorism and cyber threats. a national plan will be chalked out in consultation with the state governments to effectively curb incidents of communal violence and the challenges posed by left wing extremism. my government will take steps to equip the security forces with the latest technology and to improve their working conditions.40. my government will carry out reforms in defence procurement to increase efficiency and economy. it will encourage domestic industry, including the private sector; to have a larger share in design and production of defence equipment. we will introduce policies to strengthen technology transfer, including through liberalised fdi in defence production. with readily available skilled human resource, india can emerge as a global platform for defence manufacturing including software, which will strengthen our defence and spur industrial development as well as exports.41. the country is proud of its armed forces. they serve the nation with professionalism, dedication and valour; securing our nation and supporting relief and rescue operations in the wake of disasters and calamities. we will strengthen defence preparedness by modernising our armed forces and addressing the shortage of manpower on priority. recognising the importance of coastal security, my government will set up a national maritime authority.42. my government will do everything to repay the debt of our brave and selfless soldiers. it will appoint a veterans commission to address their grievances, so that they know that we don't stop caring for them when they retire from active service. the government will build a national war memorial to honour the gallantry of our soldiers. one rank, one pension scheme will be implemented.honourable members43.india's foreign policy, with its civilizational roots and heritage, is based on the principles of developing peaceful and friendly relations with all countries. we will pursue our international engagement based on enlightened national interest, combining the strength of our values with pragmatism, leading to a doctrine of mutually beneficial relationships. my government is committed to building a strong, self-reliant and self-confident india; regaining its rightful place in the comity of nations.44. my government sent a unique and bold signal to the south asian region and the world, by inviting for the first time in independent india, leaders of all south asian neighbours to the swearing-in ceremony of the new council of ministers on may 26. we are grateful to them for accepting the invitation at such a short notice. their participation, as also the gracious presence of the prime minister of mauritius; not only added sheen to the ceremony, but also represented a celebration of democracy in the region and convergence of our shared hopes and aspirations. this shows my government's commitment and determination to work towards building a peaceful, stable and economically inter-linked neighbourhood which is essential for the collective development and prosperity of the south asian region. we will further work together with south asian leaders to revitalise saarc as an effective instrument for regional cooperation and as a united voice on global issues.45. at the same time, we will never shy away from raising issues of concern to us at a bilateral level. we emphasize that the future of shared prosperity can only be built on the foundation of stability in the region, which requires sensitivity to security concerns and an end to export of terrorism to neighbours.46. my government will engage energetically with other neighbours in our region, including china, with whom we will work to further develop our strategic and cooperative partnership. we will strive to make progress in the many initiatives that are ongoing with japan, especially in the field of building modern infrastructure in our country. russia remains a privileged and strategic partner and my government will build further on the firm foundations of this relationship.47. india and the united states have made significant progress in developing strategic partnership over the years. my government will bring a renewed vigour to our engagement and intensify it in all areas, including trade, investment, science and technology, energy and education. india also values its broad-based cooperation with europe. the government will make concerted efforts to achieve progress in key areas with the european union as well as its leading members.48.to fully realize our softpower potential; there is a need to integrate it into our external interchange, with particular emphasis on our rich spiritual, cultural and philosophical heritage. the government will revive brand india riding on our strengths of 5t's: tradition, talent, tourism, trade and technology.49.across the world, we have a vibrant, talented and industrious indian diaspora that is a source of great pride for us. they have done pioneering work in diverse fields, held the highest public offices and have worked hard to support their localities and families in india. while they have contributed immensely to their adopted country, they also carry a little flame of india in their hearts that can light up the promise of change in our country. a hundred years ago, in 1915, india's greatest pravasi bharatiya, mahatma gandhi, returned home and transformed the nation's destiny. the next pravasi bharatiya diwas in january 2015 will thus be a special occasion. as we celebrate the centenary of gandhiji's return to india, we would also take steps that would deepen every pravasi bharatiya's connection with india and involve them in india's development.honourable members50. the people of india have given a clear mandate. they want to see a vibrant, dynamic and prosperous india. they want to see a resurgent india regaining the admiration and respect of the international community. brimming with hope and expectation, they want quick results. with three ds of democracy, demography and demand on our side, india is poised to actualize these aspirations. we must rise to the occasion to fulfill these great expectations. in 60 months from now, we should be able to say with confidence and pride that we have done it.jai

modi is a lucky man that he has got the opportunity, but who is responsible for it this is congress party and other regional parties.q. so you are saying if the point that congress party and regional parties come together in 2014 general election you feel they could have given modi a stronger fight?a. yes, now alsoq. and now also to if they have to survive they have to come together, so nitish and lalu have to come together, mayawati and mulayam have to come together, mamata and left also?a. no ..no. nitish and lalu, we have seen their results. if they were together in the alliance bjp would have lost the election. if mayawati ji and mulayam singh is together in up , bjp will lose the election . maharashtra you have seen, they were not together , because of sharad pawar, shiv sena has done good things.q. what about left and mamata?a. on left - in bengal , they are finished now.q. but are you therefore ready to reach out to them?a. no,-no no , they have some ideology, i have some ideology. our ideological fight will continue, but what i want to say for the better interest of this country to combat the communal vandalism and to fight against the arms vendetta, let us do a platform from where we can just we can raise the voice of the people. now a days, if you raise the voice, they will be just killing you like this, political killings, so it is basically.q. so, i can actually see a possibility of you sharing a platform with a sitaram yechury and prakash karat? as a platform, you are ready to share with them??a. that is a common minimum agenda. it is just like a platform to fight against communalism - the secularism.q. that is a big change that is taking place then..a. no no no in secularism..dekho no no no. internationally you have to remember..i attended this seminar. i went to vietnam along with them because this was a country representation at international level.q. but politically are you ready?a. politically. they gave support fully to upa, sometime they gave full support to nda. i was with nda but that time jaswant singh was the finance minister. one day he told me ""mamataji, hamne state government ko left front ko poora rupya de diya. then suddenly usko pata hua ki mamata toh uska khilap mein hai. toh humko bolta hai..nahi nahi nahi kiya bol diya. main ne bola theek hai kyon aapko aisa bolta hai. toh everybody is not that.""q. everybody can come together at times. you have done with nda in the past, you have been upa..a. but i was not with bjp propaganda. i was not with bjp's communalism agenda.q. so you will never be with narendra modi?a. no.q. no question at all?a. no. i was with bjp...atal behari vajpayee ji when he was the prime minister because of his credentials. that time we thought that yes he can lead the country. and this time it is not narendra modi. it is their party, they have got the majority. in democracy this is the system. what can i do?q. therefore, let me ask you in conclusion. do you accept the view that most people believe that narendra modi is here for 10 years that rahul gandhi needs to change, needs to really wake up and the congress party needs to wake up if it is to fight narendra modi. do you concede that. you said in this programme that if congress did more, do you believe that congress party needs to wake up or is it finished??a. finished hai..i cannot say.q. you have come to delhi and participated in nehru's centenary celebration where you shared the stage with sonia gandhi and with the left. am i to understand that this is the beginning of a new political alliance? mamata is now ready to reach out to congress and to the left?a. no, i was not sitting on the stage. but down, you can say in the audience.q. but you have prakash karat, sitaram yechury, with rahul gandhi?a. no, no, i have not distributed the seat or i have not given the number of the seat, who will sit where. it is the congress party, they invited us. they have decided who will sit where. that is their gesture. i think the program is pandit nehru's birthday. panditji was the first prime minister of india and architect of modern india and especially unity in diversity was his original thinking and that's why to fight the battle against the communalism it is a good platform.q. it's not a new political alliance. you are saying it's a platform to fight communalism. let me ask you then, you are saying the left, trinamool congress, congress, janta parivar will all come together to fight the bjp?a. i can't say because i just came to attend this meeting and was just an invitee. if everybody is together to fight the battle against communal forces, i will be happy and i don't want any blessings for that and i don't want any advantage for that also. let them do the things. i think that communalism is the cancer of our society and if we have to protect the humanity and the unity and integrity of this country than we will have to fight the communal forces.q. let me get it clear. you are saying you will be happy if all these forces come together. the janta parivar has already indicated that they will come together under mulayam singh yadav's leadership, nitish kumar, lalu, devegowda and others. you are now also saying that you are ready to come together on one platform that means a common strategy may be in parliament. you are ready for that?a. i am ready for that but let the other people also decide, floor management system and floor coordination. if that is done than we can raise the important public views also for that. because what i am feeling today is that very bad tendency is going on when you cannot combat the situation politically or you cannot do the development things than only alternative to divide the country like this and i don't support this. and i feel in delhi also you have seen the riots, uttar pradesh also, bihar also gujarat also, throughout the country this communalism is increasing. isi liye main soch rahi hoon ki sab mil kar kaam karen to accha hai. (that's why i am thinking that it will be good if everyone works together).q. jab sab ek saath kaam karenge to iska matlab hai ki aapko narendra modi ka virodh karna hai. narendra modi jaise jaise bade hote jaa rahe hain, aaplog sab dar gaye hain aur aaplog ek saath aana chahte hain?a. ye baat theek nahi hai. kaun bada, kaun chhota ye to desh ki janta tai karegi. agar pehle se ye sab ek hota na...congress ki galti se hi to chunav ka yeh nateeja nikla. aur doosri baat yeh hai ki agar sab log chunav se pehle ek saath me, ek common minimum program agenda karte to 29 per cent me kisi ko desh ka power nahi milta.q. you spoke of federal front before election?a. yes, i am now also interested.q. and now you are including congress and left also as part of it? with left you have such a?a. no, my ideological fight will continue.q. with the left?a. yes, they have their own ideological policy; i have my own ideological policy. that's a different question.q. at national level?a. at national level, it is a platform to fight the battle against communalism and the vandalism.q. that means you are saying narendra modi is your enemy number one?a. i am not saying any man or individual. i have respect for everybody. but what i want to say that communalism is the cancer of our society. and in the name of communalism arms training camp is going on. in the name of communalism, crores of money is being spent. in the name of communalism, do you think we are fool? from where this money is coming?q. but bjp is saying in the name of minority appeasement mamata banerjee is only catering to ?a. see, my problem is when i am born in this country and on that day i am born i say yes i am committed to this country. if i continue to a chair the question of majority or minority does not arise. the question is i have to work for all. and we are for all, it may be hindus, buddhists, muslims, sikhs, christians and all.q. your are saying this today..a. no, no, no, i am not saying this today.q. please tell me mamataji, the bjp is slowly growing in bengal and the reason they say that mamata banerjee party is going to the extreme end to protect extremist fundamentalist muslim forces?a. do you think so?q. this is what amit shah has gone to bengal and said?a. who is this man? i don't know him? haven't seen him?q. he has gone to bengal and said this.a. politically, he can make these statements. but i don't care for that. i don't know these people. i know advaniji, i know vajpayeeji, i know rajnathji, i know arun jaitley, i know sushmaji. i know so many bjp leaders, congress party leaders and other party leaders also. i don't know all leaders of the bjp. it is not my duty also. but only one thing i can tell you. in bengal they will never never , even this time you have seen they have tried more and more. they spend a lot of money. even all the media have been purchased by them. i am sorry to say. it is a battle of sorrow. but instead of that i have got out of 42 we have got 34 seats. what they will give me the result...what they will doq. they are saying that their vote percent is now growing to 17 per cent, they are targeting 2016 elections in bengal and they are saying burdwan is a good example of kind of politics that the trinamool congress is playing. the homes that were raided where allegedly the bombs were found?.a. you will ask me the questions about today's meeting. no trinamool congress, it is absolutely wrong.q. is it propaganda?a. bjp's propaganda, rss' propaganda. it is their propaganda. it is not at all..and our state government arrested the persons and that house was hired in the month of july not before modi comes to power but after modi comes to power.q. so trinamool has no connection with thesea. no, why why why?..trinamool congress never do this. it is the bjp party. they divide the country. you see, i have a great respect for dharm gurus but i don't respect danga gurus. and i will not take any lessons from them. who is patriot and who is not patriot..because we are born and bought up in a state where we give the reforms. we give the social justice, we give the movement.q. the reason why narendra modi government has made that an issue because they said even when it comes to law and order, the nia has to go there eventually. the nsa has to go to burdwan because they felt the west bengal government was not willing initially..a. is it so? if they can say openly, yes they are not able. i can tell you i can expose them like anything. who said? nia, nsa said bengal government is doing all the good things. who arrested these persons? you have announced only the money. who arrested these main culprits?q. has infiltration grown?a. no tell me whose duty is this? when bjp party when they contested election, they raised the infiltration issue. they have forgotten once india was united. india, pakistan and bangladesh. whenever people came from bangladesh, they are infiltrators, they are not. up to indira gandhi- sheikh mujibur rahman pact, liyaqat-nehru pact..they are very much indian citizens. they have come from bangladesh within the stipulated time but what they are saying infiltration is whose responsibility? there are so many areas, borders; they are not within state government's jurisdiction.q. they say political violence has increased..a. no, no no?not at all. it has decreased 99 per cent. bengal is doing very good thing. they are giving some money to media and media is creating this confusion. i am sorry to say and i thing i can tell you, this infiltration..when they are raising the issue they must face the music. infiltration is not the state government issue. the border area depends on central government. where is your r&aw, where is your ib? where is you sib? where is your crpf, bsf, ssb? where? it is not state government's duty. 15 km within the border area is in the hands of bsf.q. now let me ask this, you are coming close to the congress, you are sharing a platform at a time when you are under political pressure for the first time?a. no no no, it is not political.q. for the first time in your career you have been accused by your political rivals of aiding corruption in the saradha scam?a. please. i will not give you the interview if you ask me all this questions. no you cannot accuse like this. first you have to prove. you have to give the evidence. it was never done in our time. it was the left front's time and congress' time and bjp's time.q. saradha has nothing to do with you? kunal ghosh your suspended mp says mamata was close to saradha group?a. who said? you have to prove it otherwise i will resign from my side.q. you will resign?a. yes. that is absolutely wrong i am telling you. it is cpm's time, left front's time..34 years not our times. we arrested the man. we set up the judicial commission. we return the money rs 5 lakh to individuals. this is absolutely wrong.q. you forgot the fact that your painting was sold for rs 1.8 crore. (mamata throws the mike)q. didi, tell me how do you see the narendra modi government? it's now been in power for almost six months. how do you see from a point of view of a chief minister, an opposition chief minister, how do you see the modi government today? do you believe that 'achhe din aa rahe hain'? do you accept that?a. na....achha din to....kahan se aa raha hai....wo videsh se aa raha hai lagta hai....desh mein to nahi hai....q. when you say 'videsh se aa raha hai', what are you saying? the foreign investors, the foreigners...(voice not clear)a. no, no....dekho, i am not against the foreign investment....lekin hum ye chahte hain ki hamara jo domestic industrialist hai usse jyada information...foreign ke saath milke wo kaam karenge, jayenge (voice not clear).....hamara koi aitraaz nahi hai....hum support karte hain investment ke liye....wo baat nahi hai....ek to foreign investment is different....dekho, hamara political policy hai, hum fdi retail market ko support nahi karte hain....hum....insurance jo aap pura bech de rahe hain, rail ko pura aap bech de rahe hain....usko hum support nahi karte hainq. you have been a former railway minister. government is saying fdi in railway, 100 percent they are willing to give in certain sectors - they are trying to reform the railways. are you against the reform?a. do you think it is a reform? if it is a reform, then he should have done it in the country, why outside?q. to bring more investments in key areas of the railways.a. ok, lekin aapke paas paisa nahi hai to kya aap ghar ka ladki ko bech dega -q. agar aapki jo facilities hain - if your railways are in decline, what is wrong if govt brings in better quality?a. dekho, railwayko - railway we say - railway is the lifeline of the nation - if the lifeline is derailed - itna din chala kaise - itne din bhi railway chala kaise - crores of people travel by railwayq. quality is going down.a. quality is going down because it is a lack of efficiencyq. it's not because several railways ministers including yourself in the past have been accused (voice not clear) - like lalu prasad, others. a. no, we have done a lot - don't compare me with others - ek, ek aadmi ka ek, ek kaam karne ka tareeka hota hai - i have a respect for all - lekin, this is not correct - that, our time railway was the best time telling you - without taking any advantage from outside even - and now, in the name of quality, if you sell total railway department, i don't know what will be - ok, you have no money na, you need more money, sell the country, that's an easy optionq. you are making an interesting point because abhishek banarjee, the tmc youth congress chief, who is your nephew, has said, narendra modi used to sell tea before becoming the prime minister - he is now selling the country away - i challenge him to take police action against me for such statements - i know i am saying the truth - do you think this is a kind of statements (voice not clear)a. let me tell you first thing - abhishek banerjee may be - don't tell me he is my nephew - he is my party workerq. but he is your nephew?a. so what? he is a party worker - i don't consider he is my family member.q. not your family member?a. no, no - yes, my family - he is in politics from childhood - it is not that....q. you are not promoting him?a. no - it is - they are doing their own business - they are the party fellow you can sayq. he heads the youth winga. that's ok - that party has decided - don't talk about family and all this - i believe human family is my family - and if anybody is interested in politics, anybody can come - if new generation - if they don't come - who will run the country next in the future - so, i.....q. opponents are criticising that you are promoting family....a. no, i am not -q. they never used to say this about youa. i am notq. you are still the same?a. i am still the same - if they have the quality, they will come - if they want to do something in the interest of the country, let them do - they have to work hard for this - they have to struggle - so, i struggle my full of life for this - so, don't say that - you can tell me - as your worker said - or tell me as what your mp said - but, yes, they can see - they are the young generation - (voice not clear) they are young and - this is the actual word they have saidq. no, but what you are saying -what he has said.....and what you also said. a. no, that may be their intentionq. no, i don't know what they said. q. are you saying the prime minister of the country is selling the country?a. i am not saying anything about my prime minister - i am telling you what is my feeling you asked me to tell the - all the ...railways (voice not clear) - because they want money - that's why i said if you want only money, then sell your countryq. what do you think about mr. modi's swachh bharat campaign?a. i am not saying anything because.....q. no, do you think it's a good campaign?a. no, no - swachh bharat kya hai - pahle aap to mere ko samjhao - swachh bharat kya hai - is it the nirmal gram programmes, earlier programmes?

2015-01-26,"heads held high on rajpath as flying sukhois, migs bring republic day parade to an end","military precision blended seamlessly with cultural diversity at india's 66th republic day parade on monday where us president barack obama was the chief guest. special: obama in indiamore than the pomp, this year's republic day parade on monday will be remembered for women's power showcased during the two-hour event and the presence of us president barack obama as the chief guest on the occasion.quite appropriately, the honour of leading the marching contingents was given to the one drawn from the three services, while the indian army, the indian navy and the indian air force also fielded all-women's contingents.the day began cloudy and rainy and there were apprehensions that the flypast, one of the most eagerly awaited events at the parade, would be curtailed but in the end the weather cleared sufficiently for this to take place.before the proceedings began, prime minister narendra modi, for whom it was his first republic day parade, drove to india gate to lay a wreath at the amar jawan jyoti memorial to the unknown soldier.he later drove to the saluting base at rajpath to welcome obama and president pranab mukherjee, who took the salute at the two-hour parade.before it commenced, mukherjee handed over posthumous ashok chakras - the nation's highest military award in peacetime - to the widows of major mukund vardarajan and naik neeraj kumar singh, who were killed in counter-insurgency operations in jammu and kashmir.as in the past, the marching contingents stole the show with their dazzling array of ceremonial uniforms, leaving the audience in the jam packed stands spoilt for choice: the blue and gold trimmed tunics of the 61 cavalry contrasting with the vivid red turbans of the brigade of the guards, the red-gold turbans of the jammu and kashmir light infantry and the green-blue turbans of a territorial army unit attached to the punjab regiment.most of the paramilitary and police contingents were in regulation khakhi but they too got a look-in thanks to their dazzling kamarbands, sashes and turbans.us president barack obama shakes hands with prime minister narendra modi in the pouring rain as he arrives to attend the republic day parade in new delhi. photo: reuters.notably, the mechanised columns were down to a minimum this time around - perhaps to paper over the fact that 70 per cent of the hardware with the armed forces is imported, a situation that modi's make in india initiative hopes to reverse.the music, as usual, made for considerable patriotic fervour, what with rousing tunes like sare jahan se accha, hanste lushai, kadam kadam badahe ja and sound barrier, many of which had obama keeping time - which he also did when the tableaux came on with their wealth of folk music.this also made for a seamless blend of military might and heritage as 25 tableaux - 16 from the states and nine from various ministries - graphically displayed india's rich cultural diversity.andhra pradesh chose to do this through a harvest festival; madhya pradesh highlighted the bhagoria festival of love and matchmaking; uttarakhand through the pilgrimage to kedarnath; sikkim through cardamom farming, assam by re-creating majauli, the world's largest river island; telangana by re-creating the golconda fort and haryana with a likeness of the sultanpur bird sanctuary - quite naturally, with twittering birds.the 'make in india' tableau by the department of industrial policy and promotion depicted a mechanised lion against the backdrop of a smart city. the campaign aims to promote manufacturing in india.another pet project of the prime minister, the 'beti bachao beti padhao' programme, a campaign against female foeticide which he launched from panipat in haryana jan 22, was also featured in a tableau.and, as usual, the flower-bedecked tableau of the central public works department drew loud applause. it featured the source of the ganga river high up in the himalayas.the weather began to lift as the tableaux were rolling down rajpath and just as the schoolchildren had finished their routines, three mi-35 attack helicopters of the iaf streamed in through the somewhat cloudy sky.then, in quick succession came the newly acquired c-130j super hercules medium-lift transport, the p8i maritime reconnaissance aircraft escorted by mig-29 combat jets (both of the indian navy, the c-17 heavy-lift transport escorted by sukhoi su-30 mki combat jets and the jaguars.here are live updates:12:04

during the two-hour event and the presence of us president barack obama as the chief guest on the occasion.quite appropriately, the honour of leading the marching contingents was given to the one drawn from the three services, while the indian army, the indian navy and the indian air force also fielded all-women's contingents.the day began cloudy and rainy and there were apprehensions that the flypast, one of the most eagerly awaited events at the parade, would be curtailed but in the end the weather cleared sufficiently for this to take place.before the proceedings began, prime minister narendra modi, for whom it was his first republic day parade, drove to india gate to lay a wreath at the amar jawan jyoti memorial to the unknown soldier.he later drove to the saluting base at rajpath to welcome obama and president pranab mukherjee, who took the salute at the two-hour parade.before it commenced, mukherjee handed over posthumous ashok chakras - the nation's highest military award in peacetime - to the widows of major mukund vardarajan and naik neeraj kumar singh, who were killed in counter-insurgency operations in jammu and kashmir.as in the past, the marching contingents stole the show with their dazzling array of ceremonial uniforms, leaving the audience in the jam packed stands spoilt for choice: the blue and gold trimmed tunics of the 61 cavalry contrasting with the vivid red turbans of the brigade of the guards, the red-gold turbans of the jammu and kashmir light infantry and the green-blue turbans of a territorial army unit attached to the punjab regiment.most of the paramilitary and police contingents were in regulation khakhi but they too got a look-in thanks to their dazzling kamarbands, sashes and turbans.us president barack obama shakes hands with prime minister narendra modi in the pouring rain as he arrives to attend the republic day parade in new delhi. photo: reuters.notably, the mechanised columns were down to a minimum this time around -

considerable patriotic fervour, what with rousing tunes like sare jahan se accha, hanste lushai, kadam kadam badahe ja and sound barrier, many of which had obama keeping time - which he also did when the tableaux came on with their wealth of folk music.this also made for a seamless blend of military might and heritage as 25 tableaux - 16 from the states and nine from various ministries - graphically displayed india's rich cultural diversity.andhra pradesh chose to do this through a harvest festival; madhya pradesh highlighted the bhagoria festival of love and matchmaking; uttarakhand through the pilgrimage to kedarnath; sikkim through cardamom farming, assam by re-creating majauli, the world's largest river island; telangana by re-creating the golconda fort and haryana with a likeness of the sultanpur bird sanctuary - quite naturally, with twittering birds.the 'make in india' tableau by the department of industrial policy and promotion depicted a mechanised lion against the backdrop of a smart city. the campaign aims to promote manufacturing in india.another pet project of the prime minister, the 'beti bachao beti padhao' programme, a campaign against female foeticide which he launched from panipat in haryana jan 22, was also featured in a tableau.and, as usual, the flower-bedecked tableau of the central public works department drew loud applause. it featured the source of the ganga river high up in the himalayas.the weather began to lift as the tableaux were rolling down rajpath and just as the schoolchildren had finished their routines, three

2015-10-01,"prasoon joshi, on having sachin tendulkar recite poetry for the swachh bharat anthem","in an exclusive conversation with india today, eminent lyricist prasoon joshi talks about his association with the swachh bharat campaign, working with sachin tendulkar, and how words followed by correct actions are the greatest tools to bring about change.how did your association with the clean india project (swacch bharat abhiyaan) come about?when prime minister narendra modi launched the swachh bharat abhiyan on october 2nd last year, he nominated nine renowned personalities to carry forward the baton of making the nation clean. anil ambani was one of them. anil then went ahead and nominated me along with eight other people, for which i'm extremely thankful. i was then roped in to compose a track for the entire movement. the track was called swachh bharat ka irada kar liya hum ne.tell us something about the anthem. what should we expect?the new track will be launched on october 2, 2015 marking one year of the campaign. the song has been composed by shankar-ehsaan-loy, produced by mukesh bhatt and features singers like kailash kher, alka yagnik, and shaan among others.but i think the fact that will excite everyone the most is sachin tendulkar's poetry recital in the song. lending my voice, support and more to a #swachhbharat. with @shankar_live, @prasoon_joshi, @supriyobabul pic.twitter.com/h2nbotku3k sachin tendulkar (@sachin_rt) september 28, 2015how do you feel, having a legend like sachin tendulkar on board?it is always great to be around sachin. not only because of the great player he is, but because of the great human that he is. i have interacted with him on various occasions but this was completely different.also read: sachin lends his voice to swachh bharat what was it like working with him, keeping in mind that poetry is an unexplored territory for him?it was wonderful. like the rest of the nation, i too am a great admirer of his. he does not take anything lightly and is extremely dedicated towards whatever he does. there is this certain honesty that he exudes, which is inspirational at so many levels. even when we were recording the track, he used to come up to us and say that he wanted to do better, and that he was not happy with the shot he'd given.picture courtesy: prasoon joshiyou've previously been a part of several other campaigns such as against domestic violence, polio etc. what made you take up this particular cause?there are some causes i feel strongly about. the campaign mann ke manjire featuring shubha mudgal was my humble effort to support the cause of women emancipation. being cynical and critical about everything is something that i dislike greatly. you can't just sit and wait for a change to occur overnight. in life, you always have a choice, to do something or to not do something. i chose the former and here i am. i strongly feel about our nation being clean and will make sure that i get to contribute in any way i can.also read: kailash kher talks about the campaign from being a physics graduate, to becoming one of india's most successful ad gurus, how did this enormous shift happen?let's just say, i stumbled upon it. poetry came to me instinctively, i loved the idea of creating something from scratch since i was a kid. i studied physics, then got a mba degree, but my thoughts kept resonating and i made it a point to keep practicing my craft.it's almost juvenile to ask you this, but do you think words can really be instrumental in changing the innate nature of humans?i think words have exceptional power. every word has the quality of making a difference. they either make a huge difference or a little difference, but they are impactful in one way or another.

2015-10-16,why is everyone talking about bhabhi ji ghar par hain? ,"the first thing that comes to our mind when we think of hindi television shows is that the daily soaps are full of melodrama, ott sets, acting, etc. so, a good comedy show is always a welcome change and is appreciated by the viewers. that's exactly the reason why sab tv's shows taarak mehta ka ooltah chashmah, fir or lapataganj were so popular among audiences. such is the popularity of taarak mehta ka ooltah chashmah that its team was among the nine people who were invited by pm narendra modi to take the swachh bharat initiative forward.recently, there's been a new show on the horizon that everyone is raving about. any guesses? sahi pakde hain, we are indeed talking about &tv's popular show bhabhi ji ghar par hain. if you follow television, you must have at least heard about the show, if not watched it yet. also read: bigg boss 9: rochelle-rimi and prince-suyyash are the new partners the show, featuring aashif sheikh, rohitash gaud, shilpa shinde and saumya tandon is insipred by the 1995 hindi sitcom shrimaan shrimati. if you have grown up in the 90s you must remember the popular show starring archana puran singh, rakesh bedi, reema lagoo and jatin kanakia. if not, what else is youtube for? aashif sheikh and shilpa shinde (picture courtesy: &tv)on the lines of shrimaan shrimati, bhabhi ji ghar par hain is about the lives of two neighbours, who love their wives, but don't miss a chance to woo each other's wives. set in kanpur, the show revolves around manmohan tiwari (rohitash gaud) who runs a business dealing with undergarments, his simple but slightly daft wife angoori (shilpa shinde), their neighbours vibhuti narayan mishra (aasif sheikh), who is unemployed, and his modern and smart wife anita (saumya tandon). the hilarious situations arise in the mens' bid to outdo each other and impress each other's spouse.also read: what happens when you put shahid, alia and kapil on one stage? set in kanpur, the show has all the local flavour and its script carries rustic humour. here are four reasons why people are loving the show and why it is a perfect watch on any given day:1. male protagonistsaashif sheikh and rohitash gaud (picture courtesy: &tv)although the show's title says it is about bhabhiji and both the ladies are the centre of attraction, it is the male protagonists who take the cake when it comes to making us laugh through their antics. aasif sheikh is especially good and totally nails the role of vibhuti. from speaking english in a fake accent to talking to his dear bhabhiji, he gets it just right. you can't stop yourself from smiling when he apologises by saying: ""i am saary, i am really saary."" his hamming too suits his character when he reacts to angoori bhabhi's stupidity or to people's insults or when he tries to be ultra cool. rohitash gaud aka tiwari ji too perfects his role as a rural businessman who is in awe of his modern neighbour. his usp is the perfect hindi in which he appreciates his favourite anita bhabhiji and his priceless reaction when he gets angry or frustrated. the silly banter between the two is also worth watching.2. characterssupporting cast of bhabhiji ghar par hain (picture courtesy: facebook)one of the main reasons of the show being such a hit is its characters. apart from the four leads, the other characters too are well crafted. be it a cop who asks for bribe by talking about how he has nine kids and a pregnant wife to take care of or the two roadside romeos that you can practically find in every other neighbourhood or the rickshaw puller or even the vegetable vendor, every character is so perfect in his/her mannerism that you are actually transported to a neighbourhood in a small town in uttar pradesh.3. dialect: the other aspect in which the show gets a perfect 10 is the dialect used by its characters. if you have ever been to the interiors of up or met someone from the area, you will understand what i am saying. yogesh tripathi, who plays daroga happu singh, aces his dialect as a cop from uttar pradesh. the two actors who play roadside romeos tika and malkan too hit the right spot when it comes to getting the dialect correct. even vibhutiji who tries to play all cool and sophisticated speaks in a total rustic way when speaking to his other neighbours. and angoori bhabhi's way of talking and her refrain 'sahi pakde hain' is already a rage among the viewers.4. catchphrases: be it angoori bhabhi's sahi pakde hain or hawaldaar happu singh calling bribe as neuchawar or tiwari ji talking about anita bhabhi's invisible sindoor (as she doesn't put 'vermillion): there are many catchphrases used in the show that have become very popular. it would not be an exaggeration to say that we have actually seen people saying 'sahi pakde hain' or saying i am sorry (read sarry) vibhuti style in their general conversation. catchwords used in the show too give a glimpse of the local flavour of up like the word ghuiyaan or chirand. rohitash gaud and saumya tandon (picture cortesy: &tv)the situations created in every episode coupled with the perfect acting (or overacting) by its actors, its famous catchphrases, the pitch-perfect dialects all result in a show that succeeds in tickling everyone's funny bone. the show gives you a happy feeling of life in a small town that is simple, laidback and yet interesting. a life that we all at some point of our daily struggle, yearn to have.what better way to spend your tv viewing watching a show that keeps you happy and smiling. as saxena ji, one of the characters of the show, says: i like it.",0.20300944989969386,everyone talking bhabhi ji ghar par hain ?,"first thing comes mind think hindi television shows daily soaps full melodrama , ott sets , acting , etc. , good comedy show always welcome change appreciated viewers.

""it has been two years since we gave the money to our pachayat to build toilets. they assure us every now and then that work will begin,"" claims najirpur resident bhabesh pramanik.more than fifty families of najirpur village have been deprived of the basic sanitation amenities despite each family paying up rs 900 for construction of a new toilet in the village. but two years down the line, the local panchayat is yet to begin any construction, forcing villagers to go out in the fields to answer nature's call.apart from hygiene issues, women in the village feel ashamed to go out in the fields to relieve themselves, especially during the daytime.""every morning, we are forced to go out in the fields. other villages have got new toilets built but we are still deprived. we are really ashamed but what do we do? we have no other option,"" says rekha, a resident of the same village.villagers claim they have informed the block district officer (bdo) of balurghat about the negligence of the panchayat.""two years have passed but nothing but the problem is not solved. we have informed the panchayat secretary several times but no action has been taken,"" laments another resident sudeb sarkar.the bdo on his part says his office had no idea about the situation in the village.

2016-09-12,skilling india: need for an integrated approach ,"sitting on the cusp of radical transformation, india aims for 'rapid changes not gradual evolution,' hence demanding 'actions, not (sheer) ideas, intent and promises'. on one hand national aspirations billed in schemes like 'swachh bharat', 'make in india', 'smart cities', 'skill india', 'digital india' and the likes demand a huge number of skilled hands giving effect to them. on the other hand, we find skill gaps and unemployability as the major hot button issues staring in the face of the nation. it is going to be an extensive, well-orchestrated effort. why does india need to skill its youth?india, with its demographic dividend of 144 million youth in 18-23 age bracket needs to, relevantly skill its youth to enable them to contribute to the country's growth process. for the big quantum leap, we wish to make in terms of progress.the cruciality of a skilled work force has already thrown the state machinery into action, leaving no stone unturned to meet the set targets and deadlines. a very ambitious 'skill india' initiative aims to train about 30 crores people by the year 2020. though it has been an inclusive approach there is a special thrust on those at the bottom of pyramid figuring around 800 million citizens.predicted talent crunchalso, it is predicted that the developed but ageing world may go through a talent crunch of over 56 million people by the year 2030. india can play a leading supplier of talent with around 47 million trained workers to fill-in this gap. government in full throttlethe central leadership is working full throttle to train and skill the youth through its various schemes and initiatives. under various efforts by the national skill development council, the government approach has been very elaborate, inclusive, inter-sectoral and integrated.the prime minister speaking at niti aayog recently reiterated the need to break the silos and develop cross sector functionality. the reference was to the government structure. but in the same construction, we can work in context of skill development. nsdc has been working across 32 sectors, covering 416 job roles to develop skills in the work force. governance has to be 'integrative'-- integrative of diversity in terms of sectors, functions, social and economic strata. prime minister's kaushal vikas yojana (pmkvy) working in the same spirit aims at providing 60 lakh youth with the opportunity to get trained assessed and certified. also, there are schemes taking care of the prior learning, and accordingly aligning the competencies of 40 lakh individuals from the unorganised workforce. pmkvy currently has over 74,000 enrolments. out of these, 20,000 have already completed their training and around 12,000 have been certified. need for skilled people to meet our aimsthose planning the trajectory of skill development have to plan along two very essential elements. the bigger picture they have, the skills required for the same and the human resources available at hand. these have to fall in place. let us work with the example of smart cities. needed skills will span over the sectors of power, sanitation and sewage disposal, horticulture, web services providers, public transport, it and many more. and the story isn't complete yet. also it will engage a huge number of engineers, architects, city planners, road layers, menial workers, masons, brick-layers, transporters, gardeners, daily wagers and a whole lot of skilled hands for the upkeep. with vision and prescience, we can ensure required skill sets are there.how to engage those not formally educated?we as a society are working to groom a reservoir of young talent that it is elite, educated and equipped with the latest breakthroughs in knowledge. but, what of the millions who have missed the bus of formal education? how do you engage them productively so they are integrated into the mainstream and don't end up on the wrong side of the law? skill them appropriately. educate them about the norms of work and life and give them the much needed dignity of labour. an offshoot of this is dipping crime rates.a society needs a broad spectrum of skills. it needs engineers, scientists, and doctors as much as it needs the sanitation workers or plumbers or electricians. an integrative and inclusive approach would give a holistic and sustainable solution to skill requirements. can we manage the country sans any one of the mentioned skill-set? imagine sanitation workers going on strike. need to complement cross-functionalitywe need to complement cross-functionality with excellence at all levels-- excellence that becomes the norm and abhors mediocrity. if india needs to be a global leader then it has to play a pivotal role in the world affairs and economy. as of now, even with its mammoth demography, that constitutes 18 per cent of the global population, india accounts only for two per cent of the global exports. hence, there is a need for excellence. ""the society which scorns excellence in plumbing as a humble activity and tolerates shoddiness in philosophy because it is an exalted activity will have neither good plumbing nor good philosophy: neither its pipes nor its theories will hold water,"" goes the adage.quality needs to be centre stage at all levels of educationin all our endeavours, quality needs to be centre stage-- starting from the schools to the institutions of higher learning. a substandard primary phase later metastasises into a stream of graduates that who do not have the required talent levels and skill sets, and there begins the chaos. having an army of youth flush with adrenaline but not knowing how to cater to the needs of self, organisation and the society is not of much use. we need to correct the narrative, which at times seems to have gone awry. basics are as important in the script of a worthy citizen as are the professional skills. primary education is the foundation of life. it has to be driven by conscientious professionals only. social and political structures are important skill development factorsit is not always the funds that fuel growth. many a time, it is the social and political culture we establish. a social structure that weaves into its young growing minds the discipline, commitment and sincerity towards their work and nation is essential. punch-ins or cameras can't inculcate what good education can-- discipline and attitudinal honesty. finally, an overhaul of the dated institutions can boost the production to a globally expected level. when we say production, it takes in its ambit goods, services, talent and human resources. functional silos are modern day dinosaurs. let us perpetuate the culture of cross functionality.skill india aims to train about 30 crores people by the year 2020. and this has to be an integrated bracket. the state machinery is already on the job. there are schemes, initiatives, special projects, kaushal melas (fair). we seem to be moving in the right direction though such changes take time.-authored by dr uday salunkhe, group director, welingkar institute of management development and research (weschool)read: studying

2016-09-26,sushma swaraj at unga: full text of the speech,"external affairs minister sushma swaraj did not leave any stone unturned in her efforts to condemn the perpetrators of terror during her speech at the united nations general assembly in new york.swaraj in her indisputable jibe at pakistan stated that it should abandon its ambitions to claim kashmir. in her speech she reiterated that jammu and kashmir was an integral part of india and will continue to remain so.in her comments condemning acts of terrorism across the world, she stated that nations which are haven to terrorists should be isolated from the global community.here is her full speech:on behalf of india and on my own behalf, i congratulate you on your election as president of the 71st united nations general assembly. let me also take this opportunity to thank secretary general ban ki moon for his services to the united nations, history's largest peace movement.mr. president,a year has passed since i stood here at this hallowed podium to address the members of the international community. since then, much has changed in the world around us - some for the better, some for the worse and much which has been cause of great concern. there can be no better platform to ponder our actions and our achievements over the last year. we must remember that we will be defined not just by our actions, but equally, by our inaction.mr. president,a number of issues have been debated in this august assembly - from the necessity of global partnerships in sharing new vaccines and promoting access to affordable drugs to counter anti-microbial resistance, to the need for faster implementation of the sendai framework to mitigate the risk of natural disasters. from the challenge of ensuring well-ordered mobility of productive human resources, to the necessity of adequate consultations with troop contributing countries before framing mandates for un peacekeeping operations. but my time is limited. i would therefore, focus only on some of the most pressing issues facing the international community.also read : rattled pakistan shifts 17 terror camps in pok to army bases, civilian areas, say intel agencies mr. president,the true challenge of our time is to end the curse of harsh poverty that still lurks in so many corners of our world; to ensure that the fruits of growing prosperity reach those who need it most; to take forward the mission of gender equality and protect women where there is gender regression; and to ensure peace across boundaries, not least because there can be no prosperity without peace.i congratulate you for the priority you have given to the sustainable development goals (sdgs) by making them the theme for the 71st unga. i am happy that the 17 goals adopted by this assembly are matched by the development vision of my government, which is geared towards the achievement of these same objectives. under the swachh bharat mission (clean india campaign), more than 400,000 toilets have been constructed in schools. the beti bachao beti padhao (educate the girl child, save the girl child) programme has become a nation-wide mission. the make in india brand is receiving international acclaim. almost 250 million bank accounts have been opened for the poor under the jan dhan yojana, the largest financial inclusion programme the world has ever seen. digital india is transforming the country. under the skill india initiative, a number of programmes are underway to enable youth to reap the demographic dividend. these initiatives have added a new dimension to india's growth story, making it the fastest growing major economy in the world at a time of slow global growth.mr. president,we are all aware that 1/6th of humanity lives in india. therefore global success in realizing sdgs depends on the success achieved in india. we are committed to the wholehearted implementation of the agenda 2030 as a national effort. we have decided to dedicate one day in each session of our parliament for discussions only on sdgs. this will enable us to constantly monitor their progress and this will give us good results.also read: us welcomes india's decision to ratify the climate change protocol this year however, in a globalised world, national effort needs to be supplemented by international cooperation for the successful implementation of agenda 2030.mr. president,climate change is yet another serious challenge confronting us. there are enough resources on this planet to fulfil everyone's needs, but not enough to fulfil anyone's greed, for greed is limitless. in this context pm modi has championed a new concept - climate justice. if we respect nature, nature will respect and nurture us and future generations. but, if we exploit nature mindlessly, then we must be mindful that nature will unleash its fury upon us. in different parts of the world, we have already seen nature drift towards the unnatural - from torrential rain to excessive heat, from tsunamis to storms and cloudbursts.we must curb reckless consumption, and adopt lifestyles in harmony with nature. yoga, the storehouse of india's ancient wisdom, epitomises a sustainable lifestyle. let me record our gratitude for the unprecedented global response to the international day of yoga.in the paris agreement, the principle of 'common but differentiated responsibilities' and 'respective capabilities' has been acknowledged and accepted. this makes clear that while our responsibility is common, obligations are different. developed nations must discharge their responsibility in the search for the common good, with finance and technology transfer.india has launched an ambitious domestic effort to transform our energy mix to achieve 40% energy from non-fossil fuel sources by 2030. the massive investments required entail a predictable and stable environment towards which we are working actively. apart from this, our path-breaking initiative for an international solar alliance is intended to make efficient solar technology available for all.also read: don't reward or rebuke muslims; empower them, says pm modi at bjp conclave i assure this assembly that india will continue to play a leading role in combating climate change. we have decided to submit our instrument of ratification of the paris agreement on october 2, the birth anniversary of mahatma gandhi who epitomised a lifestyle with the smallest carbon footprint.mr. president,let me now turn to a subject of the most critical importance, one which deeply concerns every member of this assembly. this month we marked the 15th anniversary of the 9/11 terror attacks on this city. tragically, less than 15 days ago, another attempt at killing innocents was made through an act of terror in this same city. we, who have suffered in uri recently, understand the pain inflicted by the same forces. the world has been battling this scourge for long. however, despite the blood and tears of innocent victims, attacks this year alone in kabul and dhaka, istanbul and mogadishu, brussels and bangkok, paris, pathankot and uri as well as daily barbaric tragedies in syria and iraq, remind us that these malevolent forces are yet to be defeated.also read: modi calls islamabad sole exporter of terrorism; asks people of pakistan to fight against poverty we must acknowledge that terrorism is undoubtedly the biggest violation of human rights. it targets the innocent and kills indiscriminately. terrorism has gone way beyond affecting individuals or nations - it is a crime against humanity itself. but it is important to ask - who is behind this and who benefits from it? terrorists do not own banks or weapons factories, so let us ask the real question: who finances these terrorists, who arms them and provides sanctuaries? we heard similar questions being asked by afghanistan from this podium.mr. president,history proves that those who seed extremist ideologies, reap a bitter harvest. the germ of evil has grown into a hydra-headed monster, backed by technological sophistication that threatens the peace and harmony of our world. we will not be able to win against terrorism by making specious distinctions between your problems and mine, between terrorists who attack you and those who attack me. for we do not know who this frankenstein's monster will devour next.therefore if we want to defeat terrorism, there is only one way - that we unite across our differences, add steel to our resolve and inject urgency in our response. we need to forget our prejudices and join hands together to script an effective strategy against terror. this is not an impossible task provided we have the will. we can do it, we must do it. otherwise our future generations will forever hold us to account. and if any nation refuses to join this global strategy, then we must isolate it.also read: india today at loc: after uri attack, india quietly fortifies border positions, locals worry about escalation in our midst, there are nations that still speak the language of terrorism, that nurture it, peddle it, and export it. to shelter terrorists has become their calling card. we must identify these nations and hold them to account. these nations, in which un designated terrorists roam freely, lead processions and deliver their poisonous sermons of hate with impunity, are as culpable as the very terrorists they harbour. such countries should have no place in the comity of nations.mr. president,on 21st september, the prime minister of pakistan used this podium to make baseless allegations about human rights violations in my country. i can only say that those accusing others of human rights violations would do well to introspect and see what egregious abuses they are perpetrating in their own country, including in balochistan. the brutality against the baloch people represents the worst form of state oppression.mr. president,the prime minister of pakistan also said that india has placed pre-conditions for talks which are not acceptable to him. what pre-conditions? did we impose any pre-condition before extending an invitation for the oath-taking ceremony of our government? did we impose any pre-condition when i went to islamabad for the heart of asia conference and agreed to begin the comprehensive bilateral dialogue? did we impose any pre-condition when prime minister modi travelled from kabul to lahore? what pre-conditions? we took the initiative to resolve issues not on the basis of conditions, but on the basis of friendship! we have in fact attempted a paradigm of friendship in the last two years which is without precedent. we conveyed eid greetings to the prime minister of pakistan, wished success to his cricket team, extended good wishes for his health and well being. did all this come with pre-conditions attached?also read: rattled pakistan shifts 17 terror camps in pok to army bases, civilian areas, say intel agencies and what did we get in return? pathankot, bahadur ali, and uri. bahadur ali is a terrorist in our custody, whose confession is a living proof of pakistan's complicity in cross-border terror. but when confronted with such evidence, pakistan remains in denial. it persists in the belief that such attacks will enable it to obtain the territory it covets. my firm advice to pakistan is: abandon this dream. let me state unequivocally that jammu and kashmir is an integral part of india and will always remain so.mr. president,as i said at the very beginning, we will be judged by our action and equally by our inaction. what goals have we achieved and what objectives remain unfulfilled? i would like to highlight two such pending tasks of this assembly.the ccit was proposed by india in 1996. in 2016, despite the passage of two decades, we are yet to come to a conclusion. as a result, we are unable to develop a norm under which terrorists shall be prosecuted or extradited. therefore it is my appeal that this general assembly acts with fresh resolve and urgency to adopt this critical convention.also read: sacrifice of 18 soldiers will not go in vain, will isolate pakistan: modi in kozhikode just as we need a more contemporary approach to combating terrorism, we also need a less outdated security council that continues to reflect the world order of an earlier era. the vast majority of nations share the belief that the un should not remain frozen in 1945, just to serve the interests of a few. whether it is institutions or issues, we must come to terms with present day realities and the challenges that confront us. an expansion in the permanent and non-permanent membership of the council to reflect contemporary realities is therefore, an urgent necessity. we must move forward substantively towards text-based negotiations.mr. president,if both these long pending issues are addressed during your presidency, the success of this session will be ensured.the 21st century has begun in the shadow of turmoil, but we can turn this into a golden age in the history of civilization through united and concerted efforts. but what happens tomorrow will depend on what we do today.thank you.",0.06827568689813587,sushma swaraj unga : full text speech,"external affairs minister sushma swaraj leave stone

in delhi, patna, simrao, new york. one wonders he could have been a better sprinter.author chetan bhagat's bestselling novel seeks to make its leading duo, madhav jha (arjun kapoor) and riya somani (shraddha kapoor), one to root for. only instead of using #mfeo you are likely to use the roll your eyes emoji on innumerable occasions in mohit suri's listless and mawkish adaptation of the book. or just laugh out loud for all the wrong reasons such as when the digitally morphed face of bill gates imposed on a body appears on the screen. or you could repeatedly fist pump as two twenty-something girls seated next to the reviewer did, mocking the couple's proclivity to do so at every opportunity given. there is nothing fresh or entertaining about the college romance that brews in st steven's college in delhi (we're guessing riya and madhav wouldn't make the shortlist for the st stephen's). madhav comes from bihar and isn't well-versed with spoken english. riya is a member of a high society delhi who has a ""messed up family"". they may be poles apart socio-culturally and economically but sport is enough to bring them together. the tiring first half sees the duo going on a dilli darshan - metro, humayun's tomb, india gate, hauz khas to name a few - with riya turning singer to escape the blues and madhav being a toothy cheerleader. in delhi parlance he'd be called a chape. the spoilsport here apart from riya's privileged background is sailesh (vikrant massey), madhav's friend who spends the first half that he is not up her alley and that he is being taken for a ride.ballads touted as trump cards in suri's musical love sagas here only slacken the proceedings. madhav and riya are thick friends over the course of a song. it's a different matter that we never quite understand why riya ditches her friends to hang with madhav. suri's tropes are now getting dated and repetitive with repeated shots of shraddha kapoor jumping and smiling, all too reminiscent of her in aashiqui 2 and ek villain. another frequent collaborator screenwriter tushar hiranandani takes an all-too-familiar love story courtesy bhagat and fails to add any zing to the proceedings. instead we get half-baked commentary on beti padhao, beti bachao and the sanitation drive of the swachh bharat abhiyan which is conveniently forgotten by the good samaritan of a hero to explore the bar scene in the big apple. arjun kapoor's earnest and labored performance to pass off as the bihari collegian persistent to get a dillilwali girlfriend is limited to his broken english and accent. shraddha kapoor is convincing as the pyt who never has a bad hair day but far less as the young woman with ""issues"". the talented seema biswas is wasted as madhav's two-faced mom who is progressive enough to welcome girls into her school but conservative to judge a woman on the basis of her failed marriage. the endless, soppy romance gets the only workable twist in the too brief cameo in rhea chakraborty whose charming presence left us hoping that madhav would have a change of heart. but that would require deviating from bhagat's plans, impossible given he is also the film's producer.neither a compelling tearjerker nor an epic contemporary romance, half girlfriend is definitely not the film to celebrate modern love.movie review: half girlfriend also read: arjun-shraddha played basketball in 40 degrees, says half girlfriend cinematographeralso read: 5 absurd things from chetan bhagat's half girlfriend we hope don't reach the final cutwatch half girlfriend movie review: the good and the bad in this arjun-shraddha film",0.04606391293891295,half girlfriend review : arjun-shraddha ' soppy romance arduous watch,"director : mohit suri cast : arjun kapoor , shraddha kapoor , vikrant massey , seema biswas , rhea chakrabortyrating : ( 1/5 ) desi babu sees angrezi-speaking babe college. one-sided love first sight. impresses basketball skills wants friendship. girl , though fond , girlfriend terms conditions. runs away boy runs -

2017-05-29,"not nitish kumar, it is mamata banerjee who can give a tough fight to narendra modi in 2019","continuing with her attacks on the narendra modi government, mamata banerjee on monday slammed the centre for the new rule that bans sale of cattle for slaughter at animal markets.the west bengal chief minister called the centre's decision ""unconstitutional"" and asked the modi government to not interfere in the affairs of states.under the new rule, cattle buyers will now have to give an undertaking that the animalsare not for slaughter and the market committees will have to check thebuyers' credentials and keep records of sale.mamata's firm grip on west bengalwhile the bharatiya janata party (bjp), under amit shah, is keen on increasing its base in the east, it has realised that fighting mamata banerjee-led trinamool congress (tmc) in west bengal is not an easy task.mamata banerjee's tmc recently won four of the seven municipalities in the civic polls in west bengal, even snatching the gorkha janmukti morcha (gjm) bastion of mirik.the municipal polls, which were dubbed as a fight between a resurgent bjp and the tmc, saw the latter winning the seats convincingly and almost eliminating the competition.the win was particularly sweet for mamata banerjee as it came after bjp president amit shah visited west bengal to kick off an expansion drive of the party.there was further embarrassment for the bjp as the tribals who had lunched with amit shah during his visit to naxalbari joined the trinamool congress a week later in the presence of state tourism minister goutam deb. the bjp, however, alleged that the two bjp workers were abducted and forcibly made to join the tmc.reaching out to oppositionbeyond west bengal, mamata banerjee is nowadays often seen working with the opposition to corner the narendra modi government on various issues.she met congress president sonia gandhi twice in a span of weeks to discuss a consensus candidate for the upcoming presidential polls.mamata banerjee even met delhi chief minister arvind kejriwal who was reportedly not invited to the opposition meet at sonia gandhi's residence.at a time when bihar chief minister nitish kumar continues to send mixed signals on whose side he is--he skipped the lunch at sonia's residence only to meet prime minister modi in delhi the next day--mamata banerjee's anti-government posturing is constant.on issues such as demonetisation, mamata banerjee and the tmc have been aligned with the anti-government stand of the opposition. nitish kumar, on the other hand, lauded prime minister narendra modi for his demonetisation drive.mamata's more or less uniform stand on issues also possibly makes her a more agreeable partner to work with for other opposition parties such as the congress.taking on the modi governmentin the last three years, mamata banerjee has been one of the most vocal critics of the narendra modi government.besides verbally attacking the central government on issues such as demonetisation, the tmc supremo has often devised other ways of taking on the government.her government recently changed the names of several central government schemes in the state. so, prime minister narendra modi's pet project of swachh bharat mission (gramin) is now 'mission nirmal bangla', while pradhan mantri awas yojana-grameen is now 'banglar griha prakalpa'.the trinamool government's logic was that the state government has to now bear 40 per cent of the total cost of the implementation of the schemes as against 10 per cent earlier, and therefore, why should the central government get the credit.the decision was slammed by the bjp with one of its leaders chandra kumar bose comparing mamata banerjee to babur.at a time when opposition parties are trying to stitch a front to take on the narendra modi government, mamata banerjee could be the front-runner to lead such an alliance.also read:all what cm mamata said about pm modi's demonetisation

""lynching"" is said to be related with both or either of two people named charles lynch and william lynch, who lived in virginia in the united states. both were active in 1780s.lynching or lynch law is usually associated to them. it meant taking the law into one's own hands to punish someone - read black. it was vigilante justice meted out to black people.lynching became more common in the us during 19th century on both sides of the american civil war. before civil war, the black slaves, who attempted to escape from their masters, were lynched in several instances. some of the whites were also lynched for openly opposing slavery of blacksafter civil war when slavery was abolished and the blacks were given equal rights of citizenship and suffrage, the whites got angry in many states of the us over what they perceived as a big loss. hate groups like the ku klux klan and the knights of the white camelia cropped up and were allegedly involved in many instances of lynching.it is estimated that between 1880 and 1930, about 2,400 black men, women, and children were lynched in the united states. similar data is not available about lynching in india.is there any law to deal with lynching?lynching does not find mention in the indian penal code. no particular law has been passed to deal with lynching. it sounds strange for a county which is said to have possibly legislated the maximum number of laws and where lynching is believed to be predating recorded history.absence of a codified law to deal with mob violence or lynching makes it difficult to deliver justice in the cases of riots. however, section 223(a) of the code of criminal procedure, 1973 says that persons or a mob involved in the same offence in the same act can be tried together. but, this has not proved to have given enough legal teeth to justice delivery system.in the spate of lynching, some activists have set up the national campaign against mob-lynching for drafting a suitable law. the founders include jnu student-activists shehla rashid and kanhaiya kumar, dalit activist jignesh mevani and columnist tehseen poonawala.the drafting committee members include senior lawyer sanjay hegde, journalist-activist anil chamariya, delhi university professor apoorvanand, jnu professor nivedita menon, lawyer rebecca john and actor swara bhaskar.the drafting committee of the national campaign against mob-lynching is said to have plans to send its draft law to parliament and people in the government. rajiv mehrishi may well be on their list.also read | srinagar: dsp ayyub pandith beaten to death by mob outside jamia masjidman lynched, 3 thrashed over rumours of beef eating on delhi-ballabhgarh train routebjp worker shot dead in agra, locals lynch attacker, assaultalso watch | delhi: man lynched, 3 injured in train over rumours of beef consumption",-0.054182986325843466,"story lynching : kashmir haryana , hate crime thrives absence law","speaking backdrop two incidents mob lynching - dsp mohammad ayub pandith killed srinagar 15-year-old junaid murdered delhi-mathura train , union home secretary rajiv mehrishi said , "" ' think ( hate crime ) new india. feudal nature. today , shake conscience. cannot say lynching hate crimes something new. think hyped reported.

(tell your father to get a toilet built for you. we don't have the money for it.)"" manini tells her husband to pawn her wedding jewellery and get a toilet made for her. the toilet is constructed, they get a monetary reward under the swachh bharat abhiyan and live happily ever after.toilet: ek prem katha is a full-length feature film as opposed to the three-minute-long manini, and it is no surprise that its treatment of the subject is more in-depth. the trailer begins with akshay kumar's fixation on marriage, his relentless pursuit (*cough* stalking *cough*) of bhumi pednekar which blossoms into romance.they wed, and bhumi gets the shock of her life when she finds out that she is expected to defecate in the open. she demands a toilet and faces societal opposition. now, all manini got was a taunt that the family cannot afford to waste money on building a toilet, but no major opposition. however, in toilet: ek prem katha, it seems like the whole locality is vehemently opposed to the idea.further, akshay can be seen doing the rounds of government offices in the trailer, and realises that he not only has to fight society, but also corruption. none of these things find a mention in manini.praveen vyas had claimed that his plot was ""novel"" and the characters were ""unique."" however, both films are inspired by the real-life story of priyanka bharti, a 19-year-old bride who walked out of her marital home within two days due to the lack of a toilet. she returned only after an in-house toilet was constructed for her. the story received widespread media coverage, and priyanka even featured in an ad for unicef's nirmal bharat abhiyan alongside vidya balan.priyanka's actions inspired two other brides - jyoti of sant kabir nagar and priyanka rai of kushinagar. that's at least three women with the same story, hardly a ""novel"" story, as praveen vyas insisted.a simple google search with the filters set to results only till 2015 shows that the idea for toilet: ek prem katha originated much before manini was released. maybe praveen vyas should have checked, before filing a lawsuit.opinion: toilet ek prem katha and the charm of being akshay kumar in 2017opinion: will toilet ek prem katha play midas for pm modi's swachh bharat abhiyan? also watch: akshay kumar wins national award - how the actor became sabse bada khiladi ",0.003845856524427958,akshay kumar ' toilet ek prem katha copy short film manini ?,"akshay kumar bhumi pednekar ' toilet : ek prem katha making headlines film ' alleged copyright violation. filmmaker praveen vyas , whose short film manini ( 2016 ) revolves around subject , alleged "" novel "" plot lifted makers toilet : ek prem katha.the writers , sidharth garima , expressed frustration "" ridiculous "" allegations told hindustan times working script since 2013 , much release manini. likely file defamation case.but toilet : ek prem katha really inspired manini?first , let us discuss story manini. three-minute film begins conversation newlyweds , interrupted female relatives knocking door. take manini open field ask attend nature ' call sun rises. angry manini refuses defecate open.she gets support in-laws , tell , "" jaa ke apne baap se bol ki tumhare liye shauchalay banwa de. humare paas itne rupaye nahi hai.

2017-10-02,"building toilets only half the story, ensuring usage more important: aroon purie at safaigiri 2017","aroon purie, chairman and editor-in-chief of india today group, delivered the keynote address at the third edition of the safaigiri awards today.here is the full text of his speech: honourable vice president, ladies and gentlemen, welcome.throughout the day, we've had our safaigiri champions with inspiring stories of their contribution to the swachh bharat campaign. it's been a heart warming and learning experience for me.when prime minister narendra modi invited me to be a swachhata ambassador in 2014, i didn't realise the journey would be so exhilarating and rewarding.i was your garden variety indian, complaining about widespread dirt and uncommon filth and doing very little about it. i am ashamed to say that we had all gone immune and blind to the indignity of open defecation till prime minister modi in his first independence day speech brought it front and centre of the national discourse.he united all of us to be part of a people's movement. it stirred our consciences and kick-started our activities. it set the india today group on a mission to be part of this movement and make a difference.we decided to do what the media does best. influence minds and if done right, inspire people. three years ago, we introduced the safaigiri summit and awards, disseminated the importance of changing mindsets. the purpose was to recognise the good work done by people in swachhta and inspire others. we have realised, as has the government, that building toilets is only half the story. ensuring their usage is more important. the numbers have been encouraging. government data shows that open defecation has been reduced by almost 30 per cent, from 69 per cent to 38 per cent in three years.this is great progress but not enough. other countries have achieved higher goals, most notably bangladesh which went from 42 per cent open defecation in 2003 to almost none now, and ethiopia which reduced open defecation from 92 per cent in 1990 to 29 per cent in 2015. we've also added this year awards for the best asian government cleanliness initiative and best global cleanliness initiative to show how it can be done.but the challenges in india are far more complex. india is culturally diverse, it is more densely populated, there is scarcity of water, and there is stigma associated with emptying pits which even mahatma gandhi could not help us erase.above all, there is a gender imbalance in the communication. women who are the biggest sufferers from the lack of toilets, can be the most effective agents of change.this is why we introduced a new segment in our awards ceremony this year--that of swachhata hi seva champions. all women, who have transformed their households or communities in some way or the other. today we saw on stage these marvellous women who have dedicated their lives to swachhata.lack of sanitation is a silent killer which stunts growth of children (diarrhoea itself kills 100,000 children every year) and causes loss of dignity and security to women. it is estimated that it causes a loss of six per cent to the gdp every year.the possibilities of what india can do if there is no open defecation are tremendous. some of this change is beginning to be seen in public policy. waste is no longer seen as a burden but as a resource, a business opportunity. visual cleanliness is being encouraged with the village swachhata index allowing self rating with an increasingly extensive questionnaire.technology is being deployed effectively to monitor and verify change, through government apps made in collaboration with enterprising ngos. more than that, corporations and foundations are joining together in making it a genuine people's movement. we ourselves have built nearly 2,000 toilets.i liked what the vadodara municipal commissioner, vinod rao, said earlier today. he and his team have done a marvellous job in cleaning vadodara and is one of our awardees. he said: ""cleaning a city is like running a race without a finishing line."" he added, ""there were three most important things to remember for a campaign to be a success: public awareness, public awareness and public awareness."" let's give him a round of applause.while we all continue our campaign for swachhta, we have to, i believe, remember a few things:#1. swachhata has to be sustainablebuilding toilets is not enough. we need to ensure these toilets are used and not just for now, but always. sanitation is a habit not a fad.#2. swachhata has to be collectivea country as vast as india can never be clean if swachhata is an individual activity. india is renowned for what john kenneth galbraith called private affluence and public squalor. #3. swachhata has to be measurableone of the great management gurus said: ""if you want to change something, start by measuring it first."" whether it is the status of open defecation in the country or the visual cleanliness of a village or city, there has to be an index that updates it. otherwise lapsing into bad habits is all too easy. #4. everyone is a swachhagrahithe government has started a volunteer scheme where 2.5 lakh volunteers or trained motivators now go from village to village talking about cleanliness. it's something we can all practise in our lives.#5. swachhata is a skillin an era of declining skills, we must remember the mission to clean india can become a big job creator--for instance india has a huge shortage of trained masons for twin pit toilets, the most environmentally friendly technology for rural areas. #6. swachhata can also be a friendly competitionall of us should compete to be cleaner than the other, whether it is at the level of village, district or city. if this means many more entries for safaigiri awards next year, that will be most welcome. #7. swachhata is forevereven if we manage to achieve the goal of making india free of open defecation by 2019, the fight against dirt must continue. prime minister in his three years has done many major reforms but i believe his greatest legacy will be his swachh bharat abhiyan. for that, the nation should be grateful to him.we are honoured that he's sent us a message for this occasion. he's also tweeted his 35 million followers his congratulations to the safaigiri awardees.despite declining gdp numbers, simmering social resentments and angry young people on campuses, our swachhata champions give me great hope for india's future. as i hope they give you.it is now my privilege to introduce our honourable vice president, shri venkaiah naidu.honouring these champions is a man who knows the often harsh realities of india. india's new vice president grew up in a village, a farmer's son in nellore district in andhra pradesh.he was here last year as minister for urban development, which was one of the nodal ministries in the swachh bharat mission, and knows the challenges to sanitation in india's cities and towns. but like prime minister modi, he has an optimistic nature, and knows that if much has to be done, a lot has also been achieved.his own life is a study in possibilities--from a young student leader whose job was to put up posters of stalwarts atal bihari vajpayee and lal krishna advani, to president of the bjp, to minister with multiple and equally important portfolios, mr vice president has always been invaluable to his leadership. when he was elevated to this position, he had said: there is no my party or your party. now i am a non party man.that is the spirit with which the mission to clean india has to be viewed. as one of our winners has said: we are the problem and we are the solution. i am sure mr vice president, you will agree with that. also, despite your elevation, i hope, your witticisms for which you are famous for have stayed with you. welcome.watch: women can be most effective agents of change, says aroon purie at

2018-06-04,world environment day: let's beat plastic pollution with all our might,"in 2014, india made a resolution to achieve a clean country under the swachh bharat abhiyan. we've been taught how dirty surroundings lead to diseases and other complications. many people participated in the programme and we do have cleaner platforms and streets, if not everywhere then at least in some places.but the question is, does it really help to just clean your surroundings? what happens to the plastic you use and put it in the dustbin?today is world environment day and the theme this year is beat plastic pollution.the production of plastic has outpaced almost every other material. most of the plastic we use can only be used once and needs to be thrown away. plastic cover on vegetable at super market (getty images)we clean our house and get rid of all the waste, thinking we are working towards clean india mission but cleaning is just a visible removal of the waste of your house and sending it to some other place.we have managed to produce over 9 billion tons of plastic till now, of which only 9 per cent could be recycled. the rest ends up in landfills, dumps or the environment.why plastic is so bad (getty images)most plastics do not biodegrade, they break down into smaller fragments known as microplastics. these microplastics contaminate the ocean, soil and the air. every plastic bottle we throw away is poison we are making not only for the human race but also for other species.at present, even our salt and water contain plastic particles. and there is no end to the ways all the plastic waste whether on the dumping ground or in the ocean can harm us and the environment.cut plastic use: if you cannot reuse it, refuse itfor our health, for our earth and for our future generation, let us all agree on one thing: if you cannot re-use it, refuse it. cut the use of plastic.however, it is not possible to remove all the plastic from society but alternatives can be adopted to lessen their use. our government has tried banning the use of plastic bags but it has not been successful even once.incident of my hometownin my hometown, khairabad, in up, plastic bags were banned with immediate effect last year and all the shop owners stopped using them. it was difficult at first; we used to forgot to take grocery bags with us to the shops but eventually, we got used to it.but when we finally came in line, the administration kind of loosened up with the laws and plastic bags once again made their way back into our lives. and we were simply not aware enough to keep them out of our lives.how to cut the plasticthe government has tried banning the plastic bags again and again but the local manufacturing units and cheap prices ruin the effort. the government also tried imposing a penalty on the use of plastic bags but carry bags are not the only plastic we use.each month, we use lots of plastic in the form of water bottles or soft drink bottlesalmost every product we buy comes wrapped in plastic be it food or toiletrieseven supermarkets tend to wrap vegetables in plasticthings we buy online always come wrapped in plastic, be it a simple t-shirt or an electronic item. and home delivery is a rising trend now rubbish washed up on a beach. (getty images)the efforts of the government alone cannot reduce the use of plastic but we need to step up and take the challenge. a random penalty for the use of plastic bag is not going to stop its use but our conviction can.so we are not going to talk about the steps government needs to take like the categorisation of household waste but instead, we will only talk about the measures we as responsible citizens - should follow. water pollution because of plastic (getty images)next time, you go shopping, bring your own shopping bagput pressure on the food suppliers to use non-plastic packagingcarry your own water bottles and avoid buying packaged drinking water you can fill up the bottle from drinking water dispensersrefuse plastic cutlery when you take away food from restaurant or eaterydon't use plastic straws invest in a steel one or opt for cardboard strawsdon't use disposable plastic cups for tea/coffeedon't use plastic glass for juice. you can make juice at homebuy grocery items like flour and rice in bulk which come in jute bags to avoid the use of plasticbring your own container to buy loose grainsthese are only a few measures and the easy ones. people in other countries go to extreme levels to cut the use of plastic and become zero waste producers.also, if you have some other suggestions to cut the use of plastic, feel free to comment.and remember: if you cannot reuse it, refuse it.interested in general knowledge and current affairs? click here to stay informed and know what is happening around the world with our g.k. and current affairs section.to get more updates on current affairs, send in your query by mail to education.intoday@gmail.com",0.05565894678797904,world environment day : let ' beat plastic pollution might,"2014 , india made resolution achieve clean country swachh bharat abhiyan.

2018-10-07,"unicef praises pm modi for 'investing' political time in health, sanitation issues","by murtuza merchant mumbai, oct 7 (pti) unicef executive director henrietta fore has praised prime minister narendra modi for investing the ""political time and efforts"" in issues like health and sanitation. she said people start looking around at other things that need improvement when they begin to feel that their community is doing better. ""if you invest a dollar in sanitation solutions, the benefit will be four dollars in terms of health cost prevention, the (reduction in) number of visits you go to a doctor and in the medicines that you don't have to buy,"" fore told pti in an interview here. she was in the city to attend an event organised jointly by the unicef (united nations children's fund) and the national stock exchange (nse) friday. ""the prime minister invested political time and effort and what it meant was people began picking up that story. they want to do it for mahatma gandhi, for their country and they felt pride in it,"" she said in an apparent reference to ""swacch bharat"" mission. the flagship cleanliness drive, launched by the prime minister in 2014, aims to clean up the streets, roads and infrastructure of india's cities, towns, and rural areas. modi had said the sanitation coverage in the country has increased from 38 per cent to nearly 80 per cent and asserted that the 'swachh bharat mission' is playing a central role in creating a healthy india. modi and french president emmanuel macron were recently awarded the un's ""champions of the earth"" award for their pioneering work in championing the international solar alliance and promoting new areas of cooperation on environmental action. fore said, ""it (contribution to sanitation) doesn't have an economic return but when you begin to feel that your community is doing better, it makes you look around at the other things that need improvement"". ""it makes one think that does he have clean water and the solutions for open defecation for all animals in their village, is there a community healthcare clinic, is there enough nutrition for children; not just latrines, what about lighted pathways for all of the girls going to schools. it makes you improve your world,"" said the executive director. when asked about unicef's view on the child mortality rate (cmr) in india during the past decade, fore said it has shown improvement. ""since 1990s, when the numbers first began, there was a significant reduction in child mortality. sanitation, clean india should bring numbers down further. what we don't know yet is how much further they should bring them down. but it's an exciting journey for india and we really are on the right path,"" she said. fore feels that health is one of the challenges an emerging country like india could face in its journey towards a clean nation. ""clean water brings health benefits in a way that many other national strategies cannot,"" she said. fore said learning new skills is another challenge for a developing nation because many new industries are expected to flourish. ""(another challenge is to) how to get more women in labour force...the number of women in formal labour force is going down. if only a third of total women in india are in formal employment, it is not high enough to get all of ideas and energy of india,"" she said. the executive director acknowledged malnutrition as another challenge. ""this is because if a young child does not get proper nutrition before the age of three and first thousand days, it could affect the development of her brain as well as body. it means they cannot be productive, it means the economy will not be doing so well,"" she said, adding employment gets affected ultimately because malnutrition denies children an opportunity. she further said public policy makes a difference in a developing economy. ""so if you begin to look at all these areas a country can look at, india says it wants to skill it youth and (wants to) have a digital future. that vision for future india is what unicef and generation unlimited is focused on,"" she said. fore said if india gets it right for the age group of 10 and 24, it would mean that the country fares well in the decades to come. ""if this young population is not caught between those ages, then it is next to impossible for a country to do well. india's outreach for these young people will be the tipping point for the developing country,"" she said. when asked if the unicef sees the flagship programmes of the prime minister sustaining in future, fore said, ""people want areas like nutrition, health, education, sanitation, water protection etc. irrespective of political climate or which party is in power. ""so it's up to every community, every household to put a value in it. i believe in terms of sanitation that where there is a room there is a toilet (and) most families would want to keep that. the challenge is to maintain and professionalise it so that people learn to maintain and service it,"" she said. ""it's going to be on each one of us to keep those programmes going that we think benefit the health, education and nutrition in our communities,"" she said. united nations children's fund (unicef) is a united nations agency headquartered in new york city that provides humanitarian and developmental assistance to children and mothers in developing countries. it is a member of the united nations development group. pti mm nsk aar",0.09697173599347512,"unicef praises pm modi ' investing ' political time health , sanitation issues","murtuza merchant mumbai , oct 7 ( pti ) unicef executive director henrietta fore praised prime minister narendra modi investing "" political time efforts "" issues like health sanitation. said people start looking around things need improvement begin feel community better.
