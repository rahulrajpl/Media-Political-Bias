(hindi version is attached):address by the president of india to parliament on june 9, 2014honourable members i am delighted to address this first session of both houses of parliament after the elections to the 16th lok sabha. let me begin by extending warm greetings to my fellow citizens, who participated in large numbers in the recently concluded lok sabha elections. we should never forget that we are here because of them. serving them should be our first priority. i also felicitate the members of the new lok sabha. you have successfully obtained the mandate from the electorate and now you represent their hopes, aspirations and dreams. i extend a warm welcome to all of you and hope that the sessions ahead with heavy legislative agenda will be productive and useful.2. it is a matter of great satisfaction that the recent general elections were smooth and largely peaceful. i would like to congratulate the election commission of india and the official machinery for conducting these elections successfully. the unprecedented interest shown by the people of india in the elections is a sign of progressive deepening of our vibrant democracy. before i dwell upon the tasks ahead of us, i would like to express my solidarity with the families of all those who lost their lives during the election process.3. i congratulate the new speaker of the lok sabha on her unanimous election to this august office. by successively electing women speakers, the lok sabha has re-affirmed our age-old belief in the importance of women in our society.honourable members4. this has been an election of hope. it marks a turning point in the evolution of our democratic polity. the surge in aspirations and the belief that these could be realized through democratic processes, has been amply reflected in the record 66.4% participation by voters, and a clear verdict in favour of a single political party after a gap of nearly 30 years. the electorate transcended the boundaries of caste, creed, region and religion to come together and vote decisively in favour of development through good governance.5. the country needed a strong and stable government that could provide effective leadership. in my republic day speech earlier this year, i had hoped for 2014 to be a year of healing after the fractured and contentious politics of the previous years. standing here today, i applaud the wisdom of my fellow citizens for having voted for stability, honesty and development in a resurgent india in which corruption will have no place. they have voted for a united, strong, and modern india - ""ek bharat - shreshtha bharat"". my government will work to fulfill these aspirations; with the involvement of all the 125 crore people of this great country.6. my government is committed to nurturing the right environment for actualizing this mandate of the people. for this, it pledges itself to the principle of 'sabka saath, sabka vikas'; which can be fulfilled only through your active participation. we will work together to re-establish the credibility of the institutions of democracy. my government will function on the mantra of 'minimum government, maximum governance'. in all our actions, we will be guided by the core values of our great civilization.honourable members7. my government is dedicated to the poor. poverty has no religion, hunger has no creed, and despair has no geography. the greatest challenge before us is to end the curse of poverty in india. my government will not be satisfied with mere ""poverty alleviation""; and commits itself to the goal of ""poverty elimination"". with a firm belief that the first claim on development belongs to the poor; the government will focus its attention on those who need the basic necessities of life most urgently. it will take necessary steps to provide security in its entirety to all citizens; through empathy, support and empowerment.8.containing food inflation will be the topmost priority for my government. there would be an emphasis on improving the supply side of various agro and agro-based products. my government will take effective steps to prevent hoarding and black marketing. it will reform the public distribution system, incorporating best practices from the states. my government is alert about the possibility of a subnormal monsoon this year and contingency plans are being prepared.9. despite more than two-thirds of our people living in rural areas; we have not been able to provide adequate public amenities and livelihood opportunities to them. my government is committed to improving the quality of life in our villages, through empowered panchayati raj institutions. a substantial part of investment will focus on creating community assets and improving basic infrastructure such as roads, shelter, power and drinking water. my government will strive to end the rural-urban divide guided by the idea of rurban; providing urban amenities to rural areas while preserving the ethos of the villages.10. agriculture is the source of livelihood for majority of our people. in the recent past, our farmers have been under severe stress with hopelessness driving some of them to suicides. my government is committed to reversing this unfortunate trend. it will increase investment in agriculture, both public and private, especially in agri-infrastructure. steps will be taken to convert farming into a profitable venture through scientific practices and agro-technology. my government will address issues pertaining to pricing and procurement of agricultural produce, crop insurance and post-harvest management. productivity of animal husbandry will be increased. my government will incentivize the setting up of food processing industries. existing cooperative sector laws will be reviewed to remove anomalies and lacunae. my government will adopt a national land use policy which will facilitate scientific identification of non-cultivable land and its strategic development.11. each drop of water is precious. my government is committed to giving high priority to water security. it will complete the long pending irrigation projects on priority and launch the 'pradhan mantri krishi sinchayee yojana' with the motto of 'har khet ko paani'. there is a need for seriously considering all options including linking of rivers, where feasible; for ensuring optimal use of our water resources to prevent the recurrence of floods and drought. by harnessing rain water through 'jal sanchay' and 'jal sinchan', we will nurture water conservation and ground water recharge. micro irrigation will be popularised to ensure 'per drop-more crop'.honourable members12. india is the world's oldest civilization. today it is also a country with the largest population of the youth. we must equip and nurture our youth with the right kind of education, skill-set and opportunity to reap this demographic dividend. my government will strive to transition from youth development to youth-led development. it will set up massive open online courses and virtual classrooms. it will formulate a national education policy aimed at meeting the challenges posed by lack of quality, research and innovation in our educational institutions. we will set up iits and iims in every state. in order to empower school teachers and students, a national e-library will be established. with the motto of ""har haath ko hunar"", my government will strive to break the barriers between formal education and skill development, and put in place a mechanism to give academic equivalence to vocational qualifications. with the goal of skilled india, my government will also launch a national multi-skill mission.13. the children and youth of the country need avenues of recreation that develop them constructively and keep them fit. my government will launch a 'national sports talent search system'. it will facilitate development and promotion of indian sports, particularly rural sports. sports will be popularised by making it an integral part of the school curriculum and providing educational incentives.14. our country needs a holistic health care system that is universally accessible, affordable and effective. to achieve this objective, my government will formulate a new health policy and roll out a national health assurance mission. it will promote yoga and ayush. to address the shortfall of health care professionals, health education and training will be transformed. aiims like institutes will be established in every state in a phased manner.15. we must not tolerate the indignity of homes without toilets and public spaces littered with garbage. for ensuring hygiene, waste management and sanitation across the nation a ""swachh bharat mission"" will be launched. this will be our tribute to mahatma gandhi on his 150th birth anniversary to be celebrated in the year 2019.16. keeping in mind welfare of the people belonging to the scheduled castes, scheduled tribes, other backward classes and the weaker sections of our society; my government will take steps to create an enabling eco-system of equal opportunity in education, health and livelihood. my government is committed to see that those belonging to the scheduled castes and other backward classes are able to avail emerging opportunities. for the scheduled tribes, my government will launch a dedicated ""van bandhu kalyan yojana"". electrification of tribal hamlets and connecting them with all-weather roads will be a priority area.17. it is unfortunate that even after several decades of independence, sections of minority communities continue to suffer from poverty, as benefits of government schemes do not reach them. my government is committed to making all minorities equal partners in india's progress. the government will especially strengthen measures to spread modern and technical education among minority communities and a national madarsa modernization programme will be initiated.18. the welfare and rehabilitation of specially-abled people is integral to my government's vision of a caring society. it will take steps to provide dignity of life to them by facilitating their participation in all walks of life. steps will be taken to identify their special needs and to provide institutional care to them.19. my government recognizes the important role our women play in the development of our society and growth of the nation. it is committed to providing 33 per cent reservation to them in the parliament and state legislative assemblies. with a commitment of ""beti bachao-beti padhao"", my government will launch a mass campaign for saving the girl child and enabling her education. it will structure a comprehensive scheme, incorporating best practices from states in this regard. in the recent past, the country has witnessed some grue some incidents of violence against women. the government will have a policy of zero tolerance for violence against women, and will strengthen the criminal justice system for its effective implementation.honourable members20. india is a federal polity. but, over the years, the federal spirit has been diluted. the states and the centre should function as an organic team india. in order to actively engage with the states on national issues, my government will reinvigorate fora like the national development council and the inter-state council. the centre will be an enabler in the rapid progress of states through cooperative federalism. state-specific development models will be developed taking into account the special needs and unique problems of coastal, hilly and desert areas. highest priority will be accorded to bring eastern region of the country on par with western region in terms of physical and social infrastructure. my government is committed to addressing the issues relating to development of andhra pradesh and telangana. the government will lay special emphasis on improving the intra-region connectivity and border infrastructure in the northeast as well as in jammu & kashmir. the issue of infiltration and illegal immigrants in the northeast region will be tackled on priority and all pending fencing work along the northeast border will be completed. special efforts will be made to ensure that kashmiri pandits return to the land of their ancestors with full dignity, security and assured livelihood.21. my government is committed to providing a clean and efficient administration focussed on delivery. the institution of lok pal is important to curb corruption and my government will endeavour to formulate rules in conformity with the act. my government will take steps to build the confidence and morale of our bureaucracy; enabling it with the freedom to work, and welcoming innovative ideas. the government will stress on putting in place transparent systems and timebound delivery of government services. government systems and processes will be revisited to make them citizen friendly, corruption free and accountable. efforts will be made to eliminate obsolete laws, regulations, administrative structures and practices. rationalization and convergence among ministries, departments and other arms of the government will be ensured to have focussed delivery. digitization of government records will be done for improving accessibility.22. e-governance brings empowerment, equity and efficiency. it has the power to transform peoples' lives. the backbone of my government's new ways of working will be a digital india. it will be used to drive re-engineering of government processes to improve service delivery and programme implementation. we will strive to provide wi-fi zones in critical public areas in the next five years. my government will rollout broad band highway to reach every village and make all schools e-enabled in a phased manner. technology will be used to prepare our children for a knowledge society. the national e-governance plan will be expanded to cover every government office from the centre to the panchayat; to provide a wide variety of services to citizens. emerging technologies like social media will be used as a tool for; participative governance, directly engaging the people in policy making and administration.23. my government is determined to rid the country of the scourge of corruption and the menace of black money. as a first step in this direction, the government has already constituted a sit to unearth black money stashed abroad. this will be followed up vigorously by proactively engaging with foreign governments.24. keeping in mind that justice delayed is justice denied, my government will adopt a multi-pronged approach to address the problem of high pendency of cases in our judicial system. it will progressively modernize the courts to improve their operational efficiency, and start reform of the criminal justice system to make dispensation of justice simpler, quicker and more effective. it will initiate a mission mode project for filling vacancies in the judiciary and for doubling the number of courts and judges in the subordinate judiciary in a phased manner. the government will give special emphasis to the development of alternate dispute resolution mechanisms.honourable members25. on the economic front, we are passing through an extremely difficult phase. for two consecutive years, our gdp growth has been less than 5 per cent. tax collection has declined. inflation continues to be at an unacceptable level. thus, putting the indian economy back on track is paramount for my government. we will work together to usher our economy into a high growth path, rein in inflation, reignite the investment cycle, accelerate job creation and restore the confidence of the domestic as well as international community in our economy.26. my government will create a policy environment which is predictable, transparent and fair. it will embark on rationalisation and simplification of the tax regime to make it non-adversarial and conducive to investment, enterprise and growth. my government will make every effort to introduce the gst while addressing the concerns of states. reforms will be undertaken to enhance the ease of doing business. my government will follow a policy of encouraging investments, including through fdi; which will be allowed in sectors that help create jobs and assets.27. for rapid creation of jobs in the manufacturing sector, the government will strategically promote labour-intensive manufacturing. employment opportunities will also be expanded by promoting tourism and agro-based industries. my government will transform employment exchanges into career centres - connecting our youth with job opportunities in a transparent and effective manner through the use of technology as well as through counselling and training. the government will strengthen the pension and health insurance safety nets for labour force of all categories and would provide them access to modern financial services.28. we need to transform ourselves into a globally competitive manufacturing hub powered by skill, scale and speed. to this end, the government will set up world class investment and industrial regions, particularly along the dedicated freight corridors and industrial corridors spanning the country. my government will encourage the domestic industry to innovate and collaborate internationally. it will strive to move towards a single-window system of clearances both at the centre and at the states through a hub-spoke model.29. to strengthen our share in global trade, procedures will be simplified and trade infrastructure strengthened so as to reduce transaction time and costs. the ssi and handicraft sectors will be encouraged by providing them enhanced technological, marketing and investment support. export potential of this sector will be encouraged. my government will make every effort to improve the working conditions of our weavers in particular. it will also set up a task force to review and revive our msme sector.honourable members30. lack of robust infrastructure is one of india's major impediments. the government will chalk out an ambitious infrastructure development programme to be implemented in the next 10 years. a fast-track, investment friendly and predictable ppp mechanism will be put in place. modernization and revamping of railways is on top of the infrastructure agenda. my government will launch a diamond quadrilateral project of high speed trains. the country will have a network of freight corridors with specialised agri-rail networks for perishable agricultural products. investment in railways will be increased using innovative financing methods. expansion of railways in hilly states and northeast region and modernization of rail safety systems will be prime focus areas. we will encourage r&d and high level local manufacturing for railway systems. a fast, time-bound and well monitored programme for execution of the national highways programme will be initiated, to overcome the stagnancy of the past few years. low cost airports will be developed to promote air connectivity to smaller towns. the government will evolve a model of port-led development. our long coastline will become the gateway for india's prosperity. my government will facilitate modernization of existing ports on one hand, and development of new world class ports on the other. stringing together the sagar mala project we will connect the ports with the hinterland through road and rail. inland and coastal waterways will be developed as major transport routes.31. my government will come out with a comprehensive national energy policy and focus on development of energy related infrastructure, human resource and technology. the aim of the government will be to substantially augment electricity generation capacity through judicious mix of conventional and non-conventional sources. it will expand the national solar mission and connect households and industries with gas-grids. reforms in the coal sector will be pursued with urgency for attracting private investment in a transparent manner. the international civil nuclear agreements will be operationalized and nuclear power projects for civilian purposes will be developed.32. my government is conscious of the fact that our urban infrastructure is under severe stress. soon, 50 per cent of our population would be residing in urban areas. taking urbanization as an opportunity rather than a challenge, the government will build 100 cities focussed on specialized domains and equipped with world class amenities. integrated infrastructure will be rolled out in model towns to focus on cleanliness and sanitation. by the time the nation completes 75 years of its independence, every family will have a pucca house with water connection, toilet facilities, 24x7 electricity supply and access.honourable members33. while putting the country on a high growth path, my government will keep sustainability at the core of our planning process. my government strongly believes that environmental conservation can go hand in hand with development. to achieve this, environment and forest clearance systems will be made more predictable, transparent and time-bound. simultaneously, an effective system will be developed for sound appraisal processes and strict compliance of clearance conditions, especially those relating to rehabilitation of displaced communities and regeneration of forests. cleaner fuels will be promoted to bring down pollution levels in our cities. the government will earnestly take up mitigation works to meet the challenges posed by climate change and will closely work with the global community in this regard. conservation of himalayan ecology will be a priority area for my government. a national mission on himalayas will be launched.34. in the recent past, serious concerns have been expressed regarding use of discretionary powers in allocation of our precious natural resources. the government will formulate clear and transparent policies on allocation of critical natural resources such as coal, minerals and spectrum.35. river ganga is a part of our rich cultural heritage, a symbol of faith and the lifeline for millions. however, ganga continues to remain polluted with many stretches of the river becoming dry in lean season. my government will take all necessary steps to ensure a perennial, clean and pristine ganga.36. our rich cultural heritage is the very foundation on which rests the unity of our diverse nation. indian languages are repositories of our rich literature, history, culture, art and other achievements. my government will launch a national mission ""e-bhasha"" that will develop digital vernacular content and disseminate our classic literature in different languages. my government will also provide the required resources for the maintenance and restoration of national heritage sites.37. india has a vast untapped potential for tourism which can play a special role in our socio-economic progress. the government will initiate a mission mode project to create 50 tourist circuits that are built around specific themes. with a view to encouraging pilgrimage tourism, a national mission for beautifying and improving the amenities and infrastructure at pilgrimage centres of all faiths will be launched.38. my government recognises the central role of science and technology in raising the quality of life. it will encourage and incentivise private sector investments, both domestic and foreign, in science and technology and in high-end research aimed at nurturing innovation. my government will build world class research centres in the fields of nanotechnology, material sciences, thorium technology, brain research, stem cells, etc. the government will also establish institutes of technology for rural development and a central university of himalayan studies.honourable members39. the government will maintain utmost vigil in the area of internal security. a policy of zero tolerance towards terrorism, extremism, riots and crime will be pursued. the states will be assisted for modernizing police infrastructure and equipment to tackle new forms of terrorism including narco terrorism and cyber threats. a national plan will be chalked out in consultation with the state governments to effectively curb incidents of communal violence and the challenges posed by left wing extremism. my government will take steps to equip the security forces with the latest technology and to improve their working conditions.40. my government will carry out reforms in defence procurement to increase efficiency and economy. it will encourage domestic industry, including the private sector; to have a larger share in design and production of defence equipment. we will introduce policies to strengthen technology transfer, including through liberalised fdi in defence production. with readily available skilled human resource, india can emerge as a global platform for defence manufacturing including software, which will strengthen our defence and spur industrial development as well as exports.41. the country is proud of its armed forces. they serve the nation with professionalism, dedication and valour; securing our nation and supporting relief and rescue operations in the wake of disasters and calamities. we will strengthen defence preparedness by modernising our armed forces and addressing the shortage of manpower on priority. recognising the importance of coastal security, my government will set up a national maritime authority.42. my government will do everything to repay the debt of our brave and selfless soldiers. it will appoint a veterans commission to address their grievances, so that they know that we don't stop caring for them when they retire from active service. the government will build a national war memorial to honour the gallantry of our soldiers. one rank, one pension scheme will be implemented.honourable members43.india's foreign policy, with its civilizational roots and heritage, is based on the principles of developing peaceful and friendly relations with all countries. we will pursue our international engagement based on enlightened national interest, combining the strength of our values with pragmatism, leading to a doctrine of mutually beneficial relationships. my government is committed to building a strong, self-reliant and self-confident india; regaining its rightful place in the comity of nations.44. my government sent a unique and bold signal to the south asian region and the world, by inviting for the first time in independent india, leaders of all south asian neighbours to the swearing-in ceremony of the new council of ministers on may 26. we are grateful to them for accepting the invitation at such a short notice. their participation, as also the gracious presence of the prime minister of mauritius; not only added sheen to the ceremony, but also represented a celebration of democracy in the region and convergence of our shared hopes and aspirations. this shows my government's commitment and determination to work towards building a peaceful, stable and economically inter-linked neighbourhood which is essential for the collective development and prosperity of the south asian region. we will further work together with south asian leaders to revitalise saarc as an effective instrument for regional cooperation and as a united voice on global issues.45. at the same time, we will never shy away from raising issues of concern to us at a bilateral level. we emphasize that the future of shared prosperity can only be built on the foundation of stability in the region, which requires sensitivity to security concerns and an end to export of terrorism to neighbours.46. my government will engage energetically with other neighbours in our region, including china, with whom we will work to further develop our strategic and cooperative partnership. we will strive to make progress in the many initiatives that are ongoing with japan, especially in the field of building modern infrastructure in our country. russia remains a privileged and strategic partner and my government will build further on the firm foundations of this relationship.47. india and the united states have made significant progress in developing strategic partnership over the years. my government will bring a renewed vigour to our engagement and intensify it in all areas, including trade, investment, science and technology, energy and education. india also values its broad-based cooperation with europe. the government will make concerted efforts to achieve progress in key areas with the european union as well as its leading members.48.to fully realize our softpower potential; there is a need to integrate it into our external interchange, with particular emphasis on our rich spiritual, cultural and philosophical heritage. the government will revive brand india riding on our strengths of 5t's: tradition, talent, tourism, trade and technology.49.across the world, we have a vibrant, talented and industrious indian diaspora that is a source of great pride for us. they have done pioneering work in diverse fields, held the highest public offices and have worked hard to support their localities and families in india. while they have contributed immensely to their adopted country, they also carry a little flame of india in their hearts that can light up the promise of change in our country. a hundred years ago, in 1915, india's greatest pravasi bharatiya, mahatma gandhi, returned home and transformed the nation's destiny. the next pravasi bharatiya diwas in january 2015 will thus be a special occasion. as we celebrate the centenary of gandhiji's return to india, we would also take steps that would deepen every pravasi bharatiya's connection with india and involve them in india's development.honourable members50. the people of india have given a clear mandate. they want to see a vibrant, dynamic and prosperous india. they want to see a resurgent india regaining the admiration and respect of the international community. brimming with hope and expectation, they want quick results. with three ds of democracy, demography and demand on our side, india is poised to actualize these aspirations. we must rise to the occasion to fulfill these great expectations. in 60 months from now, we should be able to say with confidence and pride that we have done it.jai

2014-07-10,"union budget 2014: jaitley gives tax gains, promises growth","finance minister arun jaitleyevery taxpayer will get tax relief of rs 5,000 in the union budget 2014-15 which was tabled in parliament by finance minister arun jaitley on thursday.among the big announcements was the increase of personal income tax limit from rs 2 lakh per annum to rs 2.5 lakh per annum. similarly, the limit for senior citizens was increased from rs 2.5 lakh to rs 3 lakh.the limit for investments under section 80c has been increased from rs 1 lakh to rs 1.5 lakh per annum. the deduction for housing loan interest was also revised from rs 1.5 lakh to rs 2 lakh per annum. full text of union budget 2014 | opposition slams union budget""i do not propose to make any change in the rate of surcharge either for the corporates or the individuals, hufs, firms etc,"" jaitley said in his speech.jaitley presented the budget with concerns over economic slowdown while promising bold corrective measures to unburden the poor from rising prices, revive investor confidence and cut excessive expenditure. ""people of india have voted decisively for change,"" jaitley said in what was the maiden budget for himself and prime minister narendra modi's government. ""steps i unveil in the budget aim at 7-8 per cent growth over the next three-four years, lower inflation, less fiscal deficit and a manageable current account deficit.""the minister said given the state of the economy today, high inflation, low growth and moderate rise in tax collections, the fiscal deficit target of 4.1 percent of india's gross domestic product set by his predecessor p. chidambaram was a ""daunting"" task.budget a ray of hope for poor and downtrodden: pm ""but i have decided to accept this target as a challenge,"" he said, adding he will seek to further bring down the fiscal deficit to 3.6 percent for the next fiscal and to 3 percent in the year after.he said the country cannot be made to suffer due to indecisiveness and populism and there was an urgent need to revive growth in manufacturing and infrastructure. ""we will also examine proposals for more autonomy to banks.""the finance minister said the possibility of a poor monsoon and the iraq crisis were key challenges with a bearing on both government finances and inflation. but he said the situation will be monitored closely to initiate immediate corrective steps. ""financial stability is the foundation of our recovery.""jaitley also promised early introduction of the pan-india goods and services tax, while assuring the domestic and global investment community of predictability in the tax regime to restore confidence about the country's prospects.the budget for current fiscal comes against the backdrop of the economic survey 2013-14, the annual report card on the state of the nation, which has termed inflation-control, job creation and pushing growth as the three main challenges, while calling for a fresh dose of reforms.expectations have been high from the budget after modi came to power with a landslide victory in the general elections, mainly on the promise of ushering in happy days for india's 1.2 billion people by creating more jobs, providing relief from price rise and reviving growth. budget 2014: jaitley says it's time to implement gstamong the various measures, jaitley announced a national multi-scale programme called skill india for providing training to youth and their employment, a national irrigation scheme and a smart city with an investment of over $1 billion as part of the larger plan for 100 such projects.he also announced many other schemes, such as one to help farmers realise right prices for their produce, at least four more institutions modelled on the all india institute of medical sciences (aiims), more money for people's welfare, many new airports on public-private partnership mode, a target of total sanitation in five years, greater autonomy for banks and higher investments by state-run enterprises.tax payers could save on their salaries and consumer goods like tvs, soap, footwear, processed food and computers will cost less as the rs.18-lakh crore (300-billion dollar) maiden budget of prime minister narendra modi's government promised to arrest price rise, boost investor mood, cut expenditure and restore india's growth to 7-8 percent in three years.during a 128-minute speech in the lok sabha by finance minister arun jaitley, with a five-minute break allowed by speaker sumitra mahajan upon his request due to momentary discomfort, a host of other proposals, both welfare schemes and reformist policy measures, were also unveiled that were aimed at a wide range of stakeholders -- from the girl child to senior citizens and overseas investors to the defence forces.at the same time, he acccepted as a challenge -- given the state of the flagging economy and rising prices -- the task to cut fiscal deficit, which indicates the extent to which the government overspends, to 4.1 percent of gdp for this fiscal, and further to 3.6 percent and 3 percent over the next two years.as high expectations ran high from the first budget of the modi government, after having been voted to power with a landslide victory mainly on promises of ""happy days"" for india's 1.2 billion people, jaitley also made it clear that putting the indian economy back on rails remained a daunting task needing more than one dose of corrective action.""the steps that i will announce in this budget are only the beginning of a journey towards a sustained growth of 7-8 percent or above within the next 3-4 years along with macro-economic stabilisation,"" the finance minister said.""therefore, it would not be wise to expect everything that can be done or must be done to be in the first budget presented within 45 days of the formation of this government,"" he added, setting the agenda for his speech.""we are going in the right direction to overcome challenges faced in the last decade,"" echoed modi while congratulating jaitley for the budget in which he provided a ""new ray of hope for the poor and downtrodden sections of society.""it was also in line with the ""government's vision to create a skilled and digital india,"" the prime minister said.we did not want to burden the common man: jaitley one of the most appealing proposals for the average tax payer was the hike in the exemption limit for individuals below 60 years to rs.250,000, and rs.300,000 for senior citizens. deductions under various heads such as investments in insurance, pension and house rent were also proposed to be raised by rs.50,000 to rs.150,000. interest on housing loans will also get a higher exemption. this apart, the duty-free baggage allowance for indians returning from abroad is also sought to be raised to rs.45,000 from rs.35,000.farmers will also stand to gain largely with jaitley's proposal for an integrated national market for agro-produce that will enable them to sell their crops directly to consumers and earn better prices. the subsidies to them, notably for soil nutrients, have also been enhanced.for industry, he assured that the pan-india goods and services tax will be introduced by the year-end and a fresh view taken on the direct tax code. retrospective tax, which creates liabilities not planned for and has been a matter of much concern for both domestic and overseas investors, will not be imposed at random. customs duties and excise rates were also rationalised for a host of sectors.union budget 2014-2015: smart cities and 24x7 power supply, says fmhe also sought to remove the perception of policy inaction and a freeze on economic reforms by hiking foreign equity in insurance and defence equipment to 49 percent from 26 percent, but left for later the much-promised overhaul of the subsidy regime after constituting an expenditure management commission and getting its recommendations.in his speech, jaitley also touched upon areas which few finance ministers in the past have done. such proposals included new schemes for conservation of sacred rivers, a sports university in manipur, welfare fund for migrants from kashmir, conservation of the himalayas, support for organic farming and a 24x7 channel for northeast and protecting the heritage of the andaman and nicobar islands.budget 2014-15: more iits, iims and aiimshe also promised at least four institutions modelled on the premier all india institute for medical sciences and indian institutes of management, and said the union government will look positively at every similar proposal forwarded by states.for the defence forces, he said the allocation was being raised by about 12 percent to rs.229,000 crore (nearly $40 billion), besides rs.5,000 crore ($830 million) for the modernisation of the 1.2 million-strong armed forces.other proposals, with enhanced monetary allocations, covered areas like education, urban renewal, transportation, malnutrition, minorities, infrastructure, food security, capital markets, banking, insurance, state-run enterprises, tourism, war and police memorials, interlinking of rivers, space, sports and bio-tech.as jaitley was unveiling his proposals, the stock markets swung both ways with a key index gaining more than 300 points at one point, then falling by some 250 points, before closing with an overall loss of around 70 points or 0.25 percent.industry, nevertheless, welcomed the proposals and said it laid down the requisite ground for a medium-term course correction to revive the indian economy.the confederation of indian industry (cii) complimented the finance minister ""on a pragmatic and extensive budget that lays out a medium term vision for the economy and meets industry expectations on growth and employment creation.""the federation of indian chambers of commerce and industry (ficci) also reacted in a similar vein and said the budget laid the ground for rejuvenating the economy. ""there has been a mix of both short-term and long-term measures, geared towards boosting the confidence of all key constituents.""",0.09388965770113307,"union budget 2014 : jaitley gives tax gains , promises growth","finance minister arun jaitleyevery taxpayer get tax relief rs 5,000 union budget 2014-15 tabled parliament finance minister arun jaitley thursday.among big announcements increase personal income tax limit rs 2 lakh per annum rs 2.5 lakh per annum. similarly , limit senior citizens increased rs 2.5 lakh rs 3 lakh.the limit investments section 80c increased rs 1 lakh rs 1.5 lakh per annum. deduction housing loan interest also revised rs 1.5 lakh rs 2 lakh per annum. full text union budget 2014 &#124; opposition slams union budget "" propose make change rate surcharge either corporates individuals , hufs , firms etc , "" jaitley said speech.jaitley presented budget concerns economic slowdown promising bold corrective measures unburden poor rising prices , revive investor confidence cut excessive expenditure.

does all that money i have paid as premium go down the drain?'at first look, it seems logical. and, that's one reason why most indians stay away from pure term insurance policies - something, that fi nancial experts say, is the most important chapter to secure the life of your loved ones - because these products do not give the policyholder any return on the amount paid as premium during his or her life time. but, consider this: for a 35-year-old, an annual premium of `10,830 for 25 years can buy a life cover of `1 crore, which can offer stability and meet the immediate needs of the family of the insured in the unfortunate event of his or her death. and, yes, if the person survives the 25-year term he or she loses the `2.7 lakh paid as premium.however, considering the uncertainties that life is all about, if we ask ourselves: 'what if something happens to me? will i be able to provide a fi nancially secured life for my dependents?' the question may, all of a sudden, come as a revelation to most of us, more so for those who form the base of the fi nancial pyramid. the bitter truth, in the indian context, however, is that the rich, in spite of a fi nancially setcured life, are more adept to taking to insurance, compared to the not-so-moneyed. and, this must change. fortunately for us, the government is also trying to raise awareness by offering various schemes and taking steps to bring it to your doorsteps.here, we will give you a sneak-peak into why it is the right time to take advantage of the activities in the insurance space by both the public and private players.click here to enlargeknow your products term plans: term insurance plans are pure protection plans which pay the sum assured on death of the policyholder. they are cheaper by 50-60 per cent when bought online. the rates, however, vary according to the policyholder's age and lifestyle habits. for example, smokers will have to pay a signifi cantly higher premium compared to that of a non-smoker.unit-linked insurance plans (ulips): ulips had caused a major fi nancial drain to investors during the 2000s leaving many feeling betrayed. however, after 2010, with a change in rules suggested by the regulator, the securities and exchange board of india, unit-linked plans have not only become more cost-effective, but provide you with the perfect platform to launch your life insurance needs.online distribution has sharply reduced acquisition and maintenance costs as well, so much so that there are some ulips whose costs are lower than that of mutual funds. for instance, if a 30-year-old man invests `50,000 every year in aviva's i-growth plan, the corpus will grow to around `13 lakh in 15 years, assuming an 8 per cent annualised rate of return. if the same amount is invested in a fi ve-star rated large- and mid-cap fund, the corpus would work out to around `11 lakh in 15 years (at 8 per cent), considering the higher expense ratio of mutual funds at 2.6 per cent, compared to 1.29 per cent for ulips.some low-cost ulips, according to policybazaar.com, an insurance comparison site, are aviva i-growth, bajaj allianz future gain, hdfc life click2invest, hdfc life progrowth plus and edelweiss tokio wealth accumulation. since charges are front-loaded, the benefi ts are more if you stay invested for a longer duration. also, loyalty additions are generally added after eight to 10 years.traditional plans: traditional policies give a sum assured and a guaranteed or vested bonus at maturity. such plans invest money in fi xed income instruments and are for people who do not want to take a lot of risk. several companies are also offering traditional plans online.click here to enlargedigital push in addition to the efforts of the life insurance companies, the central government, too, has been playing its part to sync the digital india programme with the evolving insurance space. it has launched three schemes, pradhan mantri suraksha bima yojana, pradhan mantri jeevan jyoti bima yojana (pmjjby) and atal pension yojana (apy), to take insurance to the doorstep of the most vulnerable sections of the society using the digital platform. private insurers have gone online to save costs and pass on the cost benefi ts to policyholders.india's massive subscriber base - of over 900 million mobile phone and 200 million internet users - has proved to be facilitator in this massive overhaul. experts say term plan is one of the fastest growing segments online in the life insurance industry and insurers need to leverage this opportunity. ""the digital platform plays a signifi cant role in our business. around 93 per cent of our new business applications are initiated using the online platform, 50 per cent renewal payments are made through the website or electronically, and 69 per cent service transactions are processed through website, sms or ivrs,"" says sandeep batra, executive director, icici prudential life.according to a report by boston consulting group and google india, insurance sales from online channels will grow 20 times by 2020. digitalisation has also improved offl ine sales. says batra: ""life insurance continues to be sold offl ine as it helps the customer to identify the appropriate insurance policy. the use of technology in the sales process has resulted in faster turnaround time."" almost 93 per cent of icici prudential's sales in 2014/15 happened using the digital platform. it has also helped in reducing the grievance ratio significantly.paperless insurance you can now maintain your policies in digital form as well. this is much more convenient than keeping physical copies for years. it alsogives you a platform to revise details electronically without any hassle. says s.v. ramanan, ceo, cams repository services: ""in the interest of the policyholder, it is important they take advantage of this free-of-cost initiative to convert their policies into electronic format. we have seen people who have been impacted with natural calamities, such as in j&k and assam, suffering, as the physical copies of their insurance policies were lost in the fl oods.""claims settlement we have also witnessed increased activity in the mobile application space where insurers are competing against each other to provide the consumer with an easy-to-use platform to connect even during the claims process.

2015-11-09,"modi, modi: one man, multiple roles","prime minister narendra modi has been a busy man -- visiting more than 20 countries and coming up with a never-ending stream of slogans to usher india on to the path of development and revival. his international roadshows in madison square garden in new york city in 2014 or this year in san jose were more befitting a rock star in full swagger than a mainstream politician, at least as conventionally understood.modi has mapped his moves well in the past year-and-a-half that he's been at the helm, he has evolved a proactive brand of diplomacy in which his role is part-visionary, part-politician, part-salesman and part purely thespian but always captivating. in doing so, modi has transformed the international narrative about india from one of a flailing power to that of a resurgent global force.modi believes that it is time a nation that houses one-sixth of humanity and is soon to be the world's third-largest economy, takes its rightful place in the sun. he also reckons that with the us on a gradual decline and the chinese shaky, india as the world's largest democracy has the opportunity to lead the world if it plays its cards well.as part of the quest for that status, modi is pulling out all stops for india to become a permanent member of the united nations security council (unsc), a proposal that had been languishing since 2005. the unsc is the diplomatic power club that currently has only five permanent members that also enjoy veto rights -- the us, britain, france, russia and china. now to gain entry into the unsc, india needs the support of two-thirds of the members of the 193-strong general assembly.prime minister narendra modi addresses the un general assembly.the move is not without its critics within the bjp, among them former external affairs minister yashwant sinha, who in an interview to india today tv charged the modi government with making unrealistic claims about getting into the unsc. sinha called the ""begging"" approach, adopted by the g4 countries (brazil, germany, india and japan) vying for unsc seats, ""demeaning"". ignoring the barbs, modi boldly convened a summit meeting of the leaders of g4 countries -- angela merkel of germany, shinzo abe of japan and dilma rousseff of brazil -- and got them to agree to push for expansion of the council in its 70th year, celebrations for which start this month. when modi met us president barack obama soon after -- his fifth meeting with the world's most powerful man since he took over as pm -- he reminded him of his commitment to back india's bid for a seat at the high table.it is not for nothing that obama called modi ""a man of action"" in their second meeting last year. unlike his predecessor dr manmohan singh, highly respected for his economic acumen and cautious approach, modi is not averse to taking risks and questions the need to remain neutral, even welcoming attachments. he is willing to act out-of-the-box as he did by agreeing to buy 36 rafale jets on his trip to france to break the logjam over the deal that had been hanging fire for two decades. he does not shy away from being hawkish and pursues india's national interest aggressively, as he did when he sent the army into myanmar territory in hot pursuit of north-east rebels. modi is ever-willing to be the 'first responder', as was seen when he rushed humanitarian assistance and disaster relief operations to nepal after the earthquake that struck it this may, as also yemen, destabilised by civil strife. and he has also recently shown willingness for india to shoulder greater global responsibilities by committing more troops to the un peacekeeping force.the result was a modi-krieg: in the five days that he was in the us, he addressed the un twice, met heads of states of 30 countries, both big and small, interacted with over 50 top us ceos heading companies with a net worth of over $4 trillion, broke bread with the iconic potentates of silicon valley, including a town hall interaction with facebook's founder mark zuckerberg, and generously spent time with large contingents of the diaspora in new york and california.policy wonks, however, are still divided as to whether modi has engineered a radical shift in india's approach or has largely continued the policies of his predecessor.us foreign policy expert stephen cohen thinks modi is ""all sizzle and no steak as he is yet to come up with a coherent policy to manage the contradictions or india's neighbours"". congressman and former external affairs minister salman khurshid concurs, adding, ""apart from the hype and hoopla, modi's foreign policy is a continuity of the upa efforts, much of which the bjp cussedly blocked when we were in power."" a senior european diplomat, however, feels, ""modi has brought focus and clarity to india's foreign policy -- he has a compass and it always points north for development.""modi's foreign policy initiatives are directly linked with his domestic goals, particularly economic. the prime minister is acutely aware that the ambitious programmes that he has launched, such as digital india, smart cities, make in india, skill india or start-up india, require massive infusion of capital, know-how and managerial skills to bring them to fruition rapidly. that would be possible only if foreign investors came in droves to pump the system up with money and bring in expertise.central to that premise of attracting investment is reform. much derided and much lampooned, reforms have been held up ever since they became an electoral liability. modi is an avid reforms person. his commitment to reforms is checked by the bjp's lack of numbers in the rajya sabha. if the party wins more states, it gains in the rajya sabha and will help it overcome the stiff challenge posed to it by the opposition which has a significant choke on the upper house, where long-awaited legislations, such as the land bill and the gst bill, continue to languish.the bjp pinned a lot of hope in winning the election to bihar assembly where it went as the major partner despite playing junior ally to the janata dal-united in their former coalition that came asunder in 2013. the bjp had won 91 seats when it contested with jd-u in 2010. but the elections of 2015 saw it reduced to 53. a victory in bihar would have enabled 16 members in the rajya sabha. the bjp has 48 seats in the rajya sabha compared to the 67 of the congress. but after the mahagathbandhan (grand alliance) of the jd-u, the rashtriya janata dal and the congress won a total 178 seats in the 243-member house.the bjp and the jd-u came apart when its leader and bihar's chief minister nitish kumar, a known modi baiter, walked out of the national democratic alliance the moment modi was chosen the bjp's prime ministerial candidate. with muslims being a key votebank, nitish did not want to be seen on the side of the man who is accused of turning a blind eye to the murder and mayhem that gripped gujarat over the last few days of february, lasting into march, in 2002. but from 2005 to 2013, nitish ruled bihar with the bjp.the modi wave, primed and kept captive, ever since he won the 2012 gujarat assembly election was waiting for the next target. in ahmedabad, modi made his victory speech in hindi, not gujarati, a fact not lost on political observers. bhakts on twitter could be counted on to silence any opposition to him. the party has campaigned as if there's no tomorrow. the campaign masters came up with abki baar modi sarkar and a sustained campaign that kept development a few pedestals higher than the core bjp issues -- ram mandir, article 370, the uniform civil code, cow protection etc.with the pursuit of development being more conducive to getting votes, the bjp in 2014 got 31 per cent of voteshare while the opposition congress fell by the wayside along with the rump of the secular, socialist challenge. that 31 per cent voteshare got the bjp 282 seats in a house of 543 on its own, freeing it of the compulsions of a pre-poll alliance. this was again ascribed to the revived modi wave that felled whatever came in its path. the power surge which got modi into 7, race course road, the official residence of the prime minister, also saw the bjp storm to power in three states -- maharashtra, haryana and jharkhand. the bihar-maharashtra similarities are many: the bjp played second fiddle in both states and in maharashtra, the party became top dog after dictating terms to its majority partner, the shiv sena. in haryana, the bjp had been a smaller entity in the bipolar land of the chautalas and the congress but gaining from the kinetic energy of the lok sabha campaign, the party pulled off a simple victory. the situation was the same in jharkhand, which was part of undivided bihar.since may 2014, the modi-led bjp has lost twice. the first defeat was in delhi, the bjp citadel, where it was laid low by the extra-censorious aam aadmi party despite the flagrant love jihad campaign. the second was bihar, where random comments on caste-based job reservation, minority-baiting and regionalism alienated the voter. this is what the bjp has had to guard against, just when everything's going well the fringe in the party unleashes its vitriol, damaging it.in bihar, modi, amit shah led from the front. bollywood stardust joined in, actor ajay devgn, who had dealt firmly with jungleraj in his films. a hint, a message. vote for us. on the other side was a former ally who spoke and delivered development but now dependent on the rashtriya janata dal, whose leader lalu prasad has been red-carded from contesting elections because of his conviction in the fodder scam cases. lalu is the great enemy of the bjp, a caste czar who commands a sizeable votebank of the under-privileged and the muslims.there is a reason why modi and his party raised the bihar pitch to a veritable war: the bjp wanted to undo the trauma it suffered on losing in the elections to the delhi legislative assembly, barely a few months after modi's march to parliament. the bjp left no stone unturned to ensure it appropriated bihar's anti-congress icon, jayaprakash narayan, nitish and lalu's political guru. the first phase of the bihar election fell close to both the birth and death anniversaries of jp, occasions milked by modi in attacking the duo for allying with the villain of the emergency, the congress.the amit shah-style aggression was manifest in bihar. in an unprecedented allotment from his otherwise packed schedule, prime minister modi committed to more than 40 rallies. he addressed almost a dozen, four a day, and even stayed back in patna for a night to address more the next day.nationally, modi has few adversaries as determined as nitish and lalu in bihar. the former not only severed his long-standing alliance with the bjp, but he's also been successful in pitching himself as bihar's vikaspurush (development man), a title otherwise reserved for modi. lalu, on the other hand, has been an old and bitter bjp foe, since the days of his audacious arrest of lk advani during the rath yatra in 1990s.the defeat in bihar can be a good wake-up call for the bjp to curtail its fringe that is ever ready with the divisive quote. and not to go in with the swag that backfired in bihar. there's some time to get rid of the bad habits of 2014 and 2015, an even busier 2016 beckons the bjp where west bengal, tamil nadu and kerala go for polls and uttar pradesh follows suit in 2017.",0.11023801447308912,"modi , modi : one man ,

2015-11-12,pm modi in uk: full text of pm modi's speech at british parliament,"lord speaker,mr. speaker,mr. prime minister i am delighted to be in london. even in this globalised world, london is still the standard for our times. the city has embraced the world's diversity and represents the finest in human achievements. and, i am truly honoured to speak in the british parliament.mr. speaker, thank you for opening the doors to us, here in this magnificent setting of the royal court. i know that the parliament is not in session. prime minister cameron looks relaxed and relieved.but, i want to remind you, mr. prime minister, that you owe me royalty for an election slogan. i know that you are hosting me at the chequers this evening. but, i also know that you will understand if i am fair to both sides of the floor. especially since british mps of indian origin are evenly balanced between the treasury and the opposition benches. so, i also extend my good wishes to the labour. indeed, since these are still early days after the election, my warm congratulations to the members of the house. and, greetings to the eminent leaders of britain and great friends of india present here today.so much of the modern history of india is linked to this building. so much history looms across our relationship. there are others who have spoken forcefully on the debts and dues of history. i will only say that many freedom fighters of india found their calling in the institutions of britain. and, many makers of modern india, including several of my distinguished predecessors, from jawaharlal nehru to dr. manmohan singh, passed through their doors.there are many things on which it is hard to tell anymore if they are british or indian: the jaguar or the scotland yard, for example. the brooke bond tea or my friend late lord ghulam nun's curry. and, our strongest debates are whether the lord's pitch swings unfairly or the wicket at eden gardens cracks too early. and, we love the bhangra rap from london just as you like the english novel from india.on the way to this event, prime minister cameron and i paid homage to mahatma gandhi outside the parliament. i was reminded of a question i was asked on a tour abroad. how is it that the statue of gandhi stands outside the british parliament? to that question, my answer is: the british are wise enough to recognise his greatness; indians are generous enough to share him; we are both fortunate enough to have been touched by his life and mission; and, we are both smart enough to use the strengths of our connected histories to power the future of our relationship.so, i stand here today, not as a visiting head of government, given the honour to speak in this temple of democracy. i am here as a representative of a fellow institution and a shared tradition.and, tomorrow, prime minister and i will be at the wembley. even in india, every young footballer wants to bend it like beckham. wembley will be a celebration of one-half-million threads of life that bind us; one and half million people - proud of their heritage in india; proud of their home in britain.it will be an expression of joy for all that we share: values, institutions, political system, sports, culture and art. and, it will be a recognition of our vibrant partnerships and a shared future.the united kingdom is the third largest investor in india behind singapore and mauritius. india is the third largest source of foreign direct investment projects in the united kingdom. indians invest more in britain than in the rest of european union combined. it is not because they want to save on interpretation costs, but because they find an environment that is welcoming and familiar.it takes an indian icon, tata, to run a british icon and become your nation's largest private sector employer.the uk remains a preferred destination for indian students. and, i am pleased that an indian company is taking a thousand british students to india to skill them in information technology.we are working together in the most advanced areas of science and technology. we are finding solutions to the enduring human problems of food and health security, and seeking answers to emerging challenges like climate change.our security agencies work together so that our children return home safe and our increasingly networked lives are not prey to the threats on cyber space.our armed forces exercise with each other, so that they can stand more strongly for the values we represent. this year alone, we have had three exercises together.and, in the international arena, your support has made it more possible for india to take her rightful place in global institutions and regimes. and, it has helped us both advance our common interests.mr. speaker,strong as our partnership is, for a relationship such as ours, we must set higher ambitions. we are two democracies; two strong economies; and, two innovative societies.we have the comfort of familiarity and the experience of a long partnership. britain's resurgence is impressive. its influence on the future of the global economy remains strong.and, mr. speaker, india is new bright spot of hope and opportunity for the world. it is not just the universal judgment of international institutions. it is not just the logic of numbers: a nation of 1.25 billion people with 800 million under the age of 35 years.this optimism comes from the energy and enterprise of our youth; eager for change and confident of achieving it. it is the result of bold and sustained measures to reform our laws, policies, institutions and processes.we are igniting the engines of our manufacturing sector; making our farms more productive and more resilient; making our services more innovative and efficient; moving with urgency on building global skills for our youth; creating a revolution in startup enterprises; and, building the next generation infrastructure that will have a light footprint on the earth.our momentum comes not just from the growth we pursue, but from the transformation that we seek in the quality of life for every citizen.much of india that we dream of still lies ahead of us: housing, power, water and sanitation for all; bank accounts and insurance for every citizen; connected and prosperous villages; and, smart and sustainable cities. these are goals with a definite date, not just a mirage of hope.and, inspired by gandhiji, the change has begun with us - the way the government works. there is transparency and accountability in governance. there is boldness and speed in decisions.federalism is no longer the fault line of centre-state relations, but the definition of a new partnership of team india. citizens now have the ease of trust, not the burden of proof and process. businesses find an environment that is open and easy to work in.in a nation connected by cell phones, digital india is transforming the interface between government and people.so, mr. speaker, with apologies to poet t.s. eliot, we won't let the shadow fall between the idea and reality.if you visit india, you will experience the wind of change.it is reflected in the surge of investments from around the world; in enhanced stability of our economy; in 190 million new bank accounts of hope and inclusion; in the increase in our growth to nearly 7.5% per year; and, in the sharp rise in our ranking on ease of doing business.and, the motto of sab ka saath, sab ka vikas, is our vision of a nation, in which every citizen belongs, participates and prospers.it is not just a call for economic inclusion. it is also a celebration of our diversity; the creed for social harmony; and, a commitment to individual liberties and rights.this is the timeless ethos of our culture; this is the basis of our constitution; and, this will be the foundation of our future.mr. speaker, members and friends,the progress of india is the destiny of one-sixth of humanity. and, it will also mean a world more confident of its prosperity; and, more secure about its future.it is also natural and inevitable that our economic relations will grow by leaps and bounds. we will form unbeatable partnerships, if we combine our unique strengths and the size and scale of opportunities in india.we will see more investment and trade. we will open new doors in the services sector. we will collaborate more - here and in india - in defence equipment and technology. we will work together on renewable and nuclear energy.we will explore the mysteries of science and harness the power of technology and innovation. we will realise the opportunities of the digital world. our youth will learn more from - and with - each other.but, a relationship as rich as this, with so much promise as ours, cannot be measured only in terms of our mutual prosperity.mr. speaker,ours is an age of multiple transitions in the world. we are yet to fully comprehend the future unfolding before us. as in the previous ages, it will be different from the world we know.so, in the uncharted waters of our uncertain times, we must together help steer a steady course for this world in the direction that mirrors the ideals we share.for, in that lies not just the success of our two nations, but also the promise of the world that we desire. we have the strength of our partnership and the membership of the united nations, the commonwealth and the g-20.we live in a world where instability in a distant region quickly reaches our doorsteps. we see this in the challenges of radicalization and refugees.the fault lines are shifting from the boundaries of nations into the web of our societies and the streets of our cities. and, terrorism and extremism are a global force that are larger than their changing names, groups, territories and targets.the world must speak in one voice and act in unison to combat this challenge of our times. we must adopt a comprehensive convention on international terrorism in the un without delay. there should be no distinction between terrorist groups or discrimination between nations. there should be a resolve to isolate those who harbour terrorists and willingness to stand with nations that will fight them honestly. and, we need a social movement against extremism in countries where it is most prevalent and, every effort to delink religion and terrorism.oceans remain vital for our prosperity. now, we have to also secure our cyber and outer space. our interests are aligned across many regions. we have a shared interest in stable, prosperous and integrated south asia, drawn together in a shared march to prosperity.we want an afghanistan that is shaped by the dreams of the great afghan people, not by irrational fears and overreaching ambitions of others.a peaceful, stable indian ocean region is vital for global commerce and prosperity. and, the future of asia pacific region will have profound impact on all of us. we both have huge stakes in west asia and the gulf.and, in africa, where, amidst many challenges, we see so many promising signs of courage, wisdom, leadership and enterprise. india has just held an africa summit, in which all 55 countries, and 42 leaders participated.we must also cooperate to launch a low carbon age for a sustainable future for our planet. this is a global responsibility that we must assume in paris later this month.the world has crafted a beautiful balance of collective action - common but differentiated responsibility and respective capabilities.those who have the means and the know-how must help meet the universal aspiration of humanity for clean energy and a healthy environment. and, when we speak of restraint, we must not only think of curbing fossil fuels, but also moderating our lifestyles.we must all do our part. for india, a target of 175 gw of additional capacity in renewable energy by 2022 and reduction in emission intensity of 33-35 % by 2030 are just two of the steps of a comprehensive strategy.i have also proposed to launch during the cop 21 meeting an international solar alliance to make solar energy an integral part of our lives, even in the most unconnected villages.in britain, you are more likely to use an umbrella against rain than the sun. but, my team defined the membership of the solar alliance in more precise terms: you have to be located within the tropics.and, we are pleased that the united kingdom qualifies! so, we look forward to an innovative britain as a valuable partner in this endeavour. prime minister cameron and i are, indeed, very pleased that cooperation on affordable and accessible clean energy is an important pillar of our relations.mr. speaker,this is a huge moment for our two great nations. so, we must seize our opportunities, remove the obstacles to cooperation, instill full confidence in our relations and remain sensitive to each other's interests.in doing so, we will transform our strategic partnership, and we will make this relationship count as one of the leading global partnerships. ever so often, in the call of britain's most famous bard that we must seize the tide in the affairs of men, the world has sought the inspiration to act. and, so must we.but, in defining the purpose of our partnership, we must turn to a great son of india, whose house in london i shall dedicate to the cause of social justice on saturday. dr. b. r. ambedkar, whose 125th birth anniversary we are celebrating now, was not just an architect of india's constitution and our parliamentary democracy. he also stood for the upliftment of the weak, the oppressed and the excluded. and, he lifted us all to a higher cause in the service of humanity; to build a future of justice, equality, opportunity and dignity for all humans; and, peace among people.that is the cause to which india and the united kingdom have dedicated themselves today.thank you very much, thanks a lot.highlightsi'm delighted to be london. even in this globalised world, london is still the standard of our times. it represents the finesse in human achievement.i'm truly honoured to speak in the british parliament. i know the parliament is not in session. prime minister cameron looks relaxed and relieved.i extend my good wishes to the labour. i extend warm greetings to the friends of india present here today.i will only say that many freedom fighters of india founders of india found their calling in the institutions of britain. from jawaharlal nehru to manmohan singh passed through the doors here.there are so much in common between the culture. we debate over the pitches of lord's and eden gardens.earlier we paid homage to mahatma gandhi's statue outside the parliament. i was asked about how that statue came about here. i said british were wise enough to recognise him, india was generous enough to share him.tomorrow we hope to be in wembley. it will be an expression of joy for all that we share - values, shares, political systems, sports, culture and art.the uk is the third largest investor in india behind singapore and mauritius. indians invest more in britain than in rest of the eu.our security agencies are working together so our children return home safe.it takes and indian icon tata to run a british icon and become the nation's largest private sector employer. and uk remains the preferred choice of indian students.india is newfound spot of hope and opportunity for the world.this year alone we have had three exercises together. your support has helped india take its rightful place in the global arena.it is not just about numbers. a nation of 1.25 billion people with 800 million is under 35 years. it is the reason of bold and sustained measure for reform.our momentum comes from the quality of life we seek for every citizen.in a nation connected by cell phones, digital india is changing the interface between citizens and world.the motto of sabka saath sabka vikas is a vision of participation and prosperity for every citizen.this is the timeless ethos of our culture and foundation of our constitution.we will open more doors of cooperation.ours is an age of multiple transitions in the world. we are yet to fully comprehend the future unfolding before us.",0.2063830575816878,pm modi uk : full text pm modi ' speech british parliament,"lord speaker , mr. speaker , mr. prime minister delighted london. even globalised world , london still standard times. city embraced world ' diversity represents finest human achievements. , truly honoured speak british parliament.mr. speaker , thank opening doors us , magnificent setting royal court. know parliament session. prime minister cameron looks relaxed relieved.but , want remind , mr. prime minister , owe royalty election slogan. know hosting chequers evening. , also know understand fair sides floor. especially since british mps indian origin evenly balanced treasury opposition benches. , also extend good wishes labour. indeed , since still early days election , warm congratulations members house. , greetings eminent leaders britain great friends india present today.so much modern history india linked building. much history looms across relationship. others spoken forcefully debts dues history. say many freedom fighters india found calling institutions britain. , many makers modern india , including several distinguished predecessors , jawaharlal nehru dr. manmohan singh , passed doors.there many things hard tell anymore british indian : jaguar scotland yard , example. brooke bond tea friend late lord ghulam nun ' curry. , strongest debates whether lord ' pitch swings unfairly wicket eden gardens cracks early. , love bhangra rap london like english novel india.on way event , prime minister cameron paid homage mahatma gandhi outside parliament. reminded question asked tour abroad. statue gandhi stands outside british parliament ? question , answer : british wise enough recognise greatness ; indians generous enough share ; fortunate enough touched life mission ; , smart enough use strengths connected histories power future relationship.so , stand today , visiting head government , given honour speak temple democracy. representative fellow institution shared tradition.and , tomorrow , prime minister wembley. even india , every young footballer wants bend like beckham. wembley celebration one-half-million threads life bind us ; one half million people -

2015-11-13,full text of pm modi's address at london business meet,"your excellency mr. david cameron!hon. mr. alan yarrow, the lord mayor of london!ladies and gentlemen!it is a great pleasure for me to be with you this evening. i must confess that there has been a delay in my coming to this great country. but, the good news is that myself and his excellency cameron have been in constant touch.we have been meeting frequently at various places and exchanging views. i remember our last meeting in new york where he rightly said that india and uk should work closely on the economic front.friends!uk and india have known each other very well since several centuries. our system of governance is also based largely on the westminster model.? our institutions know to interact with each other; ? our people know to work with each other; ? our businesses know to grow with each otherthat is the reason that uk is among india's major trading partners. uk is also the third largest foreign investor in india. and i must add - this is not one sided. india has emerged as the third largest source of fdi for uk. however, there is significant potential for india and uk to further strengthen their economic ties.we have to effectively leverage the mutual understanding which is there for each other. we are particularly keen to develop the sectors where uk is strong. we are working hard to create conducive conditions for this engagement. a strong indian community here keeps pushing us for better and better integration with uk.friends! since my government took over, we have been working relentlessly to put the economy on track. particularly, we have worked very aggressively to make india an easy and simple place to do business. we believe that this is necessary for improving the lives of ordinary citizens in india.the results of our hard work are now visible. imf chief has recently said that india is among few bright spots in global economy today. our growth rate in the last year was 7.3 per cent.the world bank has very recently projected our growth rate at 7.5per cent for this fiscal and even better in the coming years. thus, we are fortunate to be sailing in the right direction. in the world bank report of 2016 on ease of doing business, india has moved up by 12 ranks at one go. no other country has made such a big improvement.we are also committed to take these corrections at the state, district and city level. states are moving hand-in-hand with the federal government in this task in the spirit of cooperative and competitive federalism.recently, we did a ranking of our state governments on ease of doing business with the help of the world bank group. this has prompted the state governments into a healthy competition among themselves to ensure a business friendly eco-system.this was for the first time that the world bank involved itself in a sub-national exercise on ease of doing business.friends!one of the biggest challenges in india today is to productively employ the youth. for meeting this challenge, we need to provide a huge push to manufacturing which has stagnated at around 16 per cent of the gdp for several decades. this share must reach around 25per cent in the short and medium term. with this in view, we have launched the ""make in india"" initiative. we are working on all fronts to make india a global manufacturing hub.to achieve this objective, apart from vigorous exercise for ease of doing business, we have fast tracked approvals and clearances for industry and infrastructure. the hall mark of our strategy now is policy driven governance. measures like transparent auction and allocation of key natural resources like coal, spectrum, iron ore have created a level playing field for investors.to enhance the flow of foreign investments, we have liberalized the fdi regime allowing 100per cent fdi in railways. we enhanced the fdi limits to 49per cent in defence and insurance. we are also conscious of the last mile operational issues in such policies. in that spirit, early this week, we have carried out substantial changes in the fdi regime across 15 sectors.to give an example: now there are just no restrictions in the fdi policy for construction sector. similarly, very radical liberalization has been done in sectors like plantation, e-commerce and single brand retail. moreover, we have now brought most of the fdi proposals under the automatic route.with this round of reforms, i can say that india is among the most open countries for foreign investments.infrastructure is another big challenge for india. we are keen to build futuristic physical and social infrastructure. through self-imposed discipline in financial management, we have been able to allocate more resources for infrastructure sectors. in addition, we are setting up an india investment and infrastructure fund. we have targeted an annual contribution of 3.5 billion us dollars into this fund from our own resources. we are putting in place a professional team for asset management.we have also come up with the mechanism of tax free infrastructure bonds for projects in rail, road and other sectors. we will work together with the british government, industry and the financial markets to deepen our relationship and harness their interest in india's infrastructure. very soon, these bonds will become strong instruments for engagement between our financial markets.friends!there were a number of regulatory and taxation issues which were adversely impacting on the sentiments of foreign investors. we have taken very decisive steps to remove a number of long pending concerns.to give you some examples:? we have expedited regulatory clearances including security and environmental clearance;? we have increased the validity period of defence industrial licences up to eighteen years from three years previously;? we have taken almost 60 per cent of the defence items out of the licensing process and liberalised a number of restrictions like end-use certificate for the exports? we have clearly articulated that we will not resort to retrospective taxation and demonstrated this position in a number of ways? this includes not going for imposition of minimum alternate tax on fpis;? we have introduced the concept of composite sector caps for the fpis and other foreign investors.? we have notified the regulations for the alternative investment funds;? we have rationalized the capital gains tax regime for real estate investment trusts? we have modified the permanent establishment norms;? we have also decided to defer the implementation of the general anti-avoidance rules for two years;? we have introduced the gst bill in parliament; we are hopeful to roll it out in 2016;? we are working on a new bankruptcy code; the company law tribunal is soon going to be formed.friends!we want to make sure that our tax regime is transparent and predictable. we are also keen to see that genuine investors and honest tax payers get quick and fair decisions on tax matters.as a result of our initiatives,? the sentiments for private investment and inflow of foreign investment have turned positive.? fdi inflows have gone up by 40 per cent compared with previous year's corresponding period.? india has been recently ranked as the most attractive investment destinations by ernst & young? in a ranking of the top greenfield investment destinations in the first half of 2015, india is at number one.? foreign policy magazine of usa has ranked india as number one fdi destination.? in a study of 100 countries on growth, innovation and leadership, india has been ranked no.1 by frost & sullivan.? india has improved its unctad ranking of investment attractiveness from 15th to 9th.? india has also jumped 16 places on the world economic forum's global competitive index.? moody's have upgraded the rating of india as positive.thus, just in eighteen months, we have successfully restored the credibility of india in the eyes of global players. through ppp, we are encouraging private investments in areas where earlier only government used to invest. we are also divesting our stake in the public sector enterprises, to instill market discipline. we are keen to learn from your experience in structuring and implementing ppp projects.i am personally convinced and want to assure you that india is committed to protect intellectual property rights of all innovators and entrepreneurs. we have taken several initiatives for transparency and online processing in ip administration. a comprehensive national ipr policy is being finalized.friends!we want your active involvement in translating our dreams into reality. our commitment and aggressiveness to achieve the goal in a faster and effective manner offers immense opportunities to british companies. these opportunities range from building 50 million houses to setting up 100 smart cities; modernization of railway network and re-development of stations to new railway corridors; generation of 175 gw of renewable energy to transmission and distribution networks, from national highways and bridges, to metro rail networks. such a huge potential for creation of infrastructure and production of goods will not be available in any other country. more importantly, no one place on the earth can offer the potential for usage and consumption on such a massive scale.we are trying to harness this potential through our policies and people. the campaigns like digital india and skill india are designed to prepare the people to take part in this process. to tap their energy fully, we have also launched the start up india campaign. we have witnessed massive growth in the number of start-ups in the recent past. some of these have already begun to challenge established global players.friends!india is on the threshold of a big it revolution. we are encouraging it to fast-track the services to our 1.25 billion people. new technology and renewable energy is our new mantra. whatever we do, we will do in a cleaner and greener way. energy efficiency, water recycling, waste to energy, clean india and river cleaning are among those initiatives. these initiatives provide additional avenues for investment in modern technology and human resources.ours is a country of the vibrant youth and a rising middle class. there is a huge domestic market in india. i have been saying that the three ds of democracy, demography and demand is our basic strength. moreover, talented young minds in india have now begun taking risks. they are preferring to become entrepreneurs. thus, we have moved forward from d to e which is entrepreneurship.friends!necessary conditions for take-off of the indian economy have been created. never before, india was so well prepared to absorb talent, technology and investment from outside. i can assure you that it will get better and better in the coming days. we will be open to welcome your ideas, innovations and enterprises. we are open to carry out necessary corrections in our policies and procedures. given the visionary and dynamic leadership of prime minister cameron and his interest in india, i am personally eager to work with the british government and companies.with these words, i welcome you to india. i assure you of my personal care in making your dreams a reality. many of you belong to india; many of you are in india already. but for those who are not there, i must say that:? at this point of time, it is wiser to be in india;? further, we are making it easier to invest in indiaand? believe me, we are making it even better to 'make in india'.thank you. thank you very much.",0.14641572713001288,full text pm modi ' address london business meet,"excellency mr. david cameron ! hon. mr. alan yarrow , lord mayor london ! ladies gentlemen ! great pleasure evening. must confess delay coming great country. , good news excellency cameron constant touch.we meeting frequently various places exchanging views. remember last meeting new york rightly said india uk work closely economic front.friends ! uk india known well since several centuries. system governance also based largely westminster model. ?

2016-03-28,godrej business head speaks on changing education needs: practicality over academics,"the india today education team caught up with godrej consumer products ltd (gcpl) business head (india and saarc), sunil kataria, who was felicitated with the 'distinguished alumnus award 2016' at imt ghaziabad's 'annual convocation 2016' on march 16. kataria spoke about much-needed changes in the education sector, the importance of holistic and vocational education, and the 'job creator' mindset.some excerpts from the interview:-what is your take on holistic growth in the education sector?sk: education has to become much more practical, rather than just being academic. the top ten academic highest scorers of a batch need not be the most successful in future. there is a reason behind this: education can be only the means to an end, but the larger success takes place through what is called leadership. education cannot teach you leadership; education can only prepare you for leadership.i believe this realisation is there and a shift is happening in more and more schools, not just business schools, but in all higher education institutions, that apart from preparing students for academics, what we need to prepare them for, is leadership in the world.-is this shift in the educational process taking place fast enough?sk: this shift is not taking place fast enough. leadership involves behaviour. it's about how you behave in your social environment, when you are faced with challenges, and how to behave in people management. our education system is based on rote learning; it's not going to change easily, it will take some time. the realisation is there, but the shift is not happening at the pace where it should happen.-what instances of realisation do you see happening?sk: there are small scale changes being implemented, such as international school programmes, which are following a different kind of curriculum, not based on rote learning. in many schools now, even in the indian system of education, such as in cbse and icse, you can clearly see that large weightageis being given to extra-curricular activities, especially when recognition of students is concerned. in colleges, there is definitely a much more project-based learning coming in, focusing on real life situations.the education system will take time to change, but while that happens, what we can do is give students across all educational institutions exposure to real life situations through life projects. that would make a very big difference.-what is your take on the age-old traditional education systems like that established by rabindranath tagore in visva bharati university in shantiniketan? do you think we should go back to this system?sk: i feel that the world is very dynamic right now and we shouldn't get stuck in one particular way of education. there is a good amount of learning in every approach. what has happened in the last three years has not happened in the last 300 years! no education alone can prepare you for this change.now we see 30-year-olds starting their own companies, making profit and folding their companies. these companies, which are turning into 'unicorns' in terms of valuation, are run by people who might not even have 'qualified education'. what they have is imagination, entrepreneurial streak, and leadership skills.so, i think we shouldn't be debating between an international approach or a domestic approach or a hybrid approach. what we need to understand is that there is a world out there seeking strong, practical, entrepreneurial, leadership behaviours. the content of education is obviously important, but what is needed along with the content, is the right behaviour and the right approach.-with initiatives like digital india and make in india transforming the face of indian economy, we face a severe shortage of skilled workers who can carry out these initiatives to perfection. what changes should educational institutes implement to churn out skilled workers?sk: we are now going through a time which is fundamentally different from the past in terms of technology. there is a generation which is still catching up to the digital changes-the digital catch-ups; the generation in their teens, up to around the age of 25, are the digital natives. they have grown up in this digital age and are adapting to the technological changes in the past few years. then, a third generation has already come in-toddlers who are playing with tablets and mobile phones-the digital born. there is yet another generation, the digital laggards-old people who do not want to become digital now. however, they are not a part of the economy anymore.the economy is going to be driven right now by digital natives, and what would very soon hit us, is the digital born. to bring in these changes, digitality has to become a part of our existence and digital understanding has to be strongly implemented by educational institutions.-how important is skilling and vocational education?sk: vocational education is not limited to one field; it can be in any field. large scale boom in economy takes place when economic growth trickles down to small towns and rural areas as well. in such smaller towns and areas, the economic growth will take place through smaller rudimentary industries, such as cottage industries. vocational training helps one contribute a lot in such smaller enterprises as it gives you direct skills which can be immediately implemented.-with this economic growth, talk has come in of being 'job creators' instead of just workers. how can this new mindset be implemented in the new generations?sk: this is something that is happening on its own along with the culture change. around 30 years ago, people would look for conventional jobs such as doctors or mbas. since disposable income was still very low in india, it was about creating safety for the future, and only then, experimenting. the indian salary has boomed in the last 15 years, and the country has become completely globalised in the last decade. so, india now has a huge disposable income and has moved from a saving mindset to a consumer mindset. that's a big change.the current generation is a consumer generation and is not bothered much about savings. by and large, the parents of this generation are more well-to-do than the parents of the previous generation. this security cover that they have, along with the consumer mindset and the globalised approach, makes them a risk-taking generation. moreover, they also have funding available. when all these factors are put together, the job creator mindset will come automatically. all we can do now is create an environment for them which is positive for doing business.uday kotak and kamal nath felicitating sunil katariauday kotak, executive vice chairman and managing director of kotak mahindra bank, who graced the event as the chief guest, also pointed out the educational changes needed in a world that is fast changing.""the world is changing, and in future, the degree is just the means to an end, and not the end itself. at all ages, it is important to unlearn what has been learned and to relearn,"" he said.""it is not about what you learn, but how you learn. the challenge lies in filtering the available content, adapting it and absorbing it,"" said kamal nath, the president of the governing council of imt ghaziabad.""twenty years ago, the world was something else and it has changed now. however, the working and the process in educational institutes has remained the same,"" nath added.nath elaborated on the role that management education has to play in this changing world scenario.

""our devices are completely make in india and were manufactured at our haridwar-based manufacturing unit,"" ringing bells founder and ceo mohit goel was quoted by ians as saying. however former dipp secretary amitabh kant has categorically stated that the freedom 251 had nothing to do with make in india. dipp is the nodal agency behind the make in india campaign. ringing bells is yet to clarify on the particular make in india that it keeps harping about. if it just means that it's making these phones exclusively in india, then how is it able to bear such a formidable loss per unit, despite being a startup? it is clearly not answering all the questions.why re-booking?according to ringing bells, it hopes to make profit on volumes and economics of scale. ""we will have a loss, but i am happy that the dream of connecting rural and poor indians as part of the digital india and make in india initiatives has been fulfilled with freedom 251,"" goel was further quoted by ians as saying. if such was the case, the company would ramp up on volumes, and try to sell as many units as possible. on the contrary, it has gone down from its initial claim of 25 lakh units to just 2 lakh. the company would open a second phase of registrations for the freedom 251 after shipping the first 2 lakh units. it's not clear why it would need a second round of registration after 7 crore people already registered for it in the first round. the company claims that 30,000 people paid for booking the phones in the first run before it started offering cash on delivery.""we don't want money from customers initially. we have investors to back our project. there is a business model to justify the price. we have a foolproof plan and to whomsoever we have disclosed it has agreed to it. i don't want to disclose full details as of now,"" goel had said exclusively to india today.also read: two lakh units of rs 251 phone ready, says ringing bells; to launch cheapest hd led tv will the real freedom 251 please stand up?ringing bells is yet to disclose the name of its investors. if it had a firm backing, and was looking to play the volume game, why is it that it did not have an original unit to showcase at the launch event in february? moreover, it was later found that the freedom 251 units that were handed over to journalists at the launch were in fact adcom ikon 4 units disguised with whitener fluid. adcom owner sanjeev bhatia later confirmed that the phone which ringing bells was showing off as its own was actually been bought from his company and wasn't produced by ringing bells at all. to this day, ringing bells fails to put up the actual freedom 251 phone image and/or features on its official website. a number of images now doing the rounds on the web do show off the phone in question, but that doesn't explain why ringing bells would have trouble putting up the phone on their website with full details.too good to be trueaccording to ringing bells, it has outsourced the task of assembling freedom 251 to two production units, vie technology and eminence technologies. speaking exclusively to india today, the company had confirmed that it had placed orders to manufacture 50 lakh units of the phone at these facilities. while eminence technologies was approached only five days before the launch, vie technology was still waiting on a green signal to start assembling the phone as of march 10. now manufacturing 50 lakh units is a herculean task, even more so for a startup. but, for a company relying heavily on economics of scale, the initial bout of laziness does come down as a major surprise.also read: adcom terms freedom 251 scam of millennium, ringing bells clarifies",0.09292857142857144,"freedom 251 shipping , big questions remain ringing bells phone","noida-based startup ringing bells pvt ltd start delivering rs 251 smartphone , aka freedom 251 , june 30. supposed start delivering promise ultra-affordable smartphone latest june 28 , although original promise sell freedom 251 market end february. yes , phone delayed. yet , nothing short miracle phone finally going available. far good , although little bit delay.now , prospects fully-functional rs 251 phone may sound tempting , , remember , ringing bells slacking day one. initial promise delivering nearly 25 lakh handsets june 30 , come modest number two lakh. forget , grown mum initial phase pomp grandeur. still advise caution. fact , still many questions need answer ringing bells providing any.make india not?make india not?ringing bells claims mojo behind incredibly cheap freedom 251 phone make india ( start india ) . fact gone say rs 251 smartphone showcase make india.

2016-08-21,"are you a criminal now? users may get 3 years in jail for viewing torrent site, blocked url in india","call it the new digital india. the indian government, with the help of internet service providers, and presumably under directives of court, has banned thousands of websites and urls in the last five odd years. but until now if you somehow visited these ""blocked urls"" all was fine. however, now if you try to visit such urls and view the information, you may get three-year jail sentence as well as invite a fine of rs 3 lakh.this is just for viewing a torrent file, or downloading a file from a host that may have been banned in india, or even for viewing an image on a file host like imagebam. you don't have to download a torrent file, and then the actual videos or other files, which might have copyright. just accessing information under a blocked url will land you in jail and leave your bank account poorer by rs 3 lakh.also read: it's over! torrentz, world's top torrent search engine, shuts down if you visit such a url, you will be shown the following warning.""this url has been blocked under the instructions of the competent government authority or in compliance with the orders of a court of competent jurisdiction. viewing, downloading, exhibiting or duplicating an illicit copy of the contents under this url is punishable as an offence under the laws of india, including but not limited to under sections 63, 63-a, 65 and 65-a of the copyright act, 1957 which prescribe imprisonment for 3 years and also fine of upto rs. 3,00,000/-. any person aggrieved by any such blocking of this url may contact at urlblock@tatacommunications.com who will, within 48 hours, provide you the details of relevant proceedings under which you can approach the relevant high court or authority for redressal of your grievance""this is a change compared to the earlier message that users would encounter on the blocked urls in india. the earlier message would read that the url has been blocked at the direction of dot. of late, however, the government bodies were not only experimenting in how to implement the blocks but were also trying to figure what message to show to users. recently, the blocked urls also gave out not reachable error without specifying any message.in india, most of the urls and websites were blocked using dns-filtering. this means the dns of the blocked site was added to a list maintained by the internet service provider and whenever a user tried connecting to that site, the dns server of the internet service provider would block that request. however, this was easy to bypass as a lot of people started using - or were already using - third-party dns services such as those maintained by google. it is also ineffective if a site uses https or in other words encryption to secure the network between the user's computer and the site server.but in the last couple of years internet service providers, probably at the request of government bodies, have invested lot more in bolstering the mechanism through which they block websites. indian government bodies too, instead of relying on internet service providers that are many, has started bring into play the big companies like tata communications and airtel that manage a number of internet gateways in india.the latest warning message clearly implies that the url blocking is now happening at the internet gateways - in this particular case for the example the gateway is seemingly managed by tata communications - and that is more difficult to circumvent. the connection on which this message was served is from mtnl. but the message came from tata communications. we sent an email to tata communications at the specified address to get more information but it bounced back (see above).while the message in itself is ominous and surely must have been vetted by a government body, it is not clear how it will be enforced. it doesn't look possible that the government will be monitoring the whole world wide web, looking for people may access or try to access a blocked url. it is also not clear how, if someone does land in trouble for accessing a blocked url in india, will be prosecuted and what process will be followed.lack of clarity on it as well as no prior information on something like this, which may make, almost every web user in india a criminal, does indicate that this is just a message and not any sort of official government policy, which is going to be enforced. however, at the same, it is also clear that the mere presence of this message to web users mean that they may end up in trouble if a government body or cops do decided to follow through on anything that they believe is an ""offence under the laws of india, including but not limited to under sections 63, 63-a, 65 and 65-a of the copyright act, 1957"".blame it on john doethe problem, for now, doesn't seem to that india is moving to block half of the internet through a policy the way china does. instead, the issue is likely due to the john doe orders that indian courts are issuing at the regular interval at the request of content creators like bollywood film makers. the lawyers of film studios often approach courts ahead of a movie's release seeking preventive blocks on the urls they compile in the list.also read: torrentz.eu clone is up but 5 reasons why you should not use it in reality these lists are poorly compiled and often block is sought on full websites just on the basis of whims and fancies. however, courts have regularly issued orders in the favour of film studios in india. these court orders are issued against john doe or in other words an unnamed entity that may indulge in piracy of the film.once this order is issued, the copies of the order along with the list of urls to be blocked go to dot, which them passes an order to internet service providers to block these sites. the interesting bit here is that once a url is blocked it remains blocked, even years after the release of the film.update: the new message that you may have started seeing on the ""blocked"" urls in india is possibly result of a recent court directive. according to spicyip, bombay high court recently asked internet service providers in india to not just block urls but also explain to users why the urls are blocked and possibly warn them of consequences of illegally accessing copyright work. the idea is to tell consumers that downloading a film is illegal. the idea is to tell them that if they download a film, they will face trouble. however, it seems that tata, which in this case allegedly came up with the wordings of the message, slipped. it came up with a message that is incredibly poorly worded and the intend to convey something more than what was implied. the message not only implies that you may get in trouble if you download a film but may also face the law if you just manage to access that url and ""view"" the content of the url. as of now, it is clear that you may land up in jail -- or at least in trouble -- if someone pushes for it. now, it is possible whatever charges you face if you visit a blocked may not hold up in the court but as far as the warning message is concerned, it makes it clear that visiting any blocked url in india -- and not just a torrent url -- has potential to land a web user in trouble.also read: the 3 years jail fiasco for torrents shows absurdity of india's john doe orders",0.043272164343592906,"criminal ? users may get 3 years jail viewing torrent site , blocked url india","call new digital india. indian government , help internet service providers , presumably directives court , banned thousands websites urls last five odd years. somehow visited "" blocked urls "" fine. however , try visit urls view information , may get three-year jail sentence well invite fine rs 3 lakh.this viewing torrent file , downloading file host may banned india , even viewing image file host like imagebam.

2016-09-12,skilling india: need for an integrated approach ,"sitting on the cusp of radical transformation, india aims for 'rapid changes not gradual evolution,' hence demanding 'actions, not (sheer) ideas, intent and promises'. on one hand national aspirations billed in schemes like 'swachh bharat', 'make in india', 'smart cities', 'skill india', 'digital india' and the likes demand a huge number of skilled hands giving effect to them. on the other hand, we find skill gaps and unemployability as the major hot button issues staring in the face of the nation. it is going to be an extensive, well-orchestrated effort. why does india need to skill its youth?india, with its demographic dividend of 144 million youth in 18-23 age bracket needs to, relevantly skill its youth to enable them to contribute to the country's growth process. for the big quantum leap, we wish to make in terms of progress.the cruciality of a skilled work force has already thrown the state machinery into action, leaving no stone unturned to meet the set targets and deadlines. a very ambitious 'skill india' initiative aims to train about 30 crores people by the year 2020. though it has been an inclusive approach there is a special thrust on those at the bottom of pyramid figuring around 800 million citizens.predicted talent crunchalso, it is predicted that the developed but ageing world may go through a talent crunch of over 56 million people by the year 2030. india can play a leading supplier of talent with around 47 million trained workers to fill-in this gap. government in full throttlethe central leadership is working full throttle to train and skill the youth through its various schemes and initiatives. under various efforts by the national skill development council, the government approach has been very elaborate, inclusive, inter-sectoral and integrated.the prime minister speaking at niti aayog recently reiterated the need to break the silos and develop cross sector functionality. the reference was to the government structure. but in the same construction, we can work in context of skill development. nsdc has been working across 32 sectors, covering 416 job roles to develop skills in the work force. governance has to be 'integrative'-- integrative of diversity in terms of sectors, functions, social and economic strata. prime minister's kaushal vikas yojana (pmkvy) working in the same spirit aims at providing 60 lakh youth with the opportunity to get trained assessed and certified. also, there are schemes taking care of the prior learning, and accordingly aligning the competencies of 40 lakh individuals from the unorganised workforce. pmkvy currently has over 74,000 enrolments. out of these, 20,000 have already completed their training and around 12,000 have been certified. need for skilled people to meet our aimsthose planning the trajectory of skill development have to plan along two very essential elements. the bigger picture they have, the skills required for the same and the human resources available at hand. these have to fall in place. let us work with the example of smart cities. needed skills will span over the sectors of power, sanitation and sewage disposal, horticulture, web services providers, public transport, it and many more. and the story isn't complete yet. also it will engage a huge number of engineers, architects, city planners, road layers, menial workers, masons, brick-layers, transporters, gardeners, daily wagers and a whole lot of skilled hands for the upkeep. with vision and prescience, we can ensure required skill sets are there.how to engage those not formally educated?we as a society are working to groom a reservoir of young talent that it is elite, educated and equipped with the latest breakthroughs in knowledge. but, what of the millions who have missed the bus of formal education? how do you engage them productively so they are integrated into the mainstream and don't end up on the wrong side of the law? skill them appropriately. educate them about the norms of work and life and give them the much needed dignity of labour. an offshoot of this is dipping crime rates.a society needs a broad spectrum of skills. it needs engineers, scientists, and doctors as much as it needs the sanitation workers or plumbers or electricians. an integrative and inclusive approach would give a holistic and sustainable solution to skill requirements. can we manage the country sans any one of the mentioned skill-set? imagine sanitation workers going on strike. need to complement cross-functionalitywe need to complement cross-functionality with excellence at all levels-- excellence that becomes the norm and abhors mediocrity. if india needs to be a global leader then it has to play a pivotal role in the world affairs and economy. as of now, even with its mammoth demography, that constitutes 18 per cent of the global population, india accounts only for two per cent of the global exports. hence, there is a need for excellence. ""the society which scorns excellence in plumbing as a humble activity and tolerates shoddiness in philosophy because it is an exalted activity will have neither good plumbing nor good philosophy: neither its pipes nor its theories will hold water,"" goes the adage.quality needs to be centre stage at all levels of educationin all our endeavours, quality needs to be centre stage-- starting from the schools to the institutions of higher learning. a substandard primary phase later metastasises into a stream of graduates that who do not have the required talent levels and skill sets, and there begins the chaos. having an army of youth flush with adrenaline but not knowing how to cater to the needs of self, organisation and the society is not of much use. we need to correct the narrative, which at times seems to have gone awry. basics are as important in the script of a worthy citizen as are the professional skills. primary education is the foundation of life. it has to be driven by conscientious professionals only. social and political structures are important skill development factorsit is not always the funds that fuel growth. many a time, it is the social and political culture we establish. a social structure that weaves into its young growing minds the discipline, commitment and sincerity towards their work and nation is essential. punch-ins or cameras can't inculcate what good education can-- discipline and attitudinal honesty. finally, an overhaul of the dated institutions can boost the production to a globally expected level. when we say production, it takes in its ambit goods, services, talent and human resources. functional silos are modern day dinosaurs. let us perpetuate the culture of cross functionality.skill india aims to train about 30 crores people by the year 2020. and this has to be an integrated bracket. the state machinery is already on the job. there are schemes, initiatives, special projects, kaushal melas (fair). we seem to be moving in the right direction though such changes take time.-authored by dr uday salunkhe, group director, welingkar institute of management development and research (weschool)read: studying

2016-09-26,sushma swaraj at unga: full text of the speech,"external affairs minister sushma swaraj did not leave any stone unturned in her efforts to condemn the perpetrators of terror during her speech at the united nations general assembly in new york.swaraj in her indisputable jibe at pakistan stated that it should abandon its ambitions to claim kashmir. in her speech she reiterated that jammu and kashmir was an integral part of india and will continue to remain so.in her comments condemning acts of terrorism across the world, she stated that nations which are haven to terrorists should be isolated from the global community.here is her full speech:on behalf of india and on my own behalf, i congratulate you on your election as president of the 71st united nations general assembly. let me also take this opportunity to thank secretary general ban ki moon for his services to the united nations, history's largest peace movement.mr. president,a year has passed since i stood here at this hallowed podium to address the members of the international community. since then, much has changed in the world around us - some for the better, some for the worse and much which has been cause of great concern. there can be no better platform to ponder our actions and our achievements over the last year. we must remember that we will be defined not just by our actions, but equally, by our inaction.mr. president,a number of issues have been debated in this august assembly - from the necessity of global partnerships in sharing new vaccines and promoting access to affordable drugs to counter anti-microbial resistance, to the need for faster implementation of the sendai framework to mitigate the risk of natural disasters. from the challenge of ensuring well-ordered mobility of productive human resources, to the necessity of adequate consultations with troop contributing countries before framing mandates for un peacekeeping operations. but my time is limited. i would therefore, focus only on some of the most pressing issues facing the international community.also read : rattled pakistan shifts 17 terror camps in pok to army bases, civilian areas, say intel agencies mr. president,the true challenge of our time is to end the curse of harsh poverty that still lurks in so many corners of our world; to ensure that the fruits of growing prosperity reach those who need it most; to take forward the mission of gender equality and protect women where there is gender regression; and to ensure peace across boundaries, not least because there can be no prosperity without peace.i congratulate you for the priority you have given to the sustainable development goals (sdgs) by making them the theme for the 71st unga. i am happy that the 17 goals adopted by this assembly are matched by the development vision of my government, which is geared towards the achievement of these same objectives. under the swachh bharat mission (clean india campaign), more than 400,000 toilets have been constructed in schools. the beti bachao beti padhao (educate the girl child, save the girl child) programme has become a nation-wide mission. the make in india brand is receiving international acclaim. almost 250 million bank accounts have been opened for the poor under the jan dhan yojana, the largest financial inclusion programme the world has ever seen. digital india is transforming the country. under the skill india initiative, a number of programmes are underway to enable youth to reap the demographic dividend. these initiatives have added a new dimension to india's growth story, making it the fastest growing major economy in the world at a time of slow global growth.mr. president,we are all aware that 1/6th of humanity lives in india. therefore global success in realizing sdgs depends on the success achieved in india. we are committed to the wholehearted implementation of the agenda 2030 as a national effort. we have decided to dedicate one day in each session of our parliament for discussions only on sdgs. this will enable us to constantly monitor their progress and this will give us good results.also read: us welcomes india's decision to ratify the climate change protocol this year however, in a globalised world, national effort needs to be supplemented by international cooperation for the successful implementation of agenda 2030.mr. president,climate change is yet another serious challenge confronting us. there are enough resources on this planet to fulfil everyone's needs, but not enough to fulfil anyone's greed, for greed is limitless. in this context pm modi has championed a new concept - climate justice. if we respect nature, nature will respect and nurture us and future generations. but, if we exploit nature mindlessly, then we must be mindful that nature will unleash its fury upon us. in different parts of the world, we have already seen nature drift towards the unnatural - from torrential rain to excessive heat, from tsunamis to storms and cloudbursts.we must curb reckless consumption, and adopt lifestyles in harmony with nature. yoga, the storehouse of india's ancient wisdom, epitomises a sustainable lifestyle. let me record our gratitude for the unprecedented global response to the international day of yoga.in the paris agreement, the principle of 'common but differentiated responsibilities' and 'respective capabilities' has been acknowledged and accepted. this makes clear that while our responsibility is common, obligations are different. developed nations must discharge their responsibility in the search for the common good, with finance and technology transfer.india has launched an ambitious domestic effort to transform our energy mix to achieve 40% energy from non-fossil fuel sources by 2030. the massive investments required entail a predictable and stable environment towards which we are working actively. apart from this, our path-breaking initiative for an international solar alliance is intended to make efficient solar technology available for all.also read: don't reward or rebuke muslims; empower them, says pm modi at bjp conclave i assure this assembly that india will continue to play a leading role in combating climate change. we have decided to submit our instrument of ratification of the paris agreement on october 2, the birth anniversary of mahatma gandhi who epitomised a lifestyle with the smallest carbon footprint.mr. president,let me now turn to a subject of the most critical importance, one which deeply concerns every member of this assembly. this month we marked the 15th anniversary of the 9/11 terror attacks on this city. tragically, less than 15 days ago, another attempt at killing innocents was made through an act of terror in this same city. we, who have suffered in uri recently, understand the pain inflicted by the same forces. the world has been battling this scourge for long. however, despite the blood and tears of innocent victims, attacks this year alone in kabul and dhaka, istanbul and mogadishu, brussels and bangkok, paris, pathankot and uri as well as daily barbaric tragedies in syria and iraq, remind us that these malevolent forces are yet to be defeated.also read: modi calls islamabad sole exporter of terrorism; asks people of pakistan to fight against poverty we must acknowledge that terrorism is undoubtedly the biggest violation of human rights. it targets the innocent and kills indiscriminately. terrorism has gone way beyond affecting individuals or nations - it is a crime against humanity itself. but it is important to ask - who is behind this and who benefits from it? terrorists do not own banks or weapons factories, so let us ask the real question: who finances these terrorists, who arms them and provides sanctuaries? we heard similar questions being asked by afghanistan from this podium.mr. president,history proves that those who seed extremist ideologies, reap a bitter harvest. the germ of evil has grown into a hydra-headed monster, backed by technological sophistication that threatens the peace and harmony of our world. we will not be able to win against terrorism by making specious distinctions between your problems and mine, between terrorists who attack you and those who attack me. for we do not know who this frankenstein's monster will devour next.therefore if we want to defeat terrorism, there is only one way - that we unite across our differences, add steel to our resolve and inject urgency in our response. we need to forget our prejudices and join hands together to script an effective strategy against terror. this is not an impossible task provided we have the will. we can do it, we must do it. otherwise our future generations will forever hold us to account. and if any nation refuses to join this global strategy, then we must isolate it.also read: india today at loc: after uri attack, india quietly fortifies border positions, locals worry about escalation in our midst, there are nations that still speak the language of terrorism, that nurture it, peddle it, and export it. to shelter terrorists has become their calling card. we must identify these nations and hold them to account. these nations, in which un designated terrorists roam freely, lead processions and deliver their poisonous sermons of hate with impunity, are as culpable as the very terrorists they harbour. such countries should have no place in the comity of nations.mr. president,on 21st september, the prime minister of pakistan used this podium to make baseless allegations about human rights violations in my country. i can only say that those accusing others of human rights violations would do well to introspect and see what egregious abuses they are perpetrating in their own country, including in balochistan. the brutality against the baloch people represents the worst form of state oppression.mr. president,the prime minister of pakistan also said that india has placed pre-conditions for talks which are not acceptable to him. what pre-conditions? did we impose any pre-condition before extending an invitation for the oath-taking ceremony of our government? did we impose any pre-condition when i went to islamabad for the heart of asia conference and agreed to begin the comprehensive bilateral dialogue? did we impose any pre-condition when prime minister modi travelled from kabul to lahore? what pre-conditions? we took the initiative to resolve issues not on the basis of conditions, but on the basis of friendship! we have in fact attempted a paradigm of friendship in the last two years which is without precedent. we conveyed eid greetings to the prime minister of pakistan, wished success to his cricket team, extended good wishes for his health and well being. did all this come with pre-conditions attached?also read: rattled pakistan shifts 17 terror camps in pok to army bases, civilian areas, say intel agencies and what did we get in return? pathankot, bahadur ali, and uri. bahadur ali is a terrorist in our custody, whose confession is a living proof of pakistan's complicity in cross-border terror. but when confronted with such evidence, pakistan remains in denial. it persists in the belief that such attacks will enable it to obtain the territory it covets. my firm advice to pakistan is: abandon this dream. let me state unequivocally that jammu and kashmir is an integral part of india and will always remain so.mr. president,as i said at the very beginning, we will be judged by our action and equally by our inaction. what goals have we achieved and what objectives remain unfulfilled? i would like to highlight two such pending tasks of this assembly.the ccit was proposed by india in 1996. in 2016, despite the passage of two decades, we are yet to come to a conclusion. as a result, we are unable to develop a norm under which terrorists shall be prosecuted or extradited. therefore it is my appeal that this general assembly acts with fresh resolve and urgency to adopt this critical convention.also read: sacrifice of 18 soldiers will not go in vain, will isolate pakistan: modi in kozhikode just as we need a more contemporary approach to combating terrorism, we also need a less outdated security council that continues to reflect the world order of an earlier era. the vast majority of nations share the belief that the un should not remain frozen in 1945, just to serve the interests of a few. whether it is institutions or issues, we must come to terms with present day realities and the challenges that confront us. an expansion in the permanent and non-permanent membership of the council to reflect contemporary realities is therefore, an urgent necessity. we must move forward substantively towards text-based negotiations.mr. president,if both these long pending issues are addressed during your presidency, the success of this session will be ensured.the 21st century has begun in the shadow of turmoil, but we can turn this into a golden age in the history of civilization through united and concerted efforts. but what happens tomorrow will depend on what we do today.thank you.",0.06827568689813587,sushma swaraj unga : full text speech,"external affairs minister sushma swaraj leave stone

2016-12-27,5 education trends of 2016 that will continue to impact in 2017 ,"the year 2016 was a vibrant one for the education sector. several new developments took place and a gamut of themes and issues gathered pace to further transform the education landscape for the better. the two biggest beneficiaries of these changes have been the learner, who is at the centre of the learning eco-system, and the teacher, who is the principal pivot in this eco-system.below are the top 5 themes that we believe dominated the education landscape in 2016 and will continue to impact the sector through 2017 as well:1integrated and theme-based learning sharesintegrated learning solutions that seamlessly combine print and digital modes have made their presence felt this year. it is important that the content which is being delivered in classroom settings through different mediums is consistent so that it can provide context and enable optimum learning outcomes.in addition to print and digital integration, it is important for such solutions to be teacher-friendly, assessment-enabled, and theme or activity-based as well. theme-based learning modules enable contextual learning through multiple disciplines which clears the concepts of learners to a great extent.if this approach can be delivered with proper teacher support along with high standards, it can soon become the biggest disrupter in modern-day schooling in the coming years.2assessments to measure performance sharestoday, assessments have been established as a potent tool which can not only measure the learner's performance, but can also modulate the overall teaching strategy with the help of analytics in formative assessments. the year 2016 saw a massive focus on measurement of student outcomes and performance, in both online and offline mediums. integrated and more developed assessment solutions that provide detailed analytics on student performance should develop further in 2017.3professional development of teachers sharesthere was a lot of focus on the training and professional development of teachers in 2016, starting with the introduction of the pandit madan mohan malviya new teachers training programme announced by the government in the union budget of 2016. shortage of trained teachers is a recognised hurdle in improving learning outcomes in the country. a continued focus on the professional development of teachers through a combination of online and offline learning modules is critical, given their pivotal role and contribution in the education ecosystem.4bilingual learning medium for young adults sharesindia has a large and diverse learner base which is multilingual. in order to expand the reach of education, it becomes imperative for learning organisations to develop content that is either in the native language of the learner or bilingual, in view of the english language use in commerce and industry. experiments have shown that the use of mother tongue to deliver learning instructions enables faster and better understanding of concepts, especially in the case of young adults. given india's young demographic and their linguistic characteristics, bilingual learning material is probably more relevant today than ever before!5digital proliferation in education sharesthe internet and its proliferation through affordable and accessible devices have redefined learning ability and in 2016, pushed us closer towards universal education. now, we can learn from anywhere and at any time, unconstrained by factors like time and place, thanks to mooc websites and apps such as khan academy and coursera. the digital literacy mission was announced as part of the union budget 2016 to cover 60 million rural households within the next three years.

2017-01-31,5 problems with teachers in rural areas which are blocking india's educational growth,"one of the biggest concerns of educators across the world, and especially in india, is making the present generation learners future-ready. india is relatively young as a nation with around 28 million youth population being added every year. more than 50 per cent of its population is below the age of 25 and more than 65 per cent are aged below 35. in 2020, the average age of an indian is expected to be 29 years, while it will be 37 for china and 48 for japan. however, india's high youth population won't be of help to the economy if universal education is not achieved all over india.the main problem india now faces is that all the pedagogical innovations are fit to improve the quality of urban education while the rural learners and their education remain largely neglected. with 65 per cent of the population residing in rural india, education there truly deserves much more attention, especially when it is plagued with so many problems - dearth of teachers, teacher absenteeism and poor quality of teachers.1. non-permanence of teachers is demotivatingmost of the schools in rural areas are run by the government. they appoint ad hoc teachers, instead of permanent ones, who are poorly paid as compared to the huge remuneration of a full-time trained graduate teacher (tgt).moreover, promising career prospects, which is quite a motivation booster, is almost nil for the non-permanent teachers. this leads to dissatisfaction, eventually resulting in a dearth of teachers because they move away to more permanent jobs.2. late or blatantly absentlack of accountability of teachers and school authorities has raised the rate of absenteeism. school development and management committees (sdmcs), comprising parents and members of the local community, have been entrusted with the responsibility of overseeing teachers and their duties. however, research suggests that the committee has hardly seen success.3. non-teaching dutiesmoreover, non-teaching duties like election invigilation often keep teachers away from schools. furthermore, teachers often have to report for duty far away from their home. with an inadequate transport system in rural india, the distance only adds to their woes and often results in absenteeism.4. exemption from tetseveral states have exempted candidates from teachers' eligibility test (tet) as only 20 per cent of the aspirants clear it. this wrong move, in an attempt to quickly fix the issue of dearth of teachers, has deteriorated the quality of education in the states even further. however, quality of teachers is a major concern not only in these states, but across the entire country.5. lack of quality teacher trainingthere are many private teacher-training institutes in india, but the quality of the training they provide is unsatisfactory. continuous professional development is a motivator for teachers, and enough attention is needed in this regard.digital aids to the rescuemany remedies such as surprise school inspections, teacher-training courses etc. have been attempted to salvage the rural education scenario. without being dismissive of any of these, i would like to point out the effectiveness of digital aids in battling the challenges plaguing our education system. this front has benefited, and gained visibility, thanks to some potential ventures by both government and non-government initiatives alike.government initiativesattuned to the modi government's digital india initiative, a couple of projects have been introduced in the school education segment.for instance, e-basta aims to make digital education via tablets and computers accessible to learners in rural areas. digital learning can help develop critical thinking skills. the project aims not only to benefit learners in learning concepts, but also to make them comfortable with technology. steps are already being taken to introduce digital aids in preschools. though digital aids can never really replace teachers, initiatives of these kinds can make quality content available to them.again, rashtriya madhyamik shiksha abhiyan (rmsa), in partnership with state governments, is dedicated to enhance the capacity of all teachers in information and communications technology (ict).many teachers are not tech-savvy, and the teacher-training courses never really prepare them to handle digital aids in classrooms. such schemes can go a long way in keeping them motivated besides improving their competence.non-government initiativesevidyaloka, a non-profit organisation, connects rural learners and teaching volunteers through digital classrooms. the passionate teachers are a varied bunch, consisting of housewives, it professionals and retired defence personnel. the evidyaloka team organises skype classes according to the availability of volunteers and batch sizes.although there is a shortage of teachers in our country, a huge number of college pass-outs remain unemployed. the organisation tries to properly channelise the supply in the sector where there is a demand. however, frequent power cuts and poor internet connectivity in rural areas affect the productivity of the classrooms.why do urban learners usually secure better grades?performance trends reveal that urban learners always secure better grades than their rural counterparts. it is not calibre that affects their performance, but the resources and opportunities available to them. again, we cannot say that teaching is not a motivating profession. there are truly passionate teachers out there to make a difference. however, poor remuneration and inadequate training are discouraging.technology, on its part, has the potential to positively affect the quality of education, and also to break the digital divide plaguing our system.-- authored by beas dev ralhan, ceo and co-founder, next education india

2017-06-23,what makes a city smart in india and why world is far ahead of us,"the government has released a fresh list of 30 smart cities, taking the total number under the smart city mission to 90. these cities will be developed into smart cities. incidentally, none of the existing indian cities figure among the top cities of the world on any index.according to the iese business school cities in motion index 2017 , new york is the best city of the world to live in. it is followed by london and paris.the cities in motion analyses various aspects of 181 key cities of the world. mumbai is the top-ranking indian city at the 167th position followed by delhi at 174, bengaluru at 176 and kolkata at 179.the surveyors analysed 79 indicators across 10 different dimensions of urban life, namely economy, technology, human capital, social cohesion, international outreach, the environment, mobility and transportation, urban planning, public administration and governance.indian cities don't find themselves in the chart of top smart cities of the world. the chart shown below compares ranking of top cities on different indices, including that of the united nations.photo credit: cities in motion index 2017.what is a smart city?the concept of smart city originated with the smart planet initiative of ibm in 2008. as the concept gained currency, many countries including those in europe, china and south korea planned huge investment in the cities to prepare them for the future.a smart city is characterised by an urban region having modern technological infrastructure, access to smart energy, smart mobility, smart public utility services and ultra fast communication network.the smart city must not add to the already worrisome carbon problem of the world. the smart city benefits everybody - its residents, business persons and the government.why do we need smart cities?according to demographers, india will become the most-populous country in the world by 2030. unlike the previous phases of demographic change, the latest one is witnessing a fast shift towards urban areas, particularly the big cities.as per government estimates, every minute 25-30 people are migrating to major indian cities from rural areas in search of better livelihood and better lifestyles. if the pace of migration from rural areas to urban centres continues, indian cities would be home to nearly 85 crore people by 2050. this would make 70 per cent of the total population of the country.as the cities are generally considered the engines of economic growth, such a huge population in cities would be the biggest market in the world and may be the source of 80 per cent economic growth of the country.but such a huge population would also require accommodation, jobs, civic amenities, efficient governance, fast communication means, speedy and hassle-free transport system, uninterrupted and clean power, water supply and good quality of life.the smart city mission aims to provide the same to indians.what is being done?elaborating his government's vision about the smart city mission, prime minister narendra modi said, ""cities in the past were built on riverbanks. they are now built along highways. but in the future, they will be built based on the availability of optical fiber networks and next-generation infrastructure.""to develop 100 such smart cities for the future, the smart city mission requires an investment of about usd 1.2 trillion in the next 20 years.the smart city mission is being worked upon in close coordination with the projects like make in india and digital india.as per the make in india programme, a few smart cities are already coming up across the country such as kochi smart city, gujarat international finance tec-city (gift) in ahmedabad, naya raipur in chhattisgarh, lavasa in maharashtra and wave infratech's 4,500-acre smart city near new delhi.govt has also invited foreign partnershipthe government has also invited foreign partnership in developing smart cities. deals have been signed to develop three smart cities in association with germany, three with the united states, and one each with spain and singapore. japan has also agreed to invest usd 4.5 billion in the smart city mission.the industrial corridors, being developed to connect some of the mega cities, are further contributing to the smart city mission. the delhi-mumbai industrial corridor, the chennai-bangalore industrial corridor and the bangalore-mumbai economic corridor are expected to create smart cities in their sphere of influence.three smart cities such as ponneri in tamil nadu, krishnapatnam in andhra pradesh and tumkur in karnataka are being developed with the help of the japan international cooperation agency (jica), which has taken up the master plan for these cities.also read | new list of 30 smart cities is out. did your city make the cut?also read | 3 years of pm narendra modi: here's how nda government performed on economic frontalso watch video",0.1497278456837279,makes city smart india world far ahead us,"government released fresh list 30 smart cities , taking total number smart city mission 90. cities developed smart cities. incidentally , none existing indian cities figure among top cities world index.according iese business school cities motion index 2017 , new york best city world live in. followed london paris.the cities motion analyses various aspects 181 key cities world. mumbai top-ranking indian city 167th position followed delhi 174 , bengaluru 176 kolkata 179.the surveyors analysed 79 indicators across 10 different dimensions urban life , namely economy , technology , human capital , social cohesion , international outreach , environment , mobility transportation , urban planning , public administration governance.indian cities ' find chart top smart cities world. chart shown compares ranking top cities different indices , including united nations.photo credit : cities motion index 2017.what smart city?the concept smart city originated smart planet initiative ibm 2008. concept gained currency , many countries including europe , china south korea planned huge investment cities prepare future.a smart city characterised urban region modern technological infrastructure , access smart energy , smart mobility , smart public utility services ultra fast communication network.the smart city must add already worrisome carbon problem world. smart city benefits everybody -

2017-06-23,7 ways classroom teaching is better than online education,"now-a-days online coaching or tutoring has become a trend. while many educational institutions are going the virtual route, there are still many institutions who still realize the benefits of maintaining classroom teaching. research has proved that classroom teaching not only impacts the students but also the teachers.the following are the pro's of classroom teaching that digital or online education will find hard to replace:1. promotes collaborative learningbasically, classroom environment is essential to promote and stimulate collaborative learning. collaborative learning increases a student's self-awareness about how other students learn and enables them to learn more easily and effectively, transforming them into keen learners inside and beyond classroom.2. enhances critical thinking skillsit enhances students' critical thinking skills. teaching in a classroom gives students the opportunity to engage in live discussions in which they are forced to use their critical thinking skills to formulate opinions or arguments.3. improves social skillsinside a classroom, students experience social interactions with peers and establish rapport with teachers. helping children develop socially is an important aspect within the realm of their academic education.4. builds organisational skillsclassroom teaching teaches students how to develop organizational skills, beginning with the basics, such as arriving to school on time. in a live classroom, students are held accountable for being prepared to do school work, which includes having done their homework the night before, being ready for pop quizzes, turning in assignments by their due date and being prepared for in-class discussions. in effect, students learn how to organize their time, prioritize their assignments and get their homework done.5. keeps students stimulatedthe physical presence of a teacher keeps students stimulated through the interactive and interesting activities. this enables students to retain more from what they have learned during a session.6. teaching style can be modified according to the student's issuesteachers can modify their teaching style based on types of learners in their classroom i.e. classroom activities can help visual learner, interactions can help auditory learners, etc. teachers can get a clear idea whether students are following what has been taught or they require further explanation. at the same time, students can get their doubts clarified immediately before moving ahead in a topic. 7. develops important personality and career building skillsclassroom teaching inculcates conflict resolving skills, presentation skills when it comes to presenting their ideas confidently in front of peers, develops team spirit and teaches them to get along with those from different cultural backgrounds. such experiences are valuable in shaping students' communication and listening skills, as well as growing and maturing emotionally.these points show that though india is moving towards online education in large numbers due to the advent of digital india and increasing edutech popularity, classroom teaching has certain plus points that online teaching simply cannot replace.- authored by sudhanshu sinhal, managing director, sinhal classes pvt. ltd.read: 10 things every arts student is

2017-08-02,jio 4g could pose a threat to google's free wi-fi at railway stations,"the google railtel initiative, which was launched in january 2016 has to date reached 140 railway stations across india and claims to offer speeds ranging from 20-40mbps. a part of prime minister modi's digital india initiative, the main goal of this program is to bridge the digital divide and provide the masses with reliable and fast internet so that they can remain connected, do their work, watch videos and more while waiting for a train at railway stations.it is a great example of a public-private partnership - railtel, a subsidiary of the government of india provides the high speed internet network on fiber while google sets up the wireless infrastructure and provides tech support. they aim to reach 400 stations by the end of 2018.google's reasoning behind entering into a partnership with indian railways to bring high-speed internet at class a and a1 railway stations internet is both sound, forward thinking and intelligent. for google, this is an ecosystem project - the more people use the internet, the more they inadvertently use google services.however, in the timeframe between the start of the initiative and the present, the situation has changed dramatically. the railtel initiative started before jio revolutionised the telecom sector with its disruptive plans offering free voice calls and a gigabyte of 4g data a day. the biggest question now is has the shakeup of the telecom sector and the widespread and cheap availability of 4g data since the entry of jio affected the railtel initiative in any way?has jio 4g affected google's railtel initative?i had the opportunity to witness google's railtel initiative at nizamuddin railway station and see how the free wi-fi actually works, the speeds on offer and how it has affected people's lives. i also interviewed many workers and passengers at the station and asked them to share their experiences and purviews which led to some remarkable insights and observations.during my interaction with workers at the nizamuddin railway station which included coolies, those who manned the tea stalls and book shops and the guards, almost every one of them singularly said they preferred using their jio 4g sim over the free wi-fi available at the railway station.when prodded for a reason, the insights were fascinating. first - some facts. google's free wi-fi service works on a model where there is no cap on the volume of data consumed. however, there is a time-based cap on the speed of the network. how that works is a bit complicated - for the first 30 minutes, a user gets access to the highest speed of the network. in my experience, those were around 18-20mbps on average (pretty fantastic).workers at the station preferred using jio 4g over the free wi-fi due to network congestion in peak hours and the fact that speeds get throttled after 30 minuteshowever after the 30 minutes, there is no minimum speed as such. but the network is dynamically adjusted in such a way that priority is given to those who are logging in for the first time. in simpler words, the internet is configured in such a way that while you will still be able perform certain use cases after the high-speed cap gets over after 30 minutes, you will not get the highest speeds.that is basically why workers (who work for long hours at the railway station) prefer their jio 4g sims over the free wi-fi - because after 30 minutes, the speed gets throttled. what is fascinating is that not everyone seems to have same experience after the high-speed speed ends. some of the workers said that the speeds feel as bad as 128kbps while others said that they could stream decent quality video for 24 hours!also read: our wi-fi at indian railway stations is better than san francisco, london wi-fi: googlewhen i asked mr gulzar azad - google's head of connectivity if google's railtel strategy had changed in any way after jio's entry into the market, this is what he had to say - "" what we have seen is that as 4g has emerged, we have seen no dip in the wi-fi usage. if you talk about the time when 'free' 4g started emerging, we were at about 5 million (50 lakh) monthly active users, today we are at 6.5 million (65 lakh) monthly active users. so the railtel initiative has only grown since then.""however, we must take into account that the monthly active users has risen because the number of stations has risen quite a bit since the initiative started. in fact, since the beginning of the project, the time limit of the high-speed data has actually reduced from an hour to 30 minutes. this might be another reason why people are preferring to use jio 4g over the free wi-fi as the speeds get reduced after only 30 minutes of use.heavy traffic in peak hoursa common complaint that passengers waiting for trains and workers both had was that the server gets overloaded at peak hours. in the afternoon apparently the speed slows down because of heavy traffic, while at night it works very well. when i addressed this issue to mr gulzar azad, he said - "" this is exactly what we were expecting. once people start experiencing high-speed internet, the user behaviour changes - the expectation now is higher. there is more demand for less and less latency in the network.""a great initiative that needs to prepare for the futurehowever, the situation is not all doom and gloom. what i was surprised to note is that almost everyone at the platform that was engaged in their phones (that i approached) was connected to the free wi-fi. when asked about the method of connecting to the network, almost everybody was impressed with how easy and uncomplicated the process is.also, passengers waiting for a train (who, unlike workers are there for only short intervals of time) had little to complain about the initiative other than the fact that the otp sometimes takes a long time to appear. i also noticed a bunch of school boys using the wi-fi to send pictures of a textbook to their friends. this highlights the fact that the wi-fi is being used for more than just entertainment.almost everybody was impressed with how easy and uncomplicated the login process isall in all, google railtel is a great initiative by google to help connect the masses and help bridge the digital divide. more than just the numbers, the impact is growing as google expands from tier 1 to tier 2 towns. during the interaction, representatives from google and railtel stressed on how people in small cities were using the free wi-fi for work, to download textbooks and for much more productive causes.however, cheap 4g services from the likes of jio are a very real threat to the initiative and google needs to pull up its socks and prepare itself for the next rush of users. the time limit for high-speed data cannot be further reduced. in the future, the traffic will go up as awareness increases and the infrastructure will need to be buffed up accordingly.",0.20085705163291373,jio 4g could pose threat google ' free wi-fi railway stations,"google railtel initiative , launched january 2016 date reached 140 railway stations across india claims offer speeds ranging 20-40mbps. part prime minister modi ' digital india initiative , main goal program bridge digital divide provide masses reliable fast internet remain connected , work , watch videos waiting train railway stations.it great example public-private partnership -

2017-09-23,un general assembly session: sushma swaraj's full speech,"external affairs minister sushma swaraj, who addressed the 72nd sessionof united nations general assembly session in new york today, lambastedpakistan prime minister shahid khaqan abbasi for claiming that humanrights violations in areas of jammu and kashmir.swaraj furthersaid, ""we are completely engaged in fighting poverty, but our neighbourpakistan seems only engaged in fighting us.""here is the full speech:mr presidentlet me begin by offering my heartiest congratulations on your election aspresident of the 72nd united nations general assembly. for those of usfortunate to represent our nations as foreign minister this is aparticularly happy event: one of us has this honour.mr president2: india welcomes your efforts to place people at the heart ofinternational diplomacy as you shape policy and lend direction to worldaffairs from your august chair. i thank you for the theme you havechosen: 'focusing on people: striving for peace and a decent life on asustainable planet'. people, peace, decency, sustenance and focus define a noble objective.mr president3: the united nations was established for the welfare, security, harmony, rights and economicprogress of the people of our world. india fully supports your effortsin this great mission.4: i had spoken before this assembly lastyear as well. it is a year that has seen much change both in thisassembly and the world it represents. we have a new secretarygeneral at the united nations. he is determined to prepare andstrengthen the united nations to meet the challenges of the 21stcentury. we welcome his efforts, and see in him a leader who can givepractical shape to a vision.mr president5: ourcontemporary world is trapped in a deluge of troubles of which, surely,the most dangerous is the relentless rise of violence, terrorism, andthe ideas that engineer this evil, are spreading at the pace of aconflagration.climate change stares us in the face, and threatens us with its dimension.there is a growing question mark over maritime security. for a mix ofreasons, provocative and inflammatory, people are leaving thepsychological, cultural and economic comfort of their traditional homespace to seek refuge on distant shores causing global anxiety. a largepart of the globe's population is still tortured by hunger and poverty.the young are beginning to lose hope as they confront unemployment.women, victims of historic discrimination, are demanding what they mustget: gender empowerment.nuclear proliferation is back in the zone of dangerous headlines. cyber security has become a source of deep insecurity.6: in 2015, we set ourselves a target of 2030 to find solutions to manychallenges on this agenda. two of these years have already passed.surely it is already time to ask how much has happened. if complacencydefmes the next 13 years then we are in danger of losing control. weneed a sense of urgency as well as unshakeable fortitude to takedecisions that can avert catastrophe.7: i am pleased that indiahas displayed the courage and leadership to take tough decisions whichhave launched the interlinked process of sustainable development. thecomplete eradication of poverty is the most important priority of thepresent government. mr president, there are two ways of addressing thecurse of poverty. the traditional method is through incremental levelsof aid and hand-holding. but our prime minister narendra modi has chosenthe more radical route, through economic empowerment. the poor are nothelpless: we have merely deemed them opportunity. we are eliminating poverty by investing in the poor. we are turning them from job-seekers into job-providers.8: all our economic programmes have a principal purpose, die empowermentof the poor; jan dhan, mudra, ujjwala, skill india, digital india, clean india, start-up india, stand-up india. to describe them all would takeup more time than 1have at my disposal, and i shall therefore dwell on only three core programmes.9: the jan dhan plan must surely count as the world's largest financialinclusion scheme. at least 300 million indians who had never crossed the doors of a bank today have bank accounts; this is equivalent to thepopulation of the united states of america. this was, understandably,not easy to complete in three years, but our banks, achieved thisvisionary goal set by our prime minister. while some remain to beincluded, the target has been set - every indian family will have a bank account.10: mudra yojana has enabled government to fund theunfunded. those who had never dreamt that bank credit was within theiroptions, today, through mudra, are getting soft loans without collateralto begin micro businesses. i am particularly delighted to inform youthat over 70 per cent of these loans have gone to women. unemploymentspreads despair. through skill india, start-up india and stand-up indiapoor and middle class youth are being trained to match their honedtalent with bank credit and become self-employed or small-scaleentrepreneurs.11: ujjwala is a signature scheme of ourgovernment. free gas cylinders are being provided to the poor so thatwomen do not have to suffer the dangerous consequences of wood-fired kitchens. uniquely, gender emancipation is at the creative core of this programme.12: demonetisation was a courageous decision to challenge one of the byproducts of corruption, the ""black money"" that disappeared fromcirculation. today, india has passed the goods and services taxlegislation, through which there is one-tax across the country, withoutthe untidy and punishing system of multiple taxes under differingcategories in different parts of the country. our ""save the girl,educate the girl"" campaign is reducing gender inequality. our cleanindia programme is generating what can only be described as arevolutionary change in social attitudes and habits.13: i wouldlike to note, at this point, that nations with rising capabilities will be able to generate such change, but the developed world must becomean active partner in helping those vulnerable countries which are stillmired in stagnant poverty reach sdg horizon within 2030. that is why the principle of global partnership was included in sdgs. i am happy toreport that india has started, this year, the india-un developmentpartnership fund.mr president14: we are completelyengaged in fighting poverty; alas, our neighbour pakistan seems onlyengaged in fighting us. on thursday, from this dais, pakistan's primeminister shahid khakan abbasi wasted rather too much of his speech inmaking accusations against us. he accused india of state-sponsoredterrorism, and of violating human rights. those listening had only oneobservation: ""look who's talking!"" a country that has been the world'sgreatest exporter of havoc, death and inhumanity became a champion of hypocrisy by preaching about humanity from this podium.15: pakistan's prime minister claimed that his nation's founder mohammad ali jinnah had bequeathed a foreign policy based on peace and friendship. i would like to remind him that while it remains open to question whether jinnah sahab actually advocated such principles, what is beyond doubtis that india's prime minister narendra modi has, from the moment hetook his oath of office, offered the hand of peace, and friendship.pakistan's prime minister must answer why his nation spurned this offer.16: prime minister abbasi has recalled old resolutions that have been longovertaken by events. but his memory has conveniently failed him where it matters. he has forgotten that under the shimla agreement and thelahore declaration india and pakistan resolved that they would settleall outstanding issues bilaterally. the reality is that pakistan'spoliticians remember everything, manipulate memory into a convenience.they are masters at ""forgetting"" facts that destroy their version.17: pakistan's current prime minister spoke of a ""comprehensive dialogue""between our two countries. i would like to remind him that on 9 december 2015, when i was in islamabad for the heart of asia conference, adecision was made by his leader mian nawaz sharif, then still primeminister, that dialogue between us should be renewed and named it a""comprehensive bilateral dialogue"". the word ""bilateral"" was usedconsciously to remove any confusion or doubt about the fact that theproposed talks would be between our two nations and only between our two nations, without any third-party present. and he must answer why thatproposal withered, because pakistan is responsible for the aborting that peace process.18: i would like today to tell pakistan'spoliticians just this much, that perhaps the wisest thing they could dois to look within. india and pakistan became free within hours of eachother. why is it that today india is a recognised it superpower in theworld, and pakistan is recognised only as the pre-eihinent exportfactory for terror?19: india has risen despite being theprincipal destination of pakistan s nefarious export of terrorism. there have been many governments under many parties during 70 years of indian freedom, for we have been a sustained democracy. every government hasdone its bit for india's development. we have marched ahead,consistently, without pause, in education, health and across the rangeof human welfare. we established scientific and technical institutionswhich are the pride of the world. but what has pakistan offered to theworld and indeed to its own people apart from terrorism? we producedscholars, doctors, engineers. what have you produced? you have producedterrorists. doctors save people from death; terrorists send them todeath. if pakistan had spent on its development what it has spent ondeveloping terror, both pakistan and the world would be safer andbetter-off today.mr. president20: terrorism is at the very top of problems for which the united nations is searching forsolutions. we have been the oldest victims of this terrible and eventraumatic terrorism. when we began articulating about this menace, manyof the world's big powers.dismissed this as a law and order issue. nowthey know better. the question is: what do we do about it?21: we must all introspect and ask ourselves whether our talk is anywhereclose to the action we take. we all condemn this evil, and piouslyresolve to fight it in all our declaratory statements. the truth is that these have become rituals. the fact is that when we are required tofight and destroy this enemy, the self-interest of some leads them,towards duplicity.22: this has been going on for years.although india proposed a comprehensive convention on internationalterrorism (ccit) as early as in 1996, yet two decades later the unitednations has not been able to agree upon a definition of terrorism. if we cannot agree to define our enemy, how can we fight together? if wecontinue to differentiate between good terrorists and bad terrorists,how can we fight together? if even the united nations security councilcannot agree on the listing of terrorists, how can we fight together?mr president23: through you, with utmost sincerity i would like to request this august assembly to stop seeing this evil with self-defeating and indeedmeaningless nuance. evil is evil. let us accept that terrorism is anexistentialist danger to humankind. there is absolutely no justification for this barbaric violence. let us display our new commitment byreaching agreement on the comprehensive convention on internationalterrorism this year itself.mr president24: i hadidentified climate change as one of the significant dangers to ourexistence. india has already said that it is deeply committed to theparis accord. this is not because we are afraid of any power, influenced by friend or foe, or tempted by some imagined greed. this is an outcome of a philosophy that is at least 5000 years old. our prime ministerhas, on his personal initiative, launched the international solaralliance as witness to our abiding commitment to a cause.25: when we talk of. world peace, we mean peace not only among,human beingsbut also peace with nature. we understand that human nature is sometimes inimical to nature, but we would like to amend human nature when ittends in the. wrong, directions. when we inflict our greed upon nature,nature sometimes explodes. we must learn to have with the imperatives,cycles and creative urges of nature; in that lies, our own salvation.26: we have just witnessed hurricanes, earthquakes, rains that inundate,storms which terrify. this is not a mere coincidence. nature sent,itswarning to the world even before the world's leadership gathered in newyork at the united nations through harvey. once our gathering began anearthquake struck mexico and a hurricane landed in domimca. we mustunderstand this requires more serious action than talk. the developedworld must listen more carefully than others, because it has morecapacities than others. it must help the less fortunate throughtechnology transfer and green climate financing - that is the only way tosave future generations.mr president27: we arediscussing turbulence and change across the world, but the oneorganisation created to address world affairs is beset by its ownproblems. it seems to believe that it can afford not to change from theprecepts and perceptions that determined its birth. on 18 september,there was a meeting here on un reform. i participated. i witnessed anevident desire for change, to do. something. but i do want to remind you that at the 2005 world summit there was a consensus that the earlyreform of the security council is an essential element of our overalleffort to reform the united nations.28: efforts at text-basednegotiations on the reform and expansion of the security council wereinitiated in the last session and more than 160 nations had expressedsupport for this effort. if we are serious, then the least we can do isproduce one text that can be the basis for negotiation. i hope thatunder your enlightened leadership, mr president, this will become apriority. if that happens it will be a significant achievement.29: we also have high expectations from the new secretary general of theunited nations. if he wants to reform the peace and securityarchitecture, he will also need to address reforms related topeacekeeping that have been urged for long. without improvements in unpeacekeeping this goal can't be achieved.mr president30: there is no shortage of issues; there is even less shortage of problems which should be recognised from this podium. but time is not always onthe side of those who would like to raise issues and problems in theinterests of a better, more peaceful and progressive future. the issuesyou have chosen are relevant to the un charter as well as to the ancient traditions of my land.mr president31: my country'sculture and thought has been shaped by a history and philosophy thatbelieves in peace as humankind's only rational and practical objective.we truly believe that the world is one family and we hope that everymember of this family deserves that elixir of life, happiness.let me end by reciting a verse that is a synthesis of thought:may all be happy; may all be healthy; may all see what is good; may a be free from suffering.thank you,mr. president.",0.06060776476420648,un general assembly session : sushma swaraj ' full speech,"external affairs minister sushma swaraj , addressed 72nd sessionof united nations general assembly session new york today , lambastedpakistan prime minister shahid khaqan abbasi claiming humanrights violations areas jammu kashmir.swaraj furthersaid , "" completely engaged fighting poverty , neighbourpakistan seems engaged fighting us.
