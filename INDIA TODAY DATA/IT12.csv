34 per cent, 33 per cent and 31 per cent respectively. however, the divide lines within the bloc get sharper depending on community allegiance.analysing the voting pattern for 2008 karnataka assembly election, the study found that 51 per cent of lingayat votes went to the bjp led by bs yeddiyurappa in the state. yeddiyurappa hails from the lingayat community which has been recently accorded by the congress government of siddaramaiah the status of a separate religion distinct from hinduism. the congress had secured only 25 per cent votes from the lingayat community while the jds got 15 per cent.upper caste voters prefer the bjp (41 per cent) to the congress (33 per cent) and the jd(s) 13 per cent. the jd(s) led by hd deve gowda received 40 per cent of vokkaliga votes. deve gowda belongs to the community. the congress got 35 per cent vokkaliga votes while the bjp got only 18 per cent favour from the community.in the case of lower social bloc votes, the congress secured 54 per cent votes followed by the bjp and the jd(s) with both getting 18 per cent each. as many as 38 per cent lower obc votes favoured the congress. the bjp (29 per cent) and the jd(s) - 20 per cent - came next.dalits, adivasis and muslims overwhelmingly voted for the congress - 50 per cent, 44 per cent and 65 per cent respectively. the bjp's share among dalit votes was only 20 per cent and among the adivasis, it was 25 per cent. only 11 per cent muslim voters favoured the bjp.caste and karnatakathis pattern of voting is believed to have remained the same in all the elections held over the last decade. chief minister siddaramaiah is eying to change this politico-electoral alignment of castes with his social engineering - ahinda campaign when the state votes to elect the next government on may 12.majority of karnataka chief ministers since 1952 have belonged to either lingayat or vokkalinga community based on the perception that they are the most dominant political force in the state. with his ahinda (acronym for alpa sankhyatara, hindulida, dalit or minorities, backward castes and dalits) campaign, siddaramaiah has tried to change the way castes have been casting their votes in karnataka.siddaramaiah commissioned a caste census at the cost of rs 150 crore in 2015. the reports have not been officially made public but according to what seems like a tactical leak of the caste census data, the share of lingayats in karnataka's population has come down from around 16-17 per cent to 9.8 per cent.in the case of vokkaliga, the proportion in state's population came down from around 14-15 per cent to just over 8 per cent. according to caste census of 2015, the dalits form the single biggest community in karnataka. they account for 24 per cent of 6.5 crore population of the state.muslims constitute about 12.5 per cent of karnataka's population while scheduled tribes and kurubas (the community to which chief minister siddaramaiah belongs to) have a share of 7 per cent each. the brahmins comprise only two per cent of the state's population. this also means that about 80 per cent of karnataka's population belongs to ahinda (minorities, obcs, scs and sts).caste wooing in karnatakathe new ""leaked"" data have forced all the political parties to realign their electoral calculations ahead of voting in the karnataka assembly election. siddaramaiah is trying to win over lingayats by acceding to their demand for recognition as a distinct religious group from hindu.besides, siddaramaiah has got himself described as ahinda chief minister in order to woo the communities which are believed to be ""not inclined"" towards the bjp. on the other hand, the bjp is trying to reach out to communities that are believed to be in the folds of the jd(s) or the congress.bjp president amit shah has met priests of adichunchanagiri - the spiritual headquarters of the vokkaliga, who have voted largely for either the congress or the jd(s). vokkaligas were said to be outraged following income tax raids at the properties of karnataka energy minister dk shivakumar. amit shah's visit was also aimed at pacifying the community.at the same time, both shah and prime minister narendra modi have projected yeddiyurappa as the chief ministerial candidate despite him having crossed the unofficial retirement age of 75 years. this seems to be an attempt to keep the lingayats behind the party in the karnataka assembly election.the bjp is also playing down the differences between yeddiyurappa and ks eshwarappa, a powerful leader from obc community. eshwarappa is the leader of opposition in the karnataka legislative council. the bjp's outreach to the obcs is likely to get limited success given the open rivalry between yeddiyurappa, the cm candidate of the party and eshwarappa.the jd(s), on its part, has stitched an alliance with mayawati's bsp in karnataka to attract dalit voters, who have now emerged as the most dominant ""vote bank"". it also hopes to keep its support base among vokkaligas intact.with all three dominant parties giving weightage to new caste data in karnataka, attempts are afloat for fresh community alignments. the old brahmins-lingayats, scheduled caste-scheduled tribes, obc and muslims formulae are set to go for a toss in the karnataka assembly election 2018.",0.05200959171547406,karnataka election 2018 : siddaramaiah win congress beating modi-shah duo ahinda campaign ?,"per one study done centre studies developing societies ( csds ) , upper social bloc votes almost equally distributed among congress , bjp jd( ) karnataka -

2018-05-05,narendra modi will be prime minister again in 2019: ram vilas paswan to india today,"ram vilas paswan is one of the most prominent dalit faces in politics. over decades he has carved a special place for himself in bihar and national politics. the chief of lok jan shakti party and union minister for consumer affairs thinks that the work done in india since independence will not measure up to what pm modi has achieved. speaking at aaj tak's 'seedhi baat', paswan said that narendra modi will be the prime minister yet again in 2019.when asked about dalit outrage in recent times, paswan said that there is stark difference between him and the generation of his son chirag paswan. according to paswan, people of his generation tolerated severe abuse and oppression, however, today's generation strives to live with dignity. he said that there would not have been any delay in filing a review petition in the dalit act case if the law ministry was a proactive.when paswan, who is the sitting lok sabha mp from hajipur in bihar, was asked about lalu yadav calling him the weather vane of indian politics, he said, ""i have already said that there is no vacancy for 2019. the opposition is working hard, but there will be no returns. modi ji will again become the prime minister. there will be a majority nda government.""paswan is confident of a second nda government coming to power on the basis of the work it has done.he said, ""modi government has achieved a lot since independence. if you measure the work of this government against what had been achieved before it, modi's government would have the scales tilted in its favour. modi means work. if you consider that someone visits five countries in three days, spends half of his time abroad then how can you compare his dedication to someone else, nobody would come up to his standards.""dalit angeron the question of the anger among dalits, he said, ""dalit anger is natural. they can break, but are not open to the idea of bowing down. post-independence the ideals of baba saheb ambedkar took roots. and what the narendra modi government has done for baba saheb ambedkar, i do not think that any other government could have managed to do.""when asked about naming of projects, statues of ambedkar, the lok sabha mp said, ""earlier there only few from the scheduled castes had bank accounts, but under the jan dhan yojana many have bank accounts now. some 1.5 lakh bank branches have been asked to help facilitate business for dalits under the mudra yojana, dicci (dalit indian chamber of commerce & industry) has been formed on the lines of ficci, all these are initiatives for the poor, the downtrodden.""upon being asked why dalits were angry despite the welfare schemes? paswan replied saying, ""there are two main causes. we are not able to put forth our point of view, our achievements to the people. as the dalits are still severely backward, they need to be convinced repeatedly that we stand with them. for example, incidents took place in una and jhajjhar. five dalits were burnt alive near the jhajjar thana. the government took immediate action in the una case, the chief minister was removed, 36 officers were suspended. action was taken, but we are somehow unable to convey this to our people properly, and as a result a wrong impression has been created.""sc/st actwhen asked why he was silent on these issues as a representative of the government, paswan said, ""as far as the dalit act is concerned, i was the minister when the vp singh government was in power in 1989. there were some 22 points, which were defined as offences. when the narendra modi government came to power the 22 points were expanded to 47 points through a bill passed on january 26, 2016. the matter was taken to court. the law stated that fir will be followed by arrest. they said that the accused will have the right to seek anticipatory bail. to begin with, senior officials will conduct an inquiry on the charges. however, we had formulated this based on article 15 (4) of the constitution which allows the state to make any special provision for the advancement of any socially and educationally backward classes of citizens or for the scheduled castes and the scheduled tribes.""on the delay of filing review petition, paswan said, ""if the court ruled that there would be no immediate imprisonment, why was the anger directed at our government. the anger was against the judgment. even we were disappointed, that is why chirag paswan immediately filed a review petition on behalf of our party. when we met the prime minister he said that we will file a review petition. meanwhile, there was a vacation of six days, but i will agree that if the law ministry and the department were a bit proactive instead of pushing files or if they would have asked every stakeholder to sit down together, they could have taken a decision, as the government had already decided on it.""he further added, ""the court's judgment is not in our hands. but, we would like to declare, on behalf of the government, as the pm had appointed a high-powered committee, we have taken this decision. the court should seriously consider the issue and even then if it does not happen, we will bring the ordinance.""dining at dalit homesdo you think the dalit anger against the government is justified? on this issue paswan said, ""this anger was not against the government. the government did its job. the government made the law tougher. but supreme court diluted that act. so, the anger was against the judgment.""on the question related to leaders dining at dalit households, paswan said, ""anybody can dine anywhere, to say that i dine at dalit homes is not the correct way. in my constituency, i visit homes of brahmins, rajputs, dalits. mostly i visit dalit households, but what is the need for publicity.""new utensils, outside food, do you feel that these things damage the image? on this paswan said, ""why do you go uninvited, if someone invites you for dinner, go and have it. but, if somebody carries outside food just to show that i am having food at your place, this is wrong. there are many types of people; probably they must have thought that the media have not noticed from where they got the food.""on people from the upper castes seeking reservation, he said ""from the day our party was formed in 2000, we have been demanding 15 per cent reservation for upper caste poor. we suggested inter caste marriages as means of ending the evils of the caste system. we have been demanding 15 per cent reservation from the very first.""will you be a part of the nda in 2019, you have spoken about the need for bjp to take along its partners? on this question paswan said, ""absolutely, we will be part of the nda. my son chirag paswan spoke about the need for taking along partners. we are followers of baba saheb ambedkar. baba saheb have spoken about honourable co-existence.""do you see rahul gandhi as an alternative? on this question paswan said, ""there is no personal enmity with anyone, but political differences do exist.""according to paswan, rahul gandhis meeting with lalu yadav in hospital was mere vote bank politics.you can watch the full interview of ram vilas paswan in 'seedhi baat' at 8 pm on sunday. also read: karnataka election: is yeddyurappa pm modi's safety valve for 2019 lok sabha polls?why rahul gandhi's prediction of narendra modi losing election from varanasi is not convincing",-0.06969308469308469,narendra modi prime minister 2019 : ram vilas paswan india today,"ram vilas paswan one prominent dalit faces politics. decades carved special place bihar national politics. chief lok jan shakti party union minister consumer affairs thinks work done india since independence measure pm modi achieved. speaking aaj tak ' ' seedhi baat ' , paswan said narendra modi prime minister yet 2019.when asked dalit outrage recent times , paswan said stark difference generation son chirag paswan. according paswan , people generation tolerated severe abuse oppression , however , today ' generation strives live dignity. said would delay filing review petition dalit act case law ministry proactive.when paswan , sitting lok sabha mp hajipur bihar , asked lalu yadav calling weather vane indian politics , said , "" already said vacancy 2019. opposition working hard , returns. modi ji become prime minister. majority nda government.

2018-05-10,karnataka election campaign: who will heal the divided house?,"it was in 1960 that the legendary filmmaker bimal roy made parakh. written by salil chowdhury, parakh is a satirical gem on india's politics in the nehru era. the plot of the movie revolves around a postmaster, who gets a cheque for rs 5 lakh, which is supposed to be given to the most suitable candidate in the village, who would use it for people's welfare. the postmaster, played by nasir hussain, decides to hold an election. what ensues is a classic case study of how low politics can touch. fifty-eight years later, india's politics has barely changed. bimal roy's classic remains relevant today as ever before.this is 2018. we are in a different century and post offices are barely used today but little has changed in india's villages when it comes to poverty, caste divide and access to basic amenities. politicians of all hues can still fan religious passion among innocent villagers making them mere pawns in the game of power.the high-octane and verbally charged election campaigns over several decades have left the state and society divided. the level of the attack and counter-attack in today's electoral politics is turning vicious day-by-day. we barely see political leaders just debate on the issues related to development. karnataka assembly election campaign was no different.top leaders including prime minister narendra modi and congress president rahul gandhi have engaged in war-of-words not limited to the political questions only. both pm modi and rahul gandhi have not hesitated in hurling personal innuendos at one another to score a brownie point in karnataka election.our leaders seem to conveniently forget that when the elections are over, the society has to work in harmony again. on may 15, when the karnataka assembly election 2018 results are announced, we will come to know who the winner is. but like most of the elections in the country, the majority will end up on the losing side. a party which bags close to 40 per cent of the total votes polled is likely to emerge the winner but that leaves another set of people who will feel left out.what adds to our worry is not how charged-up the election campaigns have become but a dearth of leaders who seem willing to bridge the divide that politics creates during election campaigns. this is not happening only in karnataka but it has become a worry across the country. the neighbouring countries which draw inspiration from the world's largest democracy seem to be falling in the same trap. where are the leaders who can work across the aisle to put the interests of society above party politics?every election leaves our society more disintegrated. with passions flying high, especially social media, where people block or unfriend someone for political differences, the divide gets deeper.former prime minister atal bihari vajpayee, in one of his most quoted speeches, said, ""rajniti mein matbhed rakhiye, manbhed nahi (have differences of opinion not personal animosity in politics).""we often end up papering over the differences. it is time as a country we rise and take a smarter approach to rebuild the social fabric and restore the trust which has taken a hit because of the decline in political discourse today. it's not just the politicians who are to be blamed for the polarisation that we see today, often the media also gets carried away with symbolic skirmishes instead of focusing on the issues that impact daily life of people.that brings us to the next question. are we willing to work together and look to resolve issues relating to quality of education, reach of electricity, healthcare, development projects, environmental concerns, neglect of elders, alcoholism, over-exploitation of natural resources, suicide by farmers, hunger and shelter when the elections get over? will pm modi and rahul gandhi come together to address the problems of the state after a government is formed?political one-upmanship often comes in the way of rebuilding process and the masses end up at the receiving end. in bimal roy's parakh, the village postmaster was caught in financial troubles - a loan, terminally ill wife and a daughter who he wished to marry off to a person who would respect and love his daughter. all this with little resource and help from society as whole. sadly, from nehru to modi, the condition in indian villages has largely remained the same.the lethargic pace at which india has progressed in the past seven decades is often cited as the biggest drawback against the democratic form of governance. the authoritarian alternative elsewhere in the world is no better model to substitute democracy.we cannot agree more with former prime minister of britain winston churchill, who once said, ""the best argument against democracy is a five-minute conversation with the average voter.""indian politics and society need leaders who can resist the temptation of turning diversity into divide and unify different segments of society despite their inherent differences.also read: siddaramaiah will lose in both chamundeshwari and badami, says amit shahalso read: rahul gandhi as pm candidate may put third front in a fixwatch: 'kaamdaar' modi dares 'naamdaar' rahul to speak 15 minutes on karnataka govt's achievements",0.06965053763440861,karnataka election campaign : heal divided house ?,"1960 legendary filmmaker bimal roy made parakh. written salil chowdhury , parakh satirical gem india ' politics nehru era. plot movie revolves around postmaster , gets cheque rs 5 lakh , supposed given suitable candidate village , would use people ' welfare. postmaster , played nasir hussain , decides hold election. ensues classic case study low politics touch. fifty-eight years later , india ' politics barely changed. bimal roy ' classic remains relevant today ever before.this 2018. different century post offices barely used today little changed india ' villages comes poverty , caste divide access basic amenities. politicians hues still fan religious passion among innocent villagers making mere pawns game power.the high-octane verbally charged election campaigns several decades left state society divided. level attack counter-attack today ' electoral politics turning vicious day-by-day. barely see political leaders debate issues related development. karnataka assembly election campaign different.top leaders including prime minister narendra modi congress president rahul gandhi engaged war-of-words limited political questions only. pm modi rahul gandhi hesitated hurling personal innuendos one another score brownie point karnataka election.our leaders seem conveniently forget elections , society work harmony again. may 15 , karnataka assembly election 2018 results announced , come know winner is. like elections country , majority end losing side. party bags close 40 per cent total votes polled likely emerge winner leaves another set people feel left out.what adds worry charged-up election campaigns become dearth leaders seem willing bridge divide politics creates election campaigns. happening karnataka become worry across country. neighbouring countries draw inspiration world ' largest democracy seem falling trap. leaders work across aisle put interests society party politics?every election leaves society disintegrated. passions flying high , especially social media , people block unfriend someone political differences , divide gets deeper.former prime minister atal bihari vajpayee , one quoted speeches , said , "" rajniti mein matbhed rakhiye , manbhed nahi ( differences opinion personal animosity politics ) .

2018-05-12,karnataka election 2018: biggest takeaways from india today-axis my india exit poll,"the indian national congress is expected to emerge as the single-largest party in the karnataka and could even form the next government single-handedly, the india today-axis my india exit poll has predicted.the party is expected to win between 106 and 118 seats in the 224-seat assembly (the exit poll prediction are only for 222 seats since polling in two constituencies has been postponed). the halfway mark in the assembly is 112.the bharatiya janata party (bjp), which is hoping to steal the congress's southern bastion to get an advantage ahead of next year's lok sabha election, is expected to win between 79 and 92 seats while the janata dal (secular) and its allies could win 22-30 seats.here are some of the biggest takeaways from the india today-axis my india exit poll: 2018 vs 2013: based on the 2013 karnataka election actual numbers and the india today-axis my india projections, the congress is losing seats while the bjp would gain on its 2013 seat tally. in 2013, the congress had won 122 seats while the bjp had won 40. but, it must be noted that yedyurappa had rebelled against the bjp in 2013 and had floated his own party to contest that election. no anti-incumbency: there is almost no anti-incumbency factor noticed, according to the findings of the exit poll. incumbent chief minister siddaramaiah enjoys overall popularity in relative terms, given the cloud of concerns around the bjp cm candidate yeddyurappa. however, the concerns over yeddyurappa have been countered to a large extent by prime minister narendra modi's campaigning.caste consolidation: according to the india today-axis my india poll, the congress enjoys the support of minorities (muslims and christians), kurubas and scs/sts, which constitute 48 per cent of karnataka's population. bjp enjoys the support of lingayats, brahmins, jains, obcs, kshatriyas and marathis, constituting 41 per cent of the population.region-wise trends: coastal karnataka, central karnataka and bombay karnataka are with the bjp. hyderabad, old mysore and bangalore city are with the congress. however, in old mysore, vokkaliga-dominated seats are with the jds. bjp's conundrum: according to the india today-axis my india exit poll, the bjp and the congress face a straight fight in 170 seats. in the other 52 seats, the fight is between the congress and the jd(s). this means that for the bjp to attain a majority mark in the karnataka assembly, the party must win 70 per cent of its battles against congress in the 170 seats. this is an uphill task.follow our coverage of the karnataka assembly election 2018 herealso read: expected this, says siddaramaiah after india today exit poll predicts

2018-05-15,secrets of bjp's success in karnataka assembly election,"the bjp has surprised many poll pundits who predicted the congress as the single-largest party and a hung assembly making the jd (s) a mighty kingmaker. but the bjp looks all set to form the next government in karnataka, in all probability, on its own.the secrets of the bjp's performance in karnataka lie in three regions of the state. these are bombay karnataka, coastal karnataka and central karnataka. the party has also done reasonably well in hyderabad karnataka.bombay karnatakathe congress had performed exceptionally well in this lingayat dominated region of karnataka. the party had won 30 seats in the region while the bjp got 15 seats. current tally was 31 and 13 for the congress and the bjp from bombay karnataka. the jd (s) won just one.this time, the bjp has improved its tally from 13 to 30 while the congress has suffered a loss of 14 -- from 31 to 17. the jd (s) has marginally improved from one to two seats. others have four seats in bombay karnataka.bombay karnataka comprises of districts that were carved out from the former state of bombay -- bijapur, bagalkot, belgaum, dharwad, gadag and haveri -- and has 50 assembly seats.in 2014, the bjp secured 51 per cent of votes against 43 per cent of the congress. the bjp was leading in 39 assembly segments in 2014 while the congress was ahead in 11.coastal karnatakacoastal karnataka has three districts -- uttar kannada, udupi and dakshin kannada -- having direct access to the arabian sea sending 19 legislators to karnataka assembly. in 2013, the congress secured 13 seats and 43 per cent votes in coastal karnataka while the bjp won only three seats with 34 per cent vote share.the bjp has swept coastal karnataka this time winning 16 of 19 seats. the congress has suffered a loss of 10 seats in a region having sizeable population of christians and muslims. this was also the region where the bjp's firebrand leader and uttar pradesh chief minister yogi adityanath addressed quite a few rallies in here.the karnataka assembly election results in coastal karnataka are consistent with the voting pattern in the lok sabha polls in 2014. the bjp had then polled 55 per cent votes in coastal karnataka and was leading in 17 of the 19 constituencies.central karnatakathe four districts of shimoga (bjp's chief ministerial candidate bs yeddyurappa's home turf), chikmagalur, davangere and chitradurga form the central karnataka region having 26 seats. the bjp has won 20 seats in the region with the congress winning the rest six. the jd (s) failed to secure a seat here.in 2013, the congress had won 15 seats followed by the jd (s) which got six seats. the bjp had to content with only four victories in central karnataka. this region has strong presence of veershaivas and lingayats. the bjp's success in central karnataka is a signal that chief minister siddaramaiah's move to grant minority status to lingayats failed to split the community vote.hyderabad karnatakathis is another region that seems to have worked for the bjp in karnataka assembly election even though the congress has fared better in hyderabad karnataka. of the 40 assembly seats in hyderabad karnataka, the bjp has secured 16 seats against its last election's tally of 7.the congress, on the other hand, has not done badly winning 21 seats. its last election's tally was 23 in hyderabad karnataka. but, with the bjp winning more than double its previous tally, the party emerged single-largest in karnataka assembly this time.hyderabad karnataka comprises of the districts that were once part of the princely state of hyderabad. these districts -- bidar, gulbarg, yadgir, raichur and koppal -- have 40 assembly segments. the region has sizeable population of the lingayats and obcs. the re-entry of yeddyurappa, reddy brothers and b sreeramulu in the bjp seems to have worked in bjp's favour here.the bjp was leading in 23 of 40 assembly constituencies in hyderabad karnataka in 2014 lok sabha elections. the congress was ahead in 17 seats.the restthe saffron party has also improved its performance in old mysore region where the bjp improved its tally from two to 11. the bjp has almost repeated its performance in bengaluru regions. it won 11 seats this time same as 2013.in all, the bjp won 104 seats in karnataka assembly election, falling eight short of majority mark. voting was held on 222 of 224 karnataka assembly seats. polling for the rr nagar seat was deferred to may 28 following complaints of electoral malpractices while election was cancelled at jayanagar seat after the bjp candidate here died.follow our live blog, or watch live tv coverage in english and hindi to keep abreast of the latest updates. also visit our special

2018-05-17,karnataka power tussle in supreme court today: options before the court,"after the high octane drama that unfolded last night with a midnight hearing, the top court had refused to stay the swearing-in of bs yeddyurappa as new karnataka cm. but, the supreme court also said that the oath administered to the cm is subject to further orders by the apex court.the court also demanded the submission of letters dated may 15 and may 16 which were written to the governor by the bjp.further, the 15-day time period granted to the bjp to prove majority on the floor of the house remains open to challenge and is likely to be a hot point of argument during the hearing on friday.bjp's bs yeddyurappa has been sworn in as the new karnataka chief minister and while one may criticise any political party for unethical behaviour, not every immoral act is illegal.here are the legal options and possible scenarios ahead of the apex court hearing on may 18.names or no names? the supreme court has demanded the submission of letters that find mention in the communication with the governor. there is still no clarity on the content of these letters.while the order uses the word ""letters"", the oral observation of justice sikri to attorney general was ""you show us the list"".while the order was being dictated, abhishek manu singhvi arguing for congress said that he specifically wants the names of those who support and ""not vaguely like two independents"".it is unlikely that the attorney general will submit any specific names because submitting these names to the supreme court will be a brazen political argument in a court of law.also read: blow-by-blow account of the midnight drama in sc over yeddyurappa's swearing-insince there are only three parties with no independents, the question is how will the bjp muster up the number without being caught on the wrong side of anti-defection law?attorney general venugopal went on to say that anti-defection applies only post swearing-in.while this may be a perfectly sound legal point but it shows how political opportunism brazens out due process and breaches the trust that the constitution has reposed in the political class.will the government actually say it on oath to the supreme court that they shall rely on abstentions and defections from the congress or the jd(s)?the governor can also refuse to be a part of the proceedings citing his privilege and protection under article 163 which grants a limited discretionary power to him along with immunity from any court proceedings. it will be a bold argument for the executive to make before the apex court and refuse to give any list.no precedent or law to compel governor neither the bommai (1994) judgment nor the verdict of supreme court in the case of nabam rebia (2014) pertaining to arunachal pradesh sets any precedent on how the governor should exercise his discretion while appointing a government.article 163, 164 grant powers to the governor to act according to his discretion while appointing a chief minister and a council of ministers.both, bommai judgment and nabam rebia judgment, are an extensive authority on the relations of the centre and state, and how should the president exercise his special powers. the nabam rebia judgment lays down that the governors must act in a non-partisan manner, but this proposition has not been developed by legal authority or any constitution bench judgment with respect to formation of the government.also read: congress-jd (s) petition did not merit a midnight hearing: mukul rohatgiif the governor through the attorney general refuses to share names or details of people who are supporting the bjp, the apex court cannot compel. they can call for a constitution bench or pass a verbally scathing order but to actually annul swearing-in of a cm because he could not show names to the supreme court is not permissible under the present law.reduce the time of 15 daysthat's the only remedy that the courts have devised so far when matters of poaching or alleged abuse of power by governors have emerged.in many cases, the latest being goa, the apex court asked the floor test to be done within 48 hours in a bid to avoid horse-trading or poaching of mlas. the congress team backed by top lawyers is cognizant of the fact reducing the 15-day time period is the only tangible result that they can legally achieve.defection doesn't lead to disqualificationthe most crucial point here is that while a legislator can lose his membership on defection (according to tenth schedule of the indian constitution), it does not bar a legislator from re-contesting.defection is not an offence under the representation of people act, 1951. it does not lead to a member being debarred from contesting elections.one could argue that this lacuna in law has been exploited by all political parties. the constitution left it to the discretion of the electorate whether a member should be re-elected or not. but, in a country where elections are dominated by caste and muscle power, poetic justice must not be expected through electoral process.the case of karnataka once again emphasises that courts have no way to prevent poaching or horse trading. individual cases can be tried under anti-corruption act or sections of indian penal code but there is no legislative or judicial wisdom or precedent to avoid this situation in the first place.also read: bjp in karnataka: the number gamewatch | karnataka election drama: will yeddyurappa get the numbers to prove
