""it is a free nation, i am a free thinker. we should have the liberty to do what we want. you may have strong moral values but you lack leadership skills,"" argued bhagat. the author also reminded him that to be in politics, it was imperative that the baba learn to be less rigid and more accommodative.

2016-12-16,"demonetisation stirs the lives of tea garden workers, forced to eat flowers and leaves for survival","the problems of the tea garden workers seems to refuse to end despite several promises being made to end them in past one month with now many of them forced to eat tea leaves and flowers for mere survival. the annoucement of demonetisation has just added fuel to the fire and added to the set of issues they have already been fighting for.the tea garden workers are even unable to get there minimum wages since november. the darjeeling district in west bengal has 68 tea gardens, out of which 38 have been able to pay only a week's wages to their workers since november 8th.the tea garden workers of the alipurduar district, another tea producing district of west bengal continue to suffer due to lack of money and food in their homes.""now that our garden is not doing well we are not able to buy vegetables and eat. children get some flowers of the tea leaves and we just cook that and eat,"" lamented kalyani gope, a worker at the tea garden.kalyani is not alone...the lack of money in the market is forcing the workers and their family to consume any food that is available and this is leading to lack of nutrient in them.""we don't feel full with just the flowers, but we have no other option. so because of this, our body is also not getting enough nutrients and we are finding it difficult to work,"" said, martha nag another worker.the delayed payments are compelling the workers to leave the tea gardens and fetch work in various other industries. ""many people have left the work of the garden and went on to find work elsewhere. even people from my family have left, my younger son has left and went out to work because money is needed urgently and working at tea gardens leads to delay in payments,"" said, sancharia oraona, a worker herself and mother of two.tea gardens have been compelled to close down and end operations abruptly. even the owners of some tea gardens have fled or have gone missing leaving the labours in a lurch.while in north bengal, about 3.5 lakh workers in tea gardens get their wages in cash. their daily wage is rs 132.50. a garden can pay its workers either weekly or fortnightly. in siliguri citing non-availability of cash, the owner of the tirhana tea garden, which is the one of the biggest tea gardens, has fled along with his manager after the management was unable to pay off the dues of their tea garden workers, leaving almost 2000 workers without their jobs.situated near bagdodra, the tirhana tea garden had a productivity of 10.5 lakh kg of tea per year, employing over 2000 workers, who were completely dependent on the tea garden for feeding their families. but it is no more functional for more than a fortnight now.bir bahadur thapa, one of the local tea garden workers explained, ""even after working for 8-16 hours a day, even at night, we are not receiving our payments. there is no one to even answer when we will get our duea, if at all. we all have children whom we have to teach and pay money for, we have problems regarding food, drinks and clothes. even after working day and night for a month our owner is not paying attention to us. we have asked for our wages time and again but we have just heard excuses and given dates. we are in grave problems as we do not have any money even to buy food or medicine.""toeing the lines of blame game of chief minister mamata banerjee that central government is biased towards assam, a bjp ruled state, by giving them more funds to run tea gardens, trinamool leaders on ground too are echoing the same.a local inttuc leader said, ""the tirhana garden is totally the management's responsibility not the union or tmc's responsibility. on the contrary, the modi government is somewhere responsible for this, because it is a result of the note ban implemented by the centre. they had not been paid their dues for the past 5 weeks and that is why almost all tea garden workers are on an agitation. the owner and the manager of the tea garden have fled the scene without any prior notice. there is no fault of the govt. we have already informed the party leaders about it, who have promised to look into the matter and help the tea workers get their share of justice and assured them that the tea gardens will be running again, soon.""despite the problems, the bank officials in alipurduar are trying their best to get money and digitalisation to the doorsteps of the workers. on the other hand, in siliguri the state government is looking

is s.s. ahluwalia who had won with support of gorkha janmukti morcha, promising gorkhaland and acche din to tea garden workers.nothing much has improved past two years. on the contrary trinamool is making inroads with its divide and rule policy by successfully dividing morcha leaders giving them better platform, designations and fund flow from state treasury.no political party has focussed on solving of the problem of sick tea gardens. the sufferers in all this no one else but these daily wage earners.as per baseline survey conducted by the tea board, there are over 750 tea gardens in the state of assam employing over 65,000 workers while west bengal has over 300 gardens that employ over 30,000 workers.for most of the tea estates in assam, demonetisation and the state government's order to move over to bank transfer of wages by january was already a serious disruption to their routine.the assam state government's decision to move over to bank transfer of wages for tea garden workers has failed miserably as the banks claim that they do not have enough cash to pay to the labourers.according to sources in tea board of india, ""on an average, a tea garden needs rs 10 lakh per week to pay wages to the labourers.""furthermore, in tinsukia district of assam the problem is the reluctance of the workers in accepting the ways of digitisation.being illiterate, the tea garden workers of tinsukia find it difficult to use the atms and withdraw money, thus demanding the payment to be made in the traditional way. at present, no tea gardens have closed in assam.however, there are six tea gardens closed in the state of west bengal.a total of 5,800 permanent and temporary workers have lost their jobs since the six gardens shut down. perhaps the clock is ticking and kettle is

2017-01-05,india today-axis opinion poll on uttarakhand: bjp ahead in direct fight with congress ,"among the five states going to polls in february-march, uttarakhand is the only one where there is a direct fight between the congress and bharatiya janata party (bjp). the congress will want to win the state to provide some impetus to its 2019 campaign. on the other hand, the bjp would aim to dethrone the harish rawat government for its winning streak to continue.the india today-axis opinion poll shows that the congress will find it tough to retain power in this hilly state. the opinion poll has given bjp 41-46 seats in the 70-seat assembly. the congress 18-23 seats while others could get 2-6 seats.the key takewaways:in the survey conducted in uttarakhand between december 12-22, 2016, the bjp emerged as the clear winner bagging 41-46 seats. the congress is likely to win 18-23 seats.other parties and independent candidates are not expected to have any significant impact as they could get only 2-6 seats.the survey also showed that the bjp is way ahead of congress and other parties in terms of vote share. while the bjp is expected to get 45 per cent of vote share, congres may come a distant second with 33 per cent of vote share. others just 22 per cent. harish rawat may have won the battle against the bjp to cling on to the cm's chair but the india today-axis opinion poll shows that bjp's bc khanduri is a popular choice for the top post. however, there is a tight contest between the two leaders.while 44 per cent of respondents said khanduri should be the cm, 42 per cent favoured harish rawat. bjp's ramesh pokhriyal is also in contention getting support of 3 per cent people. bs koshyari is also wanted by 3 per cent of people to be on the cm chair. satpal maharaj got support of 2 per cent respondents.pm narendra modi's demonetisation move will certainly be a poll issue in the assembly election. however, the bjp seems to be benefitting from it. a majority of respondents (79 per cent) view the note ban as good. 19 per cent people termed it as bad while remaining two per cent were undecided.when asked whether people were facing problems due to demonetisation, an overwhelming 53 per cent responded in negative while the other 47 per cent said they have been troubled by it.the survey showed that development will be the single-biggest issue in these polls. issues like inflation (16 per cent), corruption (13 per cent), and employment (12 per cent) will also find mention.interestingly, respondents didn't blame the bjp for last year's political crisis in the state. 59 per cent people said the bjp was not responsible for it while the remaining 27 per cent believed that the main opposition party was indeed behind rawat's removal from cm's post for a short duration.uttarakhand witnessed high drama in march 2016 when nine congress mlas switched sides and met governor kk paul alongwith 27 other bjp mlas to demanding removal of cm harish rawat. the cm later met the governor claiming that he has support of majority of mlas in the 71-seat assembly.president's rule was imposed in the state a day before rawat was to prove majority

2017-09-21,rahul gandhi has a plan to create more jobs in india. here's how he will do it,"job creation in one of the biggest challenges that the narendra modi government is facing and congress vice-president rahul gandhi says he has a plan to tackle the issue.speaking to a small group of nris in new york , united states, rahul gandhi said his party has a vision to create more jobs in india.job creation is the biggest challenge facing in india, gandhi said, adding, ""india cannot give its youngsters a vision if it cannot give them a job.""full transcript of rahul gandhi's speech i'd like to welcome all the people on the stage and every single one of you in this room. you know, many years ago sam came to india and he told you the story of indira gandhiji listening to his presentation. sam, i think it was 1982? yes, 1982. i was 12 years old. in the morning my father told me that there is a presentation and you have to come. i didn't know what presentation meant, i thought i was going to get a present. anyway, i went there, and my sister and i were made to sit down at the back of the room quietly. and we sat there for 6 hours. and sam and my father discussed computers. i didn't quite understand what a computer was, nobody actually in 1982 really understood what a computer was.to me it looked like a little box with a tv screen on it. and frankly i didn't like that presentation, as a little kid, i couldn't stand the fact that i had to sit for 6 hours. and four or 5 years later, i started to see the result of that presentation. there were typewriters in the prime ministers office. and everybody wanted to use a typewriter. and sam and my father said to everyone in the pmo's office that everyone has to move to computers. and everybody said, no, we like our typewriters, we don't want computers. so in sam and in my fathers typical style they said fine you can keep your typewriters, what we are going to do is, we are going to replace typewriters with computers for one month, and after one month we will have your typewriters back. they gave them the computers for one month and then after one month they said ok we are bringing your typewriters back and everyone started to fight, no, we dont want our typewriters back we want the computer.ideas take time to travel into india. but, when an idea is good, india understands it very quickly, and uses it and shows the world how it can be used.i have been talking to sam and i made a point in the car to him and he said ""i hadn't thought about it"". you are all non resident indians.the original congress movement was an nri movement. mahatma gandhi was an nri, jawaharlal nehru came back from england, ambedkar, azad, patel, these were all nris. every single one of them went to the outside world, saw the outside world, returned back to india and used some the ideas they got and transformed india. i'll go even further, the biggest success in india, our friends in bjp said nothing happened, but one of the biggest successes in india, the milk that most of india drinks, it was man called mr. kurien, he was an nri. he came from the united states and he transformed india. sam is another example. there are thousands of examples that we have not recognised. so before i even get into the depth of my speech, i want to tell you that i went from san fransisco to los angeles to washington to new york, i addressed people in berkeley ,in princeton, and wherever i went, you made me feel poud to be an india.everywhere you look in this country, there is an indian person working for america, working for india, living peacefully and building this country and our country.so i would like to start by telling you, that you are actually the backbone of our country. some people view india as a geophraphical construct. they view india as a piece of land. i don't view india as a piece of land. i view india as a set of ideas. so for me, anybody who has the ideas that make up india is an indian.we have many religions in our country. we have many different languages in our country. every single one of them lives happily together, and the reason they have been able to do so are the ideas of the congress party. sam pitroda just said that the congress is a hundred and thirty years old. yes, it is true, the congress organisation is more than a century old. but, the congress idea in india is thousands of years old. we don't represent an organisation, we represent a philosophy that is thousands and thousands of years old. i'll tell you a little but about what this philosophy is. what did gandhi actually fight for, what was our freedom movement about, what did mr. kurien do? what did sam pitroda do? what do thousands of nris do? they stand up for the truth. it doesn't matter what is standing against them, when they believe in something and they are convinced that is the truth they stand up for it and pay the price for it. that is the congress idea.i had lots of conversations in my trip. i met lot of people from the administration, i met people from both democratic and republican parties, i met many friends, nri friends.and i must tell you, i was very surprised because before i could even tell them what i was feeling, before i could even tell them what i was worried about, they told me exactly the same thing. and the single biggest thing most people told me, what has happened to the tolerance that used to prevail in india?what has happened to the harmony in india?there are a couple of challenges that india is facing. the single biggest challenge and i'll give it to you in numbers. 30,000 youngsters come into the job market every single day. today, only 450 of them are getting a job. i'm not even talking about the unemployed.this is the biggest challenge in front of our country. and, this challenge is going to be addressed by building a unified approach by bringing people together.we discuss everything in india. there's a divisive politics in india but the real challenge facing india is that 30,000 youngsters looking for a job and only 450 getting a job.you can imagine as this process continues what the result will be. india simply cannot give its youngsters a vision if it is unable to give them a job. the congress party has a vision to solve this problem. and i will tell you little bit about this vision. currently, the entire focus is on 50 or 60 really large companies. we believe that if you are to create millions and millions of jobs in india, it has to be done by empowering small and medium businesses and entrepreneurs.second, i'll give you another number, 40% of india's vegetables rot. agriculture can simply not be ignored. there are people from punjab here, you will understand exactly what i am saying.agriculture is a strategic asset. we need to build agriculture, we need to develop a cold chain, we need to put food processing units close to farms, and we need to empower indian agriculture. we need to empower our farmers.healthcare is going to transform. and i said this in my speech in berkeley, today all the information in healthcare is in the doctors memories tomorrow all that information is going to be in computers. india has the world's second largest population. we do very large number of surgeries, heart surgeries, eye surgeries, we have a great understanding of how to do these things. there is a huge opportunity for india in healthcare and we can become the healthcare centre of the world but we have to plan for it today. and i am not talking about simply health tourism, i'm talking about about constructing whereby in the future large parts of medical processes are acrid out in our country.i can give you a similar vision for the iits. i went to berkeley, i was in princeton yesterday. us universities are networks, knowledge networks. information travels within them, they are connected to businesses, they are connected to economy. our iits are tremendous institutions but they are not networks. if we connect our iits to our industries and businesses across the world, they will start to compete with the best businesses in the world. these are things that can be done. i, want to go back to the beginning of my speech- you need to get involved. you have tremendous knowledge, you have tremendous understanding, you work in different fields. i invite you to come and work with the congress party and discuss the vision going forward. we want to take your help. sam pitroda single handedly transformed the telecom industry. we don't want one sam pitroda. we want atleast 10-15 sam pitrodas to transform india, because there's a lot of work to be done in india.the last thing i'd like to say to you, india has always shown the world how to live in harmony. for thousands of years india has had a reputation of peace and harmony. this is being challenged. there are forces in our country that are dividing the country and it is very dangerous for the country and it ruins our reputation abroad.many, many people in the democratic party and the republican party asked me what is going on in your country? we always believed that your country worked together, we always believed your country was peaceful. what is going on in your country?and that is something we have to fight. india's reputation in the world is very important. the world is transforming and people are looking towards us. china is rising, we have a relationship with the unites states. many countries in a violent world are looking to india and saying maybe, india has the answer to the 21st century. maybe india has the answer for peaceful coexistence in the 21st century. so, we cannot afford to lose our most powerful asset. our most important asset is that 1.3 billion people lived happily, non-violently, peacefully and the world respected us for that. this is something that as congress people every single one of us has to defend. india is a country that belongs to all its people. doesn't matter who they are i can see my sikh brothers, people from different states. india does not belong to any one of you. india belongs to this entire room and india belongs to every single one of us and that is what the congress party is. again, i'd like to thank you very much and i've told sam, whenever you want me to come to the unites states, whenever you want me to come anywhere, just call me, mein haazir ho jaunga. and final thing, i told sam today, he said about the photographs and i have learnt something, sam hamarein yahan individual photographs chalti hain, so next time we will give a decent amount of time so that we can have selfies or photographs together. thank you very much, all the best!watch: rahul gandhi renews attack on modi government in berkeley, says note ban caused tremendous damage ",0.13988166154832826,rahul gandhi plan create jobs india.

2017-10-01,the big yashwant sinha-arun jaitley debate: why the indian economy is not doing as badly as some have claimed,"there is a joke going on social media that as the opposition is extremely weak and lacks credible voice, the bjp has put its own men - subramanian swamy, shatrughan sinha and yashwant sinha - to criticise government's economic policies.many people ignored the comments of subramanian swamy made in mid-september when he said that the country's economy was heading towards depression. questions, however, were being asked by experts regarding sliding gdp growth rate figures.but, it took a former union finance minister yashwant sinha to have a raging debate over the health of indian economy. yashwant sinha's remark ""the economy is on a downward spiral, is poised for a hard landing"" has energised the opposition camp. sinha's criticism seemed more credible than those done by the opposition leaders.however, debate that ensued after yashwant sinha's criticism has denounced almost everything about indian economy. this is despite the fact that even at 5.7 per cent gdp growth rate for june-september quarter, india is among the fastest growing big economies of the world.the global agencies are still optimistic and rate india's growth potential as high. some agencies even acknowledge reform measures taken by the present narendra modi government including demonetisation and the goods and services tax (gst) rollout giving a push to digitisation and formalisation of businesses in india as much needed course correction.morgan stanley reportthe morgan stanley, a leading global financial services firm, has lauded the measures taken by the narendra modi government to give a digital push to economy.praising the jam (jan dhan, aadhaar and mobile) initiative and gst, a morgan stanley research has said that in 10 years, india will be the world's third-largest economy with a gross domestic product of usd 6 trillion.patting the back of the government for bringing economic reforms, the morgan stanley report said that a rapid rise in consumer credit and credit to micro-, small- and medium-sized enterprises will be witnessed in india.it further said that the economic growth will be accompanied with strong household consumption and a declining share of food in the consumption basket. it predicted a usd 200 billion e-commerce market, making about 12 per cent of india's retail sector by 2027.what other agencies say?the international monetary fund (imf), too, has predictsed that india's economic growth rate will pick up faster. it said that the cash shortages in cash depended sectors of economy will gradually end and give a more vigorous push to economy.according to the imf, the gdp growth rate of india is likely to be 7.2 per cent for 2017-18. this estimate has been made by the imf despite the last quarter growth was pegged at 5.7 per cent.some other agencies, though, lowered the growth forecasts for india but still said that it would grow at faster pace. the asian development bank (adb), lowering the 2017 growth forecast, said that india would grow at 7 per cent.the adb had predicted a growth rate of 7.4 per cent for india in july. but, after the gdp figures of june-september quarter came out, it revised its forecast. the adb attributed lowering of growth forecast to ""short-term disruptions"" including demonetisation and gst. but, it stated the temporary effects of demonetisation and indirect tax reform would ""dissipate"" soon.the organisation for economic cooperation and development (oecd) had on 20 september predicted that indian economy would grow at 6.7 per cent this year. its earlier growth projection for india was 7.3 per cent. the oecd also attributed the lower growth forecast to ""transitory effects"" of demonetisation and gst rollout.all agencies, however, agree that the reforms have given a digital push to indian economy leading to greater formalisation of businesses in the country.are there any other positive signs?the gdp growth figures are not yet final. there are reports that suggest that some adjustments (which happen every year) may actually push the growth figures even for june-september quarter this year.according to the new gdp figures, the estimates of industrial production put out by the ministry of corporate affairs were markedly different from the figures of index of industrial production (iip). the corporate affairs department's data projects industrial production growth rate at 1.6 per cent while the iip shows a growth rate of 1.9 per cent.on the other hand, niti aayog vice-chairman rajiv kumar recently emphasised that the economic downturn of india had bottomed out and would improve in the next two quarters. he too expected the temporary ""problems"" were caused by demonetisation and gst rollout but asserted that people had adopted the new regime effectively.another interesting data may actually work in favour of the narendra modi government. contrary to dominant perception that rural labour wages have declined since demonetisation last year, the labour bureau data shows an upward swing.according the data available with the labour bureau of india, the real wages were rising (as calculated by noted economist surjit bhalla, published in a leading newspaper) at 2 per cent when demonetisation was announced.nine months after demonetisation, the wages grew at five per cent (in july) - more than double the rate at note ban stage. this increase may actually explain why the bjp has won almost all assembly elections after demonetisation. rural india - the source of majority of labour workforce - still constitutes nearly 55 per cent of total vote bank.",0.08323076923076922,big yashwant sinha-arun jaitley debate : indian

2017-10-21,this is why pm narendra modi is visiting gujarat so frequently?,"prime minister narendra modi is in gujarat today - third time in october, ninth time this year and about a dozenth time in the past one-and-a-half years. narendra modi's gujarat itinerary included inauguration and and laying down of foundation stones of a number of projects worth over rs 1,140 crore in bhavnagar and vadodara districts.this could be pm modi's last visit to gujarat before the election commission announces poll dates for the state. the poll panel has already clarified that the election process in gujarat will be over by december 18, the date of counting of votes for himachal pradesh polls.pm narendra modi previously visited gujarat on october 8 and also on october 16. the increased frequency of pm modi's visits to gujarat is clearly a part of the bjp's election strategy in the state, where it is facing some serious challenges.impact of note ban, gst demonetisation and the goods and services tax did not go down well with the gujarati traders and businessmen. they have consistently raised their voice against the sudden implementation of note ban and the gst.however, after the gst council gave some relaxations to traders earlier this month, pm modi declared in gujarat that amended rules brought early diwali. ahead of the gst council meet, pm modi had held a longish meeting with finance minister arun jaitley and bjp chief amit shah in delhi.amit shah had to cut short his ongoing gujarat visit to come to attend the meet. pm modi reportedly asked the finance minister to make sure that the gst council agreed to give certain relaxations, which were considered crucial in view of gujarat elections.a congress undercurrent?the bjp has not recovered from the jolt it received in gujarat with narendra modi shifting from gandhinagar to new delhi as prime minister in 2014. modi's absence created a vacuum in gujarat bjp's leadership which still persists.in the subsequent elections to local bodies, the congress has not only closed the gap, but in some cases has taken over the bjp since 2014. the congress had already managed to improve its vote share in the last assembly election over the previous state polls.in the 2009 gujarat assembly polls, the gap between the bjp and the congress was 9.49 per cent, which stood at 9 per cent in 2012 while narendra modi was still ruling the state. the electrifying electioneering by narendra modi gave the bjp a huge jump from 46.5 per cent votes in 2009 to 59.1 per cent in 2014. the congress' share reduced from 43.2 per cent to 32.9 per cent over the same period.but, the congress has effected a complete reversal of fortunes in the panchayat and municipality elections. in 2010, the congress controlled one district panchayat with 44 per cent vote share, while the bjp ruled 30 district panchayats with 50.26 per cent votes.in 2015 - first panchayat polls after modi became the prime minister - the congress came back with a bang, winning 24 district panchayats with 47.85 per cent of the polled votes. the bjp could manage to win only six out of 31 district panchayats with 43.97 per cent votes.out of 230, the number of taluka panchayats won by congress jumped from 26 with 42.42 per cent votes in 2010 to 134 with 46 per cent votes in 2015. the bjp's tally reduced from 150 with 48.51 per cent to only 67 with 42.32 votes in 2015. the impact of modi's absence on the bjp in gujarat was telling.sensing this undercurrent, congress leader and political advisor to party president sonia gandhi, ahmad patel had earlier this year said, ""if we don't win this election, we may not win another election again in gujarat."" if his recent focus on gujarat is any indication, congress vice-president rahul gandhi, too, seems to believe that this is the best chance for the congress to get back to power in the state. caste politics in gujaratin 2014, modi had won from both vadodara and varanasi parliamentary constituencies. he chose to represent varanasi in the lok sabha. the vadodara seat came to the bjp's fold but this meant that there was no electoral connect between pm modi and his home state gujarat.many players suddenly became dominant and occupied centre-stage in gujarat politics. patidar leader hardik patel campaigned extensively across the state drawing huge crowds. hardik patel demands a quota for patels under the obc category. the patels are not classified as obc in gujarat.patels constitute 12 per cent of gujarat's population. they have been a dominant voice in gujarat's politics and business. but rising unemployment among the youth has given credence to the voice of hardik patel, who is back in gujarat after having been externed for a year following a case of sedition.hardik patel has galvanised the community members to such an extent that powerful patel community leaders, including state ministers nitin patel and saurabh patel, were not allowed to hold public rallies earlier this year in gujarat. they had to cancel their rallies in patel-dominated areas.obc agitationon the other hand, obc leader alpesh thakor has launched a parallel campaign against attempts to accommodate patels for quota benefits. alpesh thakor is the president of obc sc st ekta manch and gujarat kshatriya thakor sena.in his rallies, alpesh thakor claims that obcs, scs and sts constitute 78 per cent population of gujarat. he alleges that despite forming an overwhelming majority in gujarat, these three communities have been ignored by the bjp government in the last 22 years. alpesh thakor is now joining the congress.the census data of casts is available only for 1931, according to which the obc community forms over 40 per cent of gujarat's population. some other reports say that their share in gujarat's population could be as high as 54 per cent. the bjp cannot afford to antagonise the community and dream of winning the election.dalit angerdalits are also angry, particularly after the una incident. youths of a family were thrashed by some self-styled cow vigilantes as they suspected that the dalits had killed the cow, which they were skinning as part of their profession.the incident led to widespread condemnation of the bjp government led by anandiben patel. lawyer-turned-dalit leader jignesh mevani has been canvassing to unite his community to stand against the bjp in the upcoming gujarat election.anandiben patel was removed as the chief minister of gujarat after the una incident. however, mishandling of the hardik patel episode was also one of the reasons for her sacking, which was presented by the bjp as a case of retiring from active politics on account of age.mevani has raised several incidents of brutality against dalits in gujarat since the una incident, which proved to be a flashpoint. on one occasion last year, dalit protestors surrounded the homes of dalit mp kirit solanki and asarva mla rajnikant patel in ahmedabad last year.with gst relaxations and a strong base among the obcs, pm modi and amit shah hope to keep them electorally loyal to the bjp. but patels, dalits and muslims may still create problems for the bjp in gujarat election. together, they constitute about 32 per cent of gujarat's population.watch video | working hard to ensure greater income for farmers: pm modi in gujarat ",0.06588273208273207,pm narendra modi visiting gujarat frequently ?,"prime minister narendra modi gujarat today -

2017-10-31,"world bank's ease of doing business report out today, and modi govt can't wait","right in the middle of economic slowdown and incessant attacks from the opposition, the narendra modi government expects it will have a cause for some cheer today, when the world bank releases its 2018 edition of the ease of doing business report. so significant is india's rise in becoming a business-friendly nation that finance minister arun jaitley will himself be holding a press conference in the evening to underline how it was achieved.ahead of the crucial gujarat election in which the state of the economy is a big agenda, any significant improvement in the ease of doing business ranking by the world bank will be an economic and political plus for the bjp-led government.top sources in the government say an improvement is in the offing since the government has initiated multiple reforms in this direction. almost every policy measure announced in the last couple of years has a built-in improvement in the ease of doing business component. the eventual target is to break into the league of the top 50 in the world. currently, india hopes to break into the top 100 nations, or close to 100 from the last ranking of 130.traders may be protesting against its implementation, but the sentiment in the corridors in the north and south blocks on the raisina hill in the national capital is positive that the launch of the goods and services tax (gst) has sent out a signal to the world that india is not only rationalising its taxation system, but also attempting to improve the ecosystem for business.several elements are taken into account by the world bank to prepare its ease of doing business list. for example, on paying taxes, india's rank is 172. this particular criterion is likely to drive india's improved standing in ease of doing business. the government has eased corporate tax pressure and reduced paperwork for filing returns after the july 1 launch of the gst.the gst has subsumed nearly 40 taxes and cesses, which used to require a lot of paperwork and compliance for businesses.world bank report on impact of govt's reforms on india's ranking in futurein its last report, the world bank had talked about the reforms initiated by the government and the possible impact on india's ranking in future.the insolvency and bankruptcy law to facilitate a quick end to failed businesses was passed in 2016, its implementation began this year. this is yet another component which will eventually lead to india's improved ranking in future as it took off well before the cutoff.with demonetisation too, the government expects a big expansion in the tax base. at the recently held world bank and international monetary fund annual meetings in washington, note ban was talked about as a major reform move to clear the parallel economy.there has also been an improvement in india's record on protecting minority investors as a result of a slew of measures initiated by the securities and exchange board of india (sebi). that was why india moved from a 155 rank to 151 last year.also watch video | gst council meet: exporters to get e-wallets

2017-11-06,"demonetisation anniversary: will himachal, gujarat polls be another referendum on note ban?","come november 8 - the first anniversary of demonetisation initiative announced at 8 pm by prime minister narendra modi - the bjp-led nda government at the centre and the opposition alike have decided to observe the day to suit their own political agenda. while the opposition will observe november 8 as black day, the bjp has decided to counter it by celebrating the day as anti-black money day (kala dhan virodh diwas).with the voters in mind, while the bjp seeks to showcase demonetisation as one of the major achievements of the modi government in over three years of its term, the opposition is trying its best to discredit the government and harm it to the maximum.gujarat and himachal pradesh pollsperhaps demonetisation would not have been raked up with gusto by the rival parties but for the upcoming assembly elections in himachal pradesh and gujarat. the hilly state of uttarakhand goes to polls on november 9, just a day after the first anniversary of demonetisation move. the western state of gujarat faces election in two phases, on december 9 and 14, the first phase taking place a month after demonetisation's first anniversary.the opposition has sought to turn almost every election held after november 8 as a referendum on demonetisation. however, the bjp seems to have won most of them.the opposition has again linked note ban with the gujarat and himachal pradesh elections. with the economy slowing down and gst putting the traders to inconvenience, elections in these two states are the toughest challenge for the bjp post-demonetisation.if the bjp loses, the opposition including the congress will declare it as a referendum on demonetisation. otherwise, the bjp will once again claim that demonetisation has been a runaway success.the only issue remains whether the opposition will rake up demonetisation again in the 2018 assembly elections such as in karnataka, madhya pradesh, rajasthan, chhattisgarh and the 2019 lok sabha elections or the gujarat and uttarakhand assembly elections would settle the matter once and for all?the congress is in the forefront of the opposition parties' plan to protest demonetisation on november 8. with congress vice-president rahul gandhi already calling it a ""sad day"", the party plans to hold a number of activities to buttress their point.the uttar pradesh (up) unit of the congress has announced that it would hold a candlelight march to protest the demonetisation initiative. the unit will also submit a memorandum to the prime minister's office to demand compensation of rs 25 lakh and job to the next of kin of the people who lost their life during demonetisation.calling demonetisation as a ""scam"" which destroyed the country's economy, trinamool congress chief and west bengal chief minister mamata banerjee has exhorted twitterati to change their profile pictures to black as a mark of protest. in fact, she has taken the lead by already changing her own dp (display picture) on twitter.#noteban is a disaster. on #nov8blackday to protest against this scam that destroyed the economy, let us also change our twitter dp to black pic.twitter.com/yrhespize5- mamata banerjee (@mamataofficial) november 6, 2017when pm modi had announced the demonetisation initiative on november 8, the opposition had viewed it with scepticism. while banerjee had demanded its roll back, delhi chief minister arvind kejriwal had apprehended that the modi government's could lead to revolt by the people against the government. kejriwal gave a call to ""change pm, not notes"".bjp extols positive outcomethe bjp and its government have always stood their ground on the demonetisation move. the bjp has extolled the positive outcomes of note ban.while campaigning in himachal pradesh on sunday, pm modi said that over 3 lakh companies have shut down after demonetisation. a probe into 5,000 such firms has found a fraud of rs 4,000 crore even as investigation against others was still on.he said the congress was ""angry"" at demonetisation as it was still feeling its impact. he cited it as the reason for the party's protests. some people who faced the heat of demonetisation were still complaining and were planning to observe 8 november as 'black day', he added.finance minister arun jaitley has claimed that demonetisation has served all its three objectives - to squeeze cash economy, promote digital transactions in business and widen the tax base.bjp's claims notwithstanding, the jury is still out on the economic benefits of demonetisation. however, the bjp may have reasons to believe that note ban has so far helped it reap immense political dividends.a number of elections have taken place since the demonetisation drive was launched. and the bjp has won most of them. be they lok sabha and assembly bypolls, state, municipal and panchayat elections, the bjp has romped home victorious in majority of them.lok sabha and assembly bypollsby-elections to four lok sabha and eight assembly constituencies in six states and one union territory were held on november 19 last year, just 11 days after modi announced the demonetisation move. in the results which were announced on november 22, bjp and trinamool congress won two lok sabha seats each.in the assembly by-polls, bjp and aiadmk won three seats each, cpi(m) got two while congress and trinamool bagged one seat each.the bjp did not lose any lok sabha or assembly seat in these bypolls .assembly pollsthe bjp won up election by a three-fourths majority. up is the most populous state in the country with largely rural background. the impact of demonetisation was supposed to have adversely affected up the most.the other four states - uttarakhand, goa, manipur and punjab - which went to polls in february and march also felt the impact of note ban. while the bjp also won uttarakhand besides up, it came second in goa and manipur. however, it went on to form government in the last two states.the bjp was a junior partner in punjab and the previous government led by the shiromani akali dal (sad) was facing a massive anti-incumbency sentiment after 10 years of rule.the demonetisation initiative would have been listed as one of the most important reasons behind bjp's failure had the party lost up or fared poorly in the other states.however, the congress views the results in the assembly elections as a defeat for the bjp. p chidambaram told india today on a special programme demonetisation that the bjp won only up and uttarakhand. he said the bjp lost punjab while the congress was the single largest party in both goa and manipur.municipal pollsthe bjp registered a historic win in maharashtra municipal elections held in february. it won eight of the ten municipal corporations that went to polls. in brihanmumbai mumbai corporation (bmc), the richest and most prestigious corporation in the country, bjp improved its tally from 31 last time to 82 this year in a corporation of 227 seats. it was short of shiv sena by just two seats.in the maharashtra urban civic polls, the bjp's performance in the president council elections held on november 27, just 19 days after the demonetisation initiative, was also unprecedented. it emerged as the single largest party. it won more number of posts than it did the last time.the bjp's tally rose from 25 corporator seats in the previous election to 119. the congress, which had won 150 corporator seats last time, managed to take a lead on 126 seats, thus ceding ground to rival bjp.in maharashtra rural municipal polls, the bjp captured two municipalities and one taluka panchayat in local bodies elections, the results of which were declared on november 29. the bjp also maintained its lead on 23 out of 31 other seats of various municipalities, taluka and district panchayats, where by-polls were held.in the elections to the municipal corporation of delhi (mcd) too held in april this year, the bjp retained all the three bodies.panchayat pollsout of the 37 seats on which local bodies by-elections were held in rajasthan on november 29, 21 days after the demonetisation move, the ruling bjp won 19 seats while congress was victorious on 14 seats. in fact, the two parties gained one seat each in the by-polls held for panchayat and municipal seats in the state.in the panchayat elections held in february in odisha, bjp made unprecedented gains. of the total 853 seats, bjp bagged 306 seats - an increase of 8.5 times as compared with its tally of just 36 seats in 2012. it added 270 seats to its previous tally.on the other hand, ruling bjd won 460 seats as against its victory on 651 seats in 2012, losing 191. congress bagged just 66 seats against the 126 in the previous elections, losing 60.watch: gujarat opinion poll: results of the india today-axis my india opinion 2017 survey ",0.0689362674362674,"demonetisation anniversary : himachal , gujarat polls another referendum note ban ?","come november 8 -

2017-11-08,mitron... it has been a year since that speech,"on november 8, 2016, prime minister narendra modi delivered a surprise primetime address and india was introduced to 'demonetisation'.a day has not passed since that day when india has not discussed that word, demo, demon, demonetisation, note ban, notebandi. a historic decision with historic implications.the evening of november 8, 2016 was a perfectly normal tuesday evening in india. as the day turned into night, all eyes were far away on the united states of america, which was voting in a new president.around 7, word came into the newsroom that the prime minister was expected to address the nation. now that's not a normal thing on just another day. at 8 pm that tuesday, prime minister narendra modi appeared on tv screens across india. nobody knew why the prime minister thought it necessary to deliver a primetime address.the last time the government had delivered a surprise announcement, the world woke up to the news that army troops had crossed the line of control and carried out high-risk ""surgical strikes"" behind enemy lines. but, that declaration took place in the morning, unlike pm modi's november 8 address.for the first few minutes of his speech, pm modi gave no direct indication of what exactly he was there to talk about. the prime minister started off greeting the country on the end of the festive season (diwali had just ended then) before turning the focus on india's economy.slowly, pm modi built the momentum, talking about the ""evil of corruption"", the link between terrorism and fake currency notes, and the steps his administration had taken to curb the prevalence of black money.""there comes a time in the history of a country's development when a need is felt for a strong and decisive step,"" pm modi declared, still refusing to reveal why he was delivering a surprise address on a seemingly random november 8 evening.boom!in fact, it was a full 10 minutes and some 1000 words before pm modi finally said what he was there to say: ""to break the grip of corruption and black money, we have decided that the five hundred rupee and thousand rupee currency notes presently in use will no longer be legal tender from midnight tonight, that is 8th november 2016.""and with that one sentence, india was suddenly thrust into a reality where nearly 85 per cent of the currency in circulation would no longer be valid.the currency notes that no longer are: demonetisation invalidated the rs 500 and rs 1,000 banknotes (file)even as pm modi continued his speech, listing out the salient points of how his government and the reserve bank of india would carry out the demonetisation exercise, people scurried to atms, and made frantic calls to understand what was essentially for india, a new world order. ""demonetisation"", tv channels screamed as news websites to scrambled to write explainers on what was happening while newspaper editors went into the stop-the-press modes, hurriedly churning out a story that pushed donald trump election as us president off the top slot on front pages.in his speech on november 8, pm modi listed out what would happen over the next few days: citizens would have 50 days (until december 31) to deposit the old rs 500 and rs 1,000 notes and atms would be re-calibrated to dispense the new, smaller and more plastic-looking rs 500 and rs 2,000 currency notes.there were restrictions imposed on how much citizens could withdraw in a week as well as how much of the old cash they could exchange for the new notes as the government geared up to meet the daunting challenge of replacing around 85 per cent of india's currency.""let us ignore the temporary hardship... i am confident in the 125 crore people of india, and i am sure the country will get success,"" pm modi said towards the end of his history-changing demonetisation speech, ending with a ""bharat mata ki jai"".did you panic after the demonetisation announcement? you may have been better served if you did, as this infographic from december 2016 explains (newsflicks)when india stood in linesfor the next two days, india attempted to understand the new currency paradigm that it suddenly found itself in. queues were seen outside banks and atms from the very first day, as people attempted to get their hands on the new, valid currency notes. with the new rs 500 and rs 2,000 notes in short supply, rumours about their ""features"" started doing the rounds. some reports spoke of the notes coming with 'nano chips' that could help detect supposed illegal stashes of currency notes via satellites.when citizens complained of the purple ink of the rs 2,000 notes washing off, that too was touted as a ""feature"" by many whatsapp forwards. all the rumours were put to rest, however, when it turned out that the paper notes were just that - pieces of paper bearing the reserve bank of india's promise to pay the bearer a certain sum of money.long queues were seen outside atms and banks in the days after the demonetisation announcement (reuters photo)from november 8 to december 31 (the last day to deposit the old currency notes), india also saw a number of changes in how it could withdraw its money. according to an indiatoday.in report from december 20, the government and the rbi changed the rules around demonetisation 54 times in 42 days.the rbi used the rule changes to slowly increase the limit imposed on how much india could withdraw but the central bank also attracted controversy when it decided that indelible ink (the kind used during election) would be used to prevent citizens from gaming the system and exchanging more cash than they were supposed to.blowbackin the first few days of the demonetisation announcement, the criticism around it had mainly centered on the hardship that it caused the general public. there was anger about the long queues as well as about the near-daily rule changes governing the exchange and withdrawal of cash.the government, however, soon found itself battling criticism on the economic aspect of the demonetisation exercise. on november 24, 2016 - just two weeks after the november 8 address that introduced india to demonetisation - former prime minister manmohan singh tore into the modi government.speaking in rajya sabha, singh delivered his now-famous speech that called demonetisation ""a monumental management failure"" and a case of ""organized loot and legalised plunder of the common people.""the former prime minister also directly took on the modi government's assertion that in the long run, demonetisation would prove to be beneficial by quoting john keynes.""even those who say that this measure will do harm or will cause distress in the short run, but is in the interest of the country in the long run, i am reminded of john keynes, who once said, 'in the long run, we are all dead',"" manmohan singh said.singh, a world renowned economist, also went on to predict that demonetisation would cause india's gross domestic product (gdp) to fall by two per cent points - words that came completely true when data for the april-june 2017 quarter was released in august. december 31 - another speech?perhaps no analogy can best describe what pm modi's november 8 address did to the collective indian psyche than the day of december 31, 2016 when it emerged that pm modi would be addressing the nation yet again.twitter started speculating what surprise pm modi had in store this time around even as bars and pubs in new delhi and mumbai promised to serve shots on the house every time pm modi uttered the word ""mitron"".the speech, as it turned out, was straightforward and to the disappointment of the new year's eve crowds at, bars did not have the word ""mitron"" even once.the days after the note ban announcement saw people employ ingenious ways to use the old rs 500 and rs 1,000 notes (newsflicks)pm modi did not introduce any new measures even as he lauded indians for displaying ""the strength of people power, utmost discipline, and the ability to discern the truth in a storm of disinformation.""the prime minister admitted that his november 8 speech had done something that was globally unprecedented, as he asked political parties to unite to combat the problem of black money.""the new dawn of the new year, comes with the resolve of new success. let us all come together, to move ahead overcoming obstacles and constraints,"" the prime minister ended his speech as india entered a new year, a year in which the old rs 500 and rs 1,000 notes would no longer exist.the aftermathdemonetisation certainly changed how india carries out its transactions. but whether the exercise achieved all the goals that the modi government said it would remains to be seen.the gdp in the quarters after demonetisation was announced has been falling, and, like ex-pm manmohan singh said, saw a drop of two per cent points when the latest data was released in august.the rbi managed to complete 'remonetisation' in february and later even introduced notes in the denomination of rs 200 as the central bank attempted to make everyday transactions easier.data released by the rbi also showed that nearly all of the currency that was invalidated had come back into the banking system.rules governing how much money citizens could withdraw or exchange changed on a near-daily basis in the days after demonetisation (reuters)while critics of the government use this information to advance the argument that demonetisation was essentially a failure, finance minister arun jaitley suggested that money coming back was what was supposed to happen all along.with the money back in the system, the cash has lost its anonymity, jaitley recently said at an india today event, adding that this would help authorities crack down on those who had evaded taxes. at the event, the finance minster presented a full defence of the demonetisation exercise - you can read the major points of his argument here.the opposition, however, has continued its attack on the modi government, making demonetisation a big issue in poll-bound gujarat and himachal pradesh and has -

2017-12-28,"2017 in indian politics: bjp continues dominance, midnight dramas abound, 'neech' politics prove a distraction","there is never a dull moment in politics. especially so, when it is indian politics.2017 in indian politics saw the bharatiya janata party continue its electoral dominance even as india's grand old party, the congress, attempted a turnaround.there were also plenty of moments that surprised (the choice of chief minister in uttar pradesh), befuddled (a politician sitting on public meditation at midnight), and awed the electorate (a party's ability to win a state despite losing its election).here's recapping the year's top political moments:midnight meditation at marina around the turn of the year, all was (mostly) well in tamil nadu politics. yes, there was a power vacuum left behind by the death of j jayalalalithaa, the beloved tamil nadu chief minister and aiadmk supremo who died in december 2016.but, that vacuum was being filled pretty smoothly. ottakkarthevar panneerselvam, a long-time aiadmk loyalist, had replaced jayalalithaa as cm within hours of her death. and come january, amma's close aide vk sasikala was on the homestretch of a plan that would see her become cm.and as an apparent part of this plan, o panneerselvam resigned from the cm's post on february 5. pretty straight-forward politics, so far.it all changed on february 7 when panneerselvam made a late-night dash to jayalalithaa's memorial at marina beach and sat there on meditation. he did not utter a word even as curious onlookers, befuddled supporters and startled journalists gathered around.o panneerselvam at jayalalithaa's memorial on february 7 (pti)finally, after a 40-minute meditation session, panneerselvam awoke, said 'amma's soul had called out to him', and declared war on sasikala. he said he would ""continue to work in amma's name"" and take back his resignation if people were with him.the night pushed tamil nadu politics into turmoil. panneerselvam wasn't able to hold on the cm's chair (though he ultimately joined hands with his successor edappadi palaniswami and became deputy cm), nor was sasikala, thanks to a criminal conviction, able to become the chief minister.aiadmk still remains divided into warring factions and the state's politics saw a fresh twist this month when ttv dhinakaran, sasikala's nephew and part of the camp railing against the ops-eps combine, won the by-poll in rk nagar, the assembly seat vacated by late jayalalithaa.the man from gokrakhpur the political firestorm that followed the narendra modi government's shock demonetisation decision from november 2016 was very much raging in 2017. and in march, note ban, just one of the many expressions used to describe the invalidation of rs 500 and rs 1,000 notes, became an election issue in uttar pradesh.the ruling samajwadi party joined hands with the congress to take on the bharatiya janata party. unsuccessfully so. the bjp, led by the master campaigner narendra modi, won a staggering three-fourths majority in lucknow.the bjp won a landslide victory in the uttar pradesh election (indiatoday.in)click here to enlargethe biggest surprise of the election was what happened after the results were announced: the appointment of yogi adityanath, a firebrand saffron leader and a four-time mp from gorakhpur, as chief minister.adityanath's becoming uttar pradesh cm was widely critiqued by commentators, both positively and otherwise, and his decisions as chief minister were intensely scrutinised.fast-moving bjp catches congress coldif uttar pradesh was the headline of the five-state assembly elections from march this year, then manipur and goa were its post-scripts. of the five states, the bjp won in two (up and uttrakhand), lost in one (punjab) and finished second in the remaining.in goa and manipur, neither of which gave a majority to a single party, the congress won the most number of seats. however, it was the bjp that ended up forming governments in both the states, and ending with 4-1 tally in the five-state polls.once the results were announced on march 11, the bjp moved quickly to stitch up alliances with local parties and - the very next day -announced it had enough numbers to form governments in both the states.the bjp came second in goa and manipur, but still managed to form governments in both the states (ap)pm modi sacrificed his defence minister - manohar parrikar - so that he could return to his home state goa as chief minister (a condition alliance partners in the coastal state put forth for their support) while in manipur the party managed to secure the backing of two independent mlas, a tmc legislator and even a congress defector.the congress claimed the bjp had used money power to 'steal' the two states, but it is worth noting that while saffron party had vote share in goa and manipur even though it ended up fewer seats than the grand old party.mahagathbandhan no more on july 26 evening, bihar chief minister nitish kumar resigned from his post. the next day morning - barely over 12 hours after he resigned - nitish was at bihar's raj bhavan taking the oath of office, once again, to become the state's chief minister, once again.the hours between saw the spectacular end of the 'mahagathbandhan', a grand alliance starring nitish's janata dal (united) (jdu) and lalu prasad yadav's rashtriya janata dal, and the bihar cm's return to the nda fold.nitish's july 26 evening resignation, a result of his discontent over allegations of corruption against his deputy and lalu's son tejashwi, was followed by a series of 'coincidences'.moments after he announced his decision to step down, the bjp, which just happened to be holding a parliamentary meeting in new delhi, announced it would support the jd (u) in bihar. soon after, mlas of the two parties managed a late-night meeting in patna and signed letters of approval backing nitish's return to the cm's chair.2017 saw nitish kumar's return to the nda fold (reuters)in between, pm modi, on twitter, praised nitish for ""joining the fight against corruption"", nitish replied with a thank you and the rjd raged. tejashwi, left to hold the fort with father lalu having to (coincidently) travel to ranchi for a court hearing, even embarked on a post-midnight march to raj bhavan in protest of the developments. but, it all came to naught. nitish was sworn in as chief minster on july 27 and on july 28, won an assembly floor test, bringing about the end of the mahagathbandhan that just two years earlier had handed the bjp a humiliating defeat in the 2015 bihar election.election at midnight this was the third major political moment of the year for which journalists and writers liberally - and justifiably - used the phrase 'midnight drama'. the usually dull rajya sabha elections were an electric, nail-biting affair in gujarat this year, with results for the polls coming only after midnight on august 8.as polling began on august 8, congress' ahmed patel needed the support of 45 mlas to win. and, the congress had 51 mlas in the gujarat assembly.however, thanks to cross-voting, patel apparently managed the support of just 44 mlas, one short of the number required to win his re-election.and so, as day turned into night, the congress went to the mattresses. counting was held up for six hours as the election commission office in new delhi was besieged by delegations from the congress and the bjp.the grand old party alleged two of its mlas had broken voting rules by showing their ballots to bjp chief amit shah and union minister smriti irani (the two were contesting the other gujarat rajya sabha seats which they won comfortably). the bjp, on the other hand, wanted the poll panel to get on with the counting.finally, close to midnight the election commission ruled in favour of the congress and disqualified the votes of the two mlas in the question. this brought the number needed to win down to 44, which meant that nearly at 1.53 am august 9, ahmed patel was able to tweet this:this is not just my victory. it is a defeat of the most blatant use of money power,muscle power and abuse of state machinery- ahmed patel (@ahmedpatel) august 8, 2017of pakistan and 'low-life'more than a 'top moment' this marked a low for indian politics in 2017. in the heat of the gujarat assembly election, political attacks turned ugly and below-the-belt comments were common.the two incidents that stood out for how they dominated the popular discourse were mani shankar aiyar's 'neech kisam ka aadmi' comment and prime minister modi's insinuation that ex-pm manmohan singh conspired with pakistani diplomats and officials to influence the gujarat election.aiyar's comment, directed at pm modi, saw him lose the primary membership of his party, the congress. his clarification (that he hadn't called the pm a 'low-born') and half-apology notwithstanding, pm modi went to town using the comment to corner the congress during his election rallies.at one of these rallies, while talking about the aiyar comment, pm modi suggested that ex-pm singh and former vice president hamid ansari secretly met with some pakistani officials at aiyar's residence in new delhi before the gujarat polls.the congress took umbrage at the pm's suggestion and the controversy continued even ar the gujarat election results, with the grand old party disrupting parliament over its demand that the prime minister apologise for his remarks.the impasse finally ended days before new year's eve, with finance minister arun jaitley saying the government does not question singh's or ansari's commitment to the nation and that it holds the former pm in high regard. the congress, in response, disavowed of any attacks that may have been made on pm modi, which was seen as a reference to aiyar's 'neech' remarks.honourable mentionsthe verdict in the 2g spectrum scam case was a shocker for many. in maharashtra, the shiv sena has announced plans to quit the state-level alliance with the bjp in the coming year.the supreme court, in january 2017 delivered a crucial judgement that held that political parties and politicians cannot seek votes in the name of caste, community, religion or language.and, speaking of electoral politics, 2017 also marked the year the election commission decided that all future elections will conducting using electronic voting machines connected to voter-verifiable paper audit trail (vvpat) devices.what will the future hold for indian politics? we would be foolish to predict
