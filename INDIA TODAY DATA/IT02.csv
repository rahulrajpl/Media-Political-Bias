2009-04-02,"bjp manifesto promises ram, rice and more","the bjp has once again announced that after coming to power it will explore all possibilities for ram temple. the party has touched its old issues like article 370 and cow slaughter to appease its cadre. in a 48-page manifesto, the party has mentioned the issue of ram temple in its last chapter.the bjp waited for the auspicious navami to come out with its election manifesto, promising something to everyone. initially in two minds whether to include the hindutva agenda or not, the party decided to include it at the last minute, saying that it had always been a part of the bjp manifesto.sources said that the manifesto went for printing only after 6 pm on thursday evening after it was decided to include “defending the civilisation” section which talked about the ram mandir, ram setu, cow protection and removal of article 370.populist manifestomost of it populist, the bjp did manage to come up with some thing new in the food coupon concept in a bid to cut the corruption in the public distribution system (pds).outwitting the congress, the bjp said that all bpl families will get 35 kg of rice or wheat every month at rs 2 per kg. this, they said, will be available against food coupons redeemable both at pds and private outlets. the manifesto was released by prime ministerial candidate l.k. advani flanked by party president rajnath singh and senior leaders jaswant singh, venkaiah naidu and arun jaitley. chairman of manifesto committee murali manohar joshi was also there. on ram temple the manifesto says, ""the bjp will explore all possibilities, including negotiations and judicial proceedings, to facilitate the construction of the ram temple in ayodhya.""advani said that on this issue other allies of nda were convinced during last nda government led by bjp. in fact, the party had left its stand of ""construction of ram temple by making law in parliament"" many years ago.the party has revived its demand of removal of article 370 of the constitution saying, ""full integration of the nation is not possible as long as article 370 stays on the statute books. bjp remains in its belief that the provision must be removed to ensure indian unity.""on the cow slaughter issue the manifesto says, ""the cow slaughter is an article of faith with bjp. this will be pursued relentlessly.""the party has also added a new paragraph on the cleaning of river ganga. the manifesto says, ""cleaning the revered ganga and other major rivers will be a priority. local communities will be enrolled in this gigantic task.""emphasising on the ram setu issue, for which the party launched an agitation last year, the manifesto says, ""bjp will not allow anybody to touch the revered ram setu. we will evolve a new route for sethu samudram bypassing ram setu.""though, the party has made these announcements in its manifesto, these contentious issues will remain in freezer since the allies of nda will hardly be ready to accept them.therefore, it is understood that the bjp has made these promises to address its cadre and associates of sangh parivar but practically it will not be possible to go for these issues, unless the bjp alone comes to power.wooing the armed forcesto win over the armed forces and the paramilitary forces – which bjp considers its constituency – the party promised tax-free income. salaried class was promised that income tax exemption limit will be raised to rs 3 lakh per annum. for women and senior citizen, the limit would be rs 3.5 lakh per annum.return of an improved pota-like lawon the internal security front, on which the bjp has always been critical of the upa, it promised return of an improved pota-like law, claiming that fighting terror – both home grown and external – with an iron hand was a priority. the party also promised revamp of country’s intelligence agencies so that they can deal with terror threats in a better way. sops for farmersreaching out to farmers, the bjp said it will waive off all current loans and provide fresh loans at four per cent interest rate. every school-going girl child belonging to bpl families will be provided by a bicycle, the manifesto said.elections only once in five years, bjp's agendathe party has said that ""bjp will seek, through consultation with other parties, to evolve a method of holding assembly and lok sabha elections simultaneously. apart from reducing election expenses for both political parties and government, this will ensure certain stability for state governments.""here are some highlights of the bjp promise:the manifesto has also promised to raise personal income tax exemption level to rs 3 lakh and bring back rs 25,000 crore of black money stashed in foreign banks.with 26/11 fresh in

indo-bangla border to prevent infiltration.for senior citizens, it promises complete income tax exemption.it also proposes to extend the ladli laxmi programme for the girl child across the country.for

2011-10-15,congress trips on secular politics,"congress spokesman janardhan dwivedi's claim that no one from the congress needs to send a letter to anna hazare after the prime minister himself has written to him does not stand scrutiny.the pm's letter was from the government assuring hazare that the lokpal bill and other anti-corruption measures were on track.the second was a letter from digvijaya singh nailing hazare's lie that he was not aware of any rss support to his movement. the former was no substitute for the latter. both essentially were meant for public consumption and not for hazare alone. why is the congress then picking on digvijaya singh?could it be that there are some in the congress party who espouse a soft-hindutva political line instead of a clearly secular one? if that is true then this would not be the first time that this is happening.the congress and the government it led were never ideologically as clear on the issue of secularism as under jawaharlal nehru. in the 1980s, indira gandhi changed gears and started peddling a soft-hindutva line. her son, rajiv gandhi, fumbled on secularism and did not have a clear ideological position. his successor, p v narasimha rao was a covert subscriber to the hindutva ideology.corethe question that is eating the vitals of the congress today, however, is: what do sonia and rahul gandhi stand for? is it only in gujarat that party leaders like shankarsinh vaghela pedal a soft-hindutva line or is it a more widespread phenomenon within the party?the core thinking of conservative congressmen today seems to be to go with the flow. they do not want the party to do anything which upsets the majority view. thus the party was initially dismissive of the ""saffron terror"" theory till overwhelming evidence forced it to change its line. janardhan dwivedi had also contested the use of the term ""saffron terror"" when it was first used. through dwivedi, the party also initially welcomed the allahabad high court verdict legalising the makeshift temple at the disputed babri masjid site, only to backtrack later on realising the adverse fallout of adopting such a position.this ideological confusion was also evident in the way the government and the party handled ramdev and anna hazare. union minister, kamal nath, participated prominently in ramdev's rally in chhindwara on the eve of his departure to launch an agitation against the government in new delhi. later, the nation witnessed a clutch of senior ministers rushing to receive ramdev at the airport when he reached the capital. with anna hazare, the same confused approach was evident - one day, he was portrayed as a gandhian and on another, a stooge of the rss.it could well be that underlying the belief of the soft-hindutva lobby in the congress is the consciousness that it would be impolitic to upset the majority community. this was not how our founding fathers or even the leading lights of the congress thought at the time of independence.today, the congress president herself seems to lack any courage of conviction on this issue. her foreign origins, which do not matter a whit in any other sphere, perhaps make her wary of supporting the secular tradition of indian politics more forthrightly. her attitude to the hindutva forces is exceptionally cautious.such an approach can only demoralise the younger, liberal, secular and modernist elements in the party. it also confuses the government which is unable to take decisive executive action in the face of mixed signals from the party.congressmen would do well to recall how indira gandhi handled with a firm hand the anticow slaughter agitation in 1966 led by several hindu organisations that had marched on parliament and tried to set fire to government buildings. she did not accept their demand to ban cow slaughter and got the police to disperse the agitation.a secular government needs to act decisively against those who challenge the very basis of our polity. that decisive thinking and decision making seems absent from the government and the party which leads it.janardhan dwivedi's action as head of the media department of the congress is deeply disturbing. the party can ill afford to take an ostrich like stand on the political tools that the rss is trying to fashion through ramdev and anna hazare at one level and through its own version of brown shirts like the sriram sene, bajrang dal and the vishwa hindu parishad at another level.rssthe objective of the rss is not to grab political power but to change the contours of politics in india. it wants to create a conservative political climate which represents a coalition between religion and politics and where the religious and the political other is demonised. their attacks on art, culture, books, posters and films are no accidents but an integral part of this agenda. it consists of antipathy to liberalism, freedom of expression, and to theoretical reasoning and intellectualism.the agenda of thought policing and designating individual behaviour as deviant is evident in attacks on artists, writers, young boys and girls celebrating valentine's day, designating gays as sick (ramdev wants to cure them through ayurveda) or even more recently on lawyer prashant bhushan for voicing one of the many opinions that exist in this vast country on the future of kashmir. the politically coercive movement of an anna hazare (who lives in a temple incidentally) or the moral indignation of a ramdev over black money and corruption or any agitation which talks up terrorism and how to deal with it through tough laws presents them with an opportunity to use these movements to further their political programme.one can understand that anna hazare does not understand this. however, if the congress party does not recognise this, then the nation will have to pay a heavy political cost for its shortsightedness. a public that is easy to manipulate and misinform and which is often disinterested and apathetic can easily get taken in by this political agenda. that is why it is important to inform even anna hazare, through a thousand letters if need be, who his supporters really are and what kind of forces he is helping mobilise in this country though his otherwise well intentioned moves.simultaneously, the congress and the upa government must not get sucked into the rss/ bjp, anna hazare, ramdev campaign against it. they have to have their own political agenda. and they do - of promoting good and transparent governance, secularism, providing all round security to citizens irrespective of their religious or other identities, curbing price rice and mitigating the impression that it supports corruption in public life. however, there is a complete communication failure on this count.leadershipthe congress and the upa have failed to project what they have done and are doing to curb corruption - from ending discretionary powers of ministers and government babus, introducing the lokpal bill, the judicial accountability bill, the whistleblower protection bill, amendments to the prevention of corruption act to make it stronger and amending the law to prevent benami property transactions to signing double taxation agreements with 81 countries in the last two years and tax information exchange pacts with four countries to curb and unearth black money. despite these measures the party reacts on issues of corruption as if it had much to hide rather than going on the front foot.if the congress party does not assume an active leadership role and continues to pull its own leaders down, then there is only one way for it - downhill. if it had good political management, the corruption issue would not have been with anna hazare and the opposition.ideological and programmatic clarity constitutes the soul of a political party. and today the congress seems to have lost touch with its core ideology and forgotten the art of setting the political agenda for the nation.",0.05522924664434098,congress trips secular politics,"congress spokesman janardhan dwivedi ' claim one congress needs send letter anna hazare prime minister written stand scrutiny.the pm ' letter government assuring hazare lokpal bill anti-corruption measures track.the second letter digvijaya singh nailing hazare ' lie aware rss support movement. former substitute latter. essentially meant public consumption hazare alone. congress picking digvijaya singh?could congress party espouse soft-hindutva political line instead clearly secular one ? true would first time happening.the congress government led never ideologically clear issue secularism jawaharlal nehru. 1980s , indira gandhi changed gears started peddling soft-hindutva line. son , rajiv gandhi , fumbled secularism clear ideological position. successor , p v narasimha rao covert subscriber hindutva ideology.corethe question eating vitals congress today , however , : sonia rahul gandhi stand ? gujarat party leaders like shankarsinh vaghela pedal soft-hindutva line widespread phenomenon within party?the core thinking conservative congressmen today seems go flow. want party anything upsets majority view. thus party initially dismissive "" saffron terror "" theory till overwhelming evidence forced change line. janardhan dwivedi also contested use term "" saffron terror "" first used. dwivedi , party also initially welcomed allahabad high court verdict legalising makeshift temple disputed babri masjid site , backtrack later realising adverse fallout adopting position.this ideological confusion also evident way government party handled ramdev anna hazare. union minister , kamal nath , participated prominently ramdev ' rally chhindwara eve departure launch agitation government new delhi. later , nation witnessed clutch senior ministers rushing receive ramdev airport reached capital. anna hazare , confused approach evident -

2016-10-02,"mumbai: man who claimed harassment by gau rakshaks cooked up story, booked by police","even as barun kashyap's world which had nearly broken down after being hounded by police with questions in the middle of august was starting to see some normalcy, another emerging piece of news seems to have shattered it. after almost a month and half of investigations and not able to find any clue, mumbai police now believes that kashyap had cooked up the story for some publicity and have now registered a case against him.initial complaint it was on august 19 when kashyap who was heading to work from his home had taken an auto rickshaw. due to his hippy look, kahyap alleged that the auto rickshaw driver started asking him questions. kashyap was carrying a leather bag which was made of camel hide and had been bought a few months ago from pushkar.kashyap alleged that the auto driver ran his hand over his bag and said that he suspected it too had been made of cow hide. after having crossed a distance in auto the rickshaw stopped near a temple and the driver called some of people he knew. he claimed that all of them started harrassing him and planned to escort to him somewhere in the auto. he then said he jumped off the auto at a signal and ran to office where his colleagues told him to go ahead and register a complaint.investigationthe non -cognizable offence that he registered was immediately converted into an fir and encounter specialist daya nayak was put on the job of investigating the case. the police team , reordered several statements from people, sifted through various cctv footages, drew a sketch with kashyaps help of a potential suspect and even tried to get all possible combinations of registration numbers as kashyap was not sure of the auto rickshaw's registration number. they even questioned over 40 auto rickshaw drivers but drew a blank and could not locate any such auto rickshaw driver of kashyap's description.so after a month and half amboli police registered a case against kashyap under various sections of indian penal code. the offences under which kashyap has been booked include section 153, section 182 and section 505 which involved promoting enmity between different groups, using the lawful power of a public servant to the annoyance of others and several other offences.kashyap's refusal to respond kashyap who had refused to give interviews to media from that point onward saying, ""as it is, cops don't believe me. they think this is all for publicity. if i give interviews, they will never believe me."" however now with a case being registered against him, kashyap was quite shocked and said, ""police have not told me of any registration of a case against me. they have stopped questioning me these days and weren't able to find the auto driver either. so i thought they might be busy with the festival season.""a senior police officer at the amboli police station where both of kashyap's fir and now the one against him are registered said that, right now they are investigating the case and if need be then they might arrest kashyap for custodial interrogation.also read:man beaten to death by gau rakshaks

""they want us to compromise and take back the case accepting the money, if we don't, anything can happen to me,"" says jabar singh. ""this is nothing as compared to what we have been through. i could have lost my life, they wouldn't just listen to our explanations that we were dairy farmers but kept thrashing and took us to the police station saying that we were criminals transporting cows for slaughter,"" he adds, lying on the cot.barely 100 meters from here, lives bhoop singh. with a fractured elbow he still doesn't miss serving fodder to his cow.

""they thought i was dead as i lay in a pool of blood on the highway. the cow vigilantes let the driver of the mini-truck go, since he was a hindu,"" says azmat. ""after the thrashing, they threw all of us in one corner, i could hear them shouting, 'burn them, burn them.' we were fortunate that the police arrived just in time, otherwise none of us would have been alive today,"" he adds. his mother recalls the unfortunate moment when azmat called her from jaipur. ""unable to find a cheap buffalo in the fair, azmat told me over phone that he has found a pair of good cows, we thought it will give us enough milk and curd for the upcoming holy month of ramzan,"" says zahira.

""in the hot weather, buffaloes don't yield much milk, so most farmers keep cows here, but after what happened to pehlu khan, people are afraid of buying new cows. this business is doomed if the situation doesn't improve,"" says an agent, who collects milk from the farmers for the local dairy. while alwar police in the bjp-ruled rajasthan has not been able to arrest any of the six men named by pehlu khan in his dying declaration, 7 of those identified from a video of the assault that went viral have been arrested so far. some jaipur based social organisations are perusing the case on behalf of the victims demanding justice and compensation.also read: no beef found in jaipur hotel's food samples: fsl reportalso read: cow vigilante attacks are anything but spontaneous, reveals india today stingalso watch: greater noida: villagers transporting cow mistaken for smugglers, thrashed by mob",0.041362605648319936,"rs 20k broken ribs , rs 10k fractured elbow : cow vigilantes offer price beaten farmers","rs 20,000 broken rib rs 10,000 fractured elbow.

2017-06-02,terrifying to write in a world where everything is shredded into tweets: arundhati roy on upcoming novel,"the hijras in your novel live in a parallel world to what they call 'duniya'. that seems a bit like fiction, it draws from the real world, on 'duniya', is an entire world unto itself but is not 'reality'.the way i feel, even the way i live, is as if there are these covers. and you look underneath, or you look to the side, you look this way or that, and there is this whole other world. there is such a hard, and increasingly hardening, definition of what is 'reality', or what is 'majority', what is 'identity.' all realities that people are unfamiliar with are a little fabulous. just the other day in the paper i saw a report about bakarwals in jammu being attacked by gau rakshaks. it's strange when you write fiction, how it intrudes on reality. about a month ago, this bitch and her puppies started living outside my door and it was, like, oh, comrade laali (a dog from the ministry of utmost happiness) is here.the paresh rawal farrago must feel like a kind of appetiser. this is such a political book, do you worry about the reactions, the abuse that is going to inevitably come your way?i was not the writer, ever, who was going to be 'oh, i've written a book, i've won the booker prize! now i'll write another book, win another prize...' no, i said it back then. i'll write a book when i've a book to write. the only ambition i have, really, is the ambition of art. to experiment. i didn't want to sign some big contract straight away, i wanted to be able to throw stuff away. and in this atmosphere, the idea of putting a novel into a world in which everything is just shredded into tweets was terrifying and have it be shredded into tweets was terrifying. i kept telling myself, 'just write it, and keep it in the drawer. write it how you like and keep it in your drawer. but the writer's ego doesn't permit that, once it's done, you can't keep it.' and this book was a way to look at all these complex issues in different ways, from different perspectives.is that the joy of writing fiction? assuming a variety of voices, putting yourself in the place of other people.yes... biplab dasgupta (a high-ranking intelligence officer in the novel), for instance, is not just a moron. he's a brilliant guy. it would have been a great shame if he was just a monster. and he's often right, when he talks about the irony of americans lecturing the vietnamese about human rights, or pakistan talking about genocide in kashmir. fiction is play, which is what i enjoy. the ability to be whimsical, to look into the same room or building through different windows. i also like that fiction demands commitment, demands time, to read as well as write. in this climate of -- what can i say -- plummeting iq. i mean is it a national project to keep our iq down at a certain level? if you do love this country keep the iq up, what are we trying to do? anyway, in this moment when everything has a news cycle which lasts a few hours, it's a radical thing to do something that took 10 years.when you say 'radical', i think also of all the images in the book. the one of the abandoned baby, say. it's a kind of profane nativity scene. the novel seems deeply attached to profanity, makes a point of it. would you say you have a profane way of looking at the world?what is seen by people as profane, i don't see as profane. i think it's beautiful. a little black girl who is the child of what she is the child of (spoiler alert: the child is the product of state rape, if you like)... that's not profane, it is beautiful, it's asking you to question what is profane. there's a cool, hard way of being profane. this is not it.of course... it's not hard-boiled, cynical fiction. it's the opposite of...this is telling you to look at hope that might come from somewhere else.your allegiance has always been to weakness, or rather the oppressed...for the marginal, for the forcibly marginalised which is not necessarily weakness. what is this society that we live in where everybody is a walking barcode, where your name alone provides all the information people need to categorise you, classify you? this grid that is so shallow... the novel invites you to shrug all that off, to live with people who transgress so deeply that the grid does not apply.it's interesting that you use the word grid because some of the criticism around something like aadhar is how hard it is going to be in the future to get off the grid...it's so ironic isn't it that for 20 years you gave kashmiris a number, id, etc for checkposts and now you're giving it to yourself. you're policing yourself in so many ways.your critics have been urging you to get back to fiction. they might regret it...(laughs)what about the indian media's apparent willingness to do the bidding of the state?people who don't understand how the media works structurally might just be angry with individual journalists. good senior journalists are the most endangered; the better you are at your job the less chance you have of surviving. it's not like that in any other profession. i don't watch tv news. recently i saw the exorcist on one of the movie channels and when i watch the news on tv i can literally see all the green stuff, the bile, coming out of the screen. there's something terribly sick that's happening and we need exorcists not analysts. almost all the media's economic turnover comes from advertising. the ownership... well, we know what it is. so how can it be otherwise?you're reliant on the poorest people to fight for their rights while the media runs scared...yeah... they're there, in the forest with their guns, or in kashmir. so much of the anger against me is 'we can't control this person'. i have a voice, my book is being published in 29 countries and they're tearing their hair out, asking 'how can we snuff it out?'do you feel, with all the contempt for you, even in the media, that you're no longer listened to in india?it feels like the opposite, to be honest. the people who make all the noise, they have no idea. every single political essay has been translated, made into pamphlets. when i go to punjab, or somewhere, to speak, thousands of people show up. the media is so busy with its own noise. but why would the media get so hyper about someone like me, why would they feel so threatened? they're anxious, otherwise they'd just ignore me. all the hysteria that's built up over fake news and lies... it's easy for me, but other people die because of it, all the lynchings that happen because of rumour. there's an outsourcing of censorship to the mob. i'm not beholden to anyone; i live off my royalties. i have circles of solidarity around me because of what i have written. but for other people who have to face it alone, face intimidation, to go to court wherever some trumped up charge is filed, they can't cope so they just stop. that's how they wear critics down. look at what they did to those kids (jnu), faking soundtracks...what is your sense of how india has changed in the 20 years since you wrote god of small things?massacres are not new. today (may 23, when the interview was done) is the day after the 30th anniversary of hashimpura (where over 40 young muslim men were rounded up and allegedly killed by police). the massacre of sikhs in 1984 was as heinous as the massacre of muslims in gujarat in 2002, there's no doubt about that. but the question is was there an ideology into which that massacre dovetailed? today you have a population living in absolute terror, the mobs are on the loose. there's a lynching a day to keep everyone in fear. the acceptance of a particularly ugly form of public discourse began with the nuclear tests (1998). it changed something.did nationalism become more overt, more acceptable because of the nuclear tests?the violence of inclusion, the violence of exclusion... the silencing of people, the changing of history. if you love this country, you must recognise that the national iq is dropping faster than the water table.what do you hold on to, what do you still love about india?it's all in the book. every day i wake up and i could just burst out laughing at what i see that day. i love the anarchy. i love the creatures that we have on the streets, the untamedness. i love this city (delhi), even with the pollution. i love the music, the layers of poetry, history, all of it. i love the wisdom of the resistance movements. i'm of this place. and the people who say i don't love india know nothing about the india i love. their india is built on a manifesto of hatred and exclusion. to me even the language in which i write is informed by what i hear around me. it's polyphonic and deeply rooted here.also readparesh rawal wants arundhati roy to be tied to army jeep instead of stone pelter",0.09097482526969708,terrifying write world everything shredded tweets : arundhati roy upcoming novel,"hijras novel live parallel world call ' duniya ' . seems bit like fiction , draws real world , ' duniya ' , entire world unto ' reality ' .the way feel , even way live , covers. look underneath , look side , look way , whole world. hard , increasingly hardening , definition ' reality ' , ' majority ' , ' identity.

2017-06-07,"beef ban: plea challenges centre order in sc, says it would lead to increase in cow vigilantism","supreme court will hear a plea challenging centre's notification regarding ban on sale and purchase of cattle for slaughter at animal markets on june 15.a vacation bench of justice ashok bhushan and justice deepak gupta directed the listing of the matter on june 15 as counsel sanobar ali qureshi, appearing for petitioner mohammed abdul faheem qureshi, mentioned the matter for an early hearing.counsel qureshi told the bench that the centre's notification was contrary to the provision of law that permitted the sale of animals for religious sacrifices.the plea argues that the centre's notification indirectly imposes a ban on sale, purchase or resale of animals, and this would further cast a huge economic burden on the farmers and cattle traders.the plea also argues that the rules will lead to further instances of cow vigilantism and more harassment of farmers and cattle traders.earlier, the madras high court ordered a month-long stay on the centre's ban on cattle sale for slaughter while the kerala high court said there was no need for it to interfere with the new rules as they did not violate the constitution.protests against beef banthe centre's notification regulating cattle trade has met with opposition in several parts of the country.west bengal chief minister mamata banerjee called the rule banning sale of cattle for slaughter a ""deliberate attempt to encroach on the state's powers and destroy the federal structure"", and said her government would challenge it legally.kerala chief minister pinayari vijayan wrote to the centre calling the notification ""against the principles of secularism and federalism enshrined in our constitution"".what the notification saysthe union ministry of environment, forests and climate change (moefcc) notified the new rules under the prevention of cruelty to animals act, which bans sale of cattle for slaughter in open markets across the country.a gazette notification, titled prevention of cruelty to animals (regulation of livestock markets) rules, 2017 by the union ministry, states that no one can bring cattle to an animal market unless he or she has furnished a written declaration that the cattle will not be sold for the purpose of slaughter.upon sale of cattle, the animal market committee will take an ""undertaking"" that the animals are for agricultural purposes and not for slaughter.what the bjp saysrecently, two bjp leaders from meghalaya quit the party to protest

2017-07-09,how fake photos became a part of the bjp's social media narrative,"pm narendra modi's internet presence and persona has made him the second most followed politician on twitter. as a result, bjp and its supporters sometimes overstep their freedom to use the internet and share photos and news without confirming the sources.in the past, fake, photoshopped images have been shared that led to the spread of fake news and violence in some cases, while some images are just used to portray modi as the one true leader of india. chandigarh stalking incident, where a woman -- varnika kundu -- accused vikas barala, son of haryana bjp chief subhash barala, and his friend of stalking her in the streets of chandigarh on august 5 midnight, has become the talk of the town. kundu chose to speak up against the bjp chief's son, filed a complaint following which barala and his friend was arrested. they were soon let off on bail as the cops dropped two non-bailable charges initially registered against them. kundu's father, virender kundu, an ias officer, made the family's stand clear through a facebook post saying they will fight till they get justice. meanwhile, there has been an attempt on social media to malign varnika's character by using photos of her, some with male friends and some that shows she drinks, with an intent to say that she asked for it.earlier, the arrest of a man for sharing the still of a bhojpuri film as a photo of the basirhat violence in bengal has once again brought into spotlight the use of fake images and videos. the same image was also shared by bjp haryana leader vijeta malik who, along with the photo, commented on the worrying state of hindus in bengal.here is a look at some of the fake photos shared and spread by bjp leaders and supporters:victim-shaming in chandigarh stalking case resorting to victim-shaming when women choose to report crimes is common in india. a supreme court advocate tweeted, ""so called victim daughter of ias from chandigarh with vikas barala. this story is as true as like jasleen kaur of delhi & of rohtak sisters"", along with a photo of varnika with two of her friends.shaina nc, maharashtra bjp's treasurer and spokesperson, lifted and shared the photo the advocate shared, and along with the image, lifted his words too.she then claimed that her twitter account was hacked and requested all to ignore the tweets from her handle. twitter users believe her account was not hacked and that her claim was just a damage-control attempt.photo of old man used during gorkhaland violencein june 2017, an image of an old man with blood all over his face was shared all over social media 'alleging' that the old man was attacked during the violence in darjeeling. the image is used to raise dissent

posted by surendran, corpses of cows are seen lying on the side of the road.here is a close translation of what surendran said in his facebook post: ""the state government should immediately take necessary measures to curb beef festivals organised across the state by youth organisations affiliated to the left, the congress and certain ""terrorist"" organisations. beef distributed during these festivals are not purchased from legal slaughter houses and in many places cattle is being slaughtered in public, openly flouting the law. such incidents instill fear in common people and make them uncomfortable and is being done to provoke people. anti-social elements and ""terrorists"" are taking advantage of the current scenario. devaswom minister consuming cow meat in public has hurt the sentiments of many people. ministers and responsible social workers should distance themselves from such horrific protests. people have the right to protest, but it will be better for all if people behind such protests refrain themselves. i request everyone involved not to force nationalistic organisations to counter this.""in reality, that photo was not from kerala. the photo posted by surendran was cropped, but the real photograph found on the internet showed the boards in the background. the names of the shops are written in bangla, which clearly means that the photo is either

2018-07-27,fact check: did mughals ban cow slaughter?,"rajasthan bjp chief madan lal saini is being trolled online for a history mix-up.saini claimed that when mughal emperor humayun was on his deathbed, he told his father babur to respect the cows, brahmins and women to be able to rule hindustan.he is being mocked and reminded that it was babur who died first and not humayun.humayun passed 25 years later in 1556.but did the bjp leader get the history wrong?india today's fact check team dug out mughal memoirs to study their policy on cow slaughter.historians say saini might have quoted from a 17th century book described as babur's ""wasaya"" or will. according to the experts, it does talk about babur cautioning his son about cow slaughter. but then, there's a caveat: the book is forged. cow in baburnamababur and humayun existed in the 16th century while the so-called ""wasaya"" came during shah jehan's reign, historians say.experts suggest that the book could have been floated to lend greater power to calls for a total ban on cow slaughter by suggesting that the prohibition was enforced even during the early mughal rule.according to historians, babur's biography, tuzuk-i-baburi, has no reference to cow slaughter. babur's biography tuzuk-i-baburiit only mentions that the cow is considered a sacred animal in india. it's not therefore clear whether the mughal emperor banned cow slaughter altogether.the reign of babur's son, humayun, was tumultuous. there is no direct allusion to cow slaughter in humayun's biography, humayun nama, either.however, a book titled tezkereh-al-vakiat written by jouher, a secret domestic of the emperor, contains private memoirs of the royalty. later translated by major charles stewart of the british east india company, tezkereh-al-vakiat does throw light on the cow question. tezkereh-al-vakiat written by jouherjouher has cited an incident which reveals humayun apparently opposed cow slaughter. after driving out his rebellious brother kamran from kabul city, states the book, humayun was offered beef for supper. but the emperor refused to eat it, according to tezkereh-al-vakiat.oh unfortunate kamran! was this the mode of your existence? and did you feed the asylum of chastity on the flesh of cows? ...this is not a fit food even for the devout persons who wait on the tomb of our father. could not we, his four sons, support his relict as he did?- it quotes humayun as sayingthough historians doubt translation capabilities of the british officer, there is enough hint that the early mughal emperors were averse to cow slaughter for beef.during akbar's reign, there was a strict ban on cow slaughter. this was followed by his son jehangir and then shah jehan as well.it is well known that emperor aurangzeb followed a hard line against hindus. in his book, faiths across time: 5,000 years of religious history, author j gordon melton has written that aurangzeb, as a price, desecrated a jain temple and had a cow to be killed on the sacred premises.experts, however, doubt that aurangzeb would have lifted the ban on cow slaughter enforced by his predecessors.even during later mughal period, there are documented references about the ban.during emperor farrukhsiyar's rule, for instance, there is documentary evidence of a royal trial over accusations of cow slaughter.there are references though that the ban would be relaxed during bakr id.from our fact check, it's clear that the bjp leader was factually incorrect by quoting a forged document. at the same time, it is an established fact that cow slaughter during mughal period was a strict no.if you have a story that looks suspicious, please share with us at factcheck@intoday.com or send us a message on the whatsapp number 73 7000 7000",-0.0386111111111111,fact check : mughals ban cow slaughter ?,"rajasthan bjp chief madan lal saini trolled online history mix-up.saini claimed mughal emperor humayun deathbed , told father babur respect cows , brahmins women able rule hindustan.he mocked reminded babur died first humayun.humayun passed 25 years later 1556.but bjp leader get history wrong?india today ' fact check team dug mughal memoirs study policy cow slaughter.historians say saini might quoted 17th century book described babur ' "" wasaya "" will. according experts , talk babur cautioning son cow slaughter. , ' caveat : book forged. cow baburnamababur humayun existed 16th century so-called "" wasaya "" came shah jehan ' reign , historians say.experts suggest book could floated lend greater power calls total ban cow slaughter suggesting prohibition enforced even early mughal rule.according historians , babur ' biography , tuzuk-i-baburi , reference cow slaughter. babur ' biography tuzuk-i-baburiit mentions cow considered sacred animal india.
