2009-05-02,"criminals, crorepatis galore in up poll arena","politics in uttar pradesh always has the reputation of being driven by guns and money power. and the current elections are no different in

2011-10-01,bjp call to close ranks after congress spectacle,"the extensive damage to the congress on account of internal dissensions seems to have alarmed the bjp about the political impact of its own divided house.worried over gujarat chief minister narendra modi and former karnataka chief minister b. s. yeddyurappa's public display of defiance, the bjp brass on saturday called for unity among its ranks.as the saffron party's two-day national executive meeting came to a close this afternoon, bjp seniors tried to drill in the virtues of putting up a united front as, they asserted, a mid-term poll could not be ruled out given the present political situation.sushma swaraj, leader of opposition in the lok sabha, said: ""we should learn from congress's mistakes. the party should stay united and take the allies along.""other senior leaders like l. k. advani and party president nitin gadkari also stressed on the need to present a united front.asked if swaraj's comment should be viewed in the light of dissensions within the bjp, arun jaitley, leader of opposition in the rajya sabha, said: ""(this) assessment is not entirely wrong.""the bjp's joint family is clearly not so happy with feuds erupting intermittently among rivals for the top job - arun jaitley, sushma swaraj and narendra modi. the latest is the tiff between modi and the rest, including l. k. advani and nitin gadkari, because of their decision to invite bihar cm nitish kumar, the man who publicly snubbed modi by refusing to accept his offer for flood relief, to flag off advani's anti-corruption yatra. the party tried hard to play down the differences. ""there is no such issue? all party leaders talk about unity and keeping a clean image,"" jaitley said.despite these proclamations of unity, the party was at a loss of words over the absence of its regional satraps - modi, yeddyurappa and ramesh pokhriyal nishank. in what could have been a pointed attack on the government, the bjp meet was overshadowed by these power imbalances within the party.while modi and yeddyurappa were still sulking, former uttarakhand cm nishank turned up at the meet on saturday. he was miffed after he was replaced by b. c. khanduri. he was, however, placated by being appointed as the party's national vice-president this afternoon.but both modi and yeddyurappa did not turn up in spite of the party rule that if a member of the national executive was not attending its meeting, he could only do it with prior permission of the president. this rule obviously does not apply to modi. in fact, far from being in the position of granting permission to modi to skip the meeting, gadkari had appealed to him to attend it. ""we are talking to him. there are some issues due to the navratra,"" he had said a day before the meeting was to start.by not attending the meet modi proved two points. one, that he was above the others in the bjp. two, that he was displeased with certain events that took place despite his disapproval. modi's displeasure was over gadkari's induction of his bte noire sanjay joshi as election manager for uttar pradesh and the invitation extended to nitish to flag off advani's yatra. yeddyurappa has been sulking since he was made to resign after his indictment by the karnataka lokayukta.the bjp had to act against yeddyurappa and nishank if the party was to take on the congress on an anti-graft plank. yeddyurappa has since been asked not to be present on the same dais as advani during the karnataka leg of the latter's yatra. but more than him, it is modi's absence that has the bjp worried.""modi had told advani to start his yatra from bihar and not gujarat. he had also suggested that he should call all bjp cms and ask him to flag off the yatra. this would have been a slap on nitish's face. but instead of doing that, the bihar cm was invited to flag off the yatra. the other reason for him not turning up was induction of his detractor joshi as organisation in- charge of up elections,"" confirmed a bjp source.and to make matters worse, joshi was present at the meeting. so was uma bharti, who has also joined the bjp campaign in up.in this backdrop, the bjp tried to present a picture of bonhomie. advani lavished praise on swaraj for her apparently brilliant oratory.""i always had a complex speaking after atal bihari vajpayee, as he was such a good speaker. after listening to sushma ji , i felt the same today,"" advani said. earlier on friday, gadkari had heaped generous praise on advani.the bjp impressed upon its other leaders the need to present a ""one-happy-family picture"" to the people - a trait that would apparently take the party closer to realising its political dream.taking the first tentative steps towards success, the party on saturday reviewed its preparations in poll- bound up, uttarakhand, punjab, goa and manipur. for the party, the mid- term polls may soon be a reality. so, it is offering a sanguine assessment of results to rejuvenate its cadres.advani told his partymen: ""the government is in suicidal mode. and we need not disturb it at all,"" referring to the pm's statement that the opposition was trying to destabilise the government.mocking at salman khurshid quoting a famous punchline from the movie three idiots during the famous pranab mukherjee- p. chidambaram patch-up, advani said: ""a upa minister said 'all is well' referring to the patch-up between pranab mukherjee and p. chidambaram. a reporter asked him who are the 'three idiots' then?""jaitley attacked the government saying its style of governance was marked by arrogance and intolerance.

or is it that they want to misuse cbi to save corrupt ministers? or is it you want to misuse cbi to ensure that the government does not fall by ensuring support of yadav and mayawati,"" he asked.hazare alleged that singh's government did not listen to voices of people on lokpal but was quick to address the concerns raised by gandhi.in the letter to gandhi, team anna said the government did not honour the commitment of parliament but when he demanded constitutional status for the ombudsman it readily listened.""it looks like that the government listens to you only. the moment you asked, they gave it. but you don't want to give lokpal any freedom or strength,"" they said.countering gandhi's argument that the lokpal bill is strong, they said, ""tell us with your hands on your heart, do you think that it is strong?

2012-02-29,cadre-less cong banks on gandhis' charisma in up elections,"on february 11, rahul gandhi's helicopter landed at soraon district near allahabad to a resounding welcome. ""up ka bhavishya aaya hai (the future of uttar pradesh is here),"" said an excited compere as local congress leaders pegged the crowd as 10,000 strong. this seemed probable. some had travelled four hours to hear rahul speak.but the show was over the minute the congress general secretary left. the crowd dispersed immediately, as did the sundry leaders who had been preening on the dais. allahabad went to polls on february 15. four days after rahul's successful rally, the mood in soraon had changed. ""rahulji ki baat alag hai (rahul is different). we have no problem with him. but he is at the centre, our work is with the local mla,"" said a youth who had attended the rally, clapped for him but voted for the samajwadi party (sp) candidate satyaveer munna. according to the locals, the vote here is a fight between the bahujan samaj party (bsp), sp and the bjp. the standing mla is from the bsp.the inability to convert crowds at rahul's rallies into voters is a glaring deficit in the congress campaign. rahul has tried to make up for the lack of a cadre by deploying youth congress workers from all over india. but they still retain the tag of outsiders; as does rahul himself. the congress has not had a charismatic state leader since n.d. tiwari. ""i wanted rahulji to be projected as chief minister. i suggested this but was told he has to be prime minister. had we done so, we would have been sure of a thumping majority,"" says chaudhary jitender nath singh, allahabad mayor and the congress candidate from allahabad south assembly constituency.in 2007, bsp won eight of the then 11 seats in allahabad, sp, bjp and the congress picking up one each. now the fight seems to be largely between sp and bsp, with the former having an edge in rural pockets. as a farmer in mansurabad village near allahabad says, ""mayawati did little for farmers. mulayam (singh yadav, sp chief) and rajnath singh (bjp) helped us. it looks as if sp is winning, so we voted for mulayam.""in the amethi-rae bareli belt, the gandhi charisma still has an impact. both sonia gandhi and rahul are mps from here. during the 2007 assembly elections, the congress won seven out of the 10 seats from these two parliamentary constituencies. in other words, one-third of the congress total of 22 mlas came from here. priyanka gandhi has been camping here but, for the first time, even she had to face accusations of being a poll tourist instead of insider. slowly, the gandhi family is acquiring the aura of absentee-landlords. rahul tried to placate his constituency in the one rally that he held at gauriganj in amethi. ""yahan mera ghar hai, mera pyar hain (my house is here, i got love here),"" he said. he has reciprocated some of the love: all the national highways in and around his constituency are tarred.although there are complaints of disconnect between the vip mps and the locals, the vote here is still in favour of the congress. late bjp leader pramod mahajan once recalled that after seeing the neglect in former prime minister chandra shekhar's constituency in ballia, he had asked the people why they still elected him time and again. ""kya karein, apne hai (what to do, he is ours),"" is the reply he got. it is this same goodwill that is working for the gandhi family. this allows priyanka to placate a woman worker protesting against the shutdown of a local garment factory simply by pulling her cheeks.a villager in gauriganj still remembers how the late rajiv gandhi had visited his hut and had tea with him. ""abki baar nahin jeetenge toh phir rahul ka chance nikal jayega (if he does not win this time, rahul will lose his chance),"" he says. union minister and congress mp from dhaurahra jitin prasada scoffs at this. ""even in 2002, the media had said it was 'make or break' for rahul. and what about the 2009 lok sabha elections? wasn't that a 'make'?"" he asks. in 2009, the congress won 21 lok sabha seats while sp got 23 and bsp 20.the problem for the congress is that the minute you leave amethi and rae bareli, the party cadre also vanishes. in neighbouring sultanpur and pratapgarh, local mps are from the congress but the assembly strength is limited to congress legislature party leader pramod tiwari's constituency, pratapgarh khas. neither is tiwari capable of helping anyone else win a seat.""we will definitely increase our vote share,"" says a party mp, pointing out that if the congress won one seat in every district, it will have a minimum of 74 seats. ""hum izzat ki ladai ladh rahe hain (we are fighting with dignity),"" says surendra rajput, a party leader from lucknow, pointing out that since the elections were announced rahul has held 125-126 sabhas (meetings). ""even if you take a bare minimum of 8,000 people at each meeting, at least 32,000 people hear him everyday,"" he adds.after a 22-year absence, rahul and his chief aide digvijaya singh have ensured that the congress is once again part of the uttar pradesh poll rhetoric. but when party leaders start talking about vote percentages instead of seats, then you know that expectations are being managed. there is a banner put up by a congress candidate in the heart of hazratganj in lucknow which says 'dilli rahi hamaari hai, ab up ki baari hai (delhi is ours, now it is uttar pradesh's turn)'. it is clearly easier for the congress to rule in delhi than to wrest control of uttar pradesh.",0.10776643990929703,cadre-less cong banks gandhis ' charisma elections,"february 11 , rahul gandhi ' helicopter landed soraon district near allahabad resounding welcome.

2013-01-26,all the king's men: meet rahul gandhi's a-team,"the churning has begun. with rahul gandhi at the helm, the grand old party has started slowly gearing towards the general elections. the possibilities for change with him around are immense but it also comes with an unscripted roadmap giving anxious moments to old war horses and party veterans. most of them want to have a fresh lease of political life by jumping into his team. but the leader has kept them guessing. the big political team has not been formalised. the indications are that it will be done slowly and over a period of time, though one thing is clear, he intends to shake the system, if not suddenly then slowly. it is this sense of change which is breeding a winter of discontent in delhi.the change is dynastic and in your face, but one will have to live with it. the not-so-young gandhi is here to stay with his loyal friends and chosen few and intends to turn around the party for good or worse. his views will impact the party and the government directly, and steer big ticket decisions. the long and short of his elevation is that he is expected to give the green signal to most of the big ticket initiatives of manmohan singh's government on which the old guard was dithering. be it petroleum sector or economic initiatives, rahul gandhi will allow the government to take tough decisions.then there will be chosen few who will have their influence in the system as they worked closely with rahul when he was cutting his teeth in congress politics as the general secretary. some will influence the decisions directly, and some indirectly. if sam pitroda was rajiv gandhi's choice then dr. mohan gopal is a lateral entrant in the system from rahul gandhi's stable. mohan gopal is part of the committee steering electoral strategy for 2014 and expected to provide academic insight into the political decisions. his name surprised many but reflects gandhi's approach towards politics where one can expect lot experts and outsiders to troop in with a specialised field of experience.though rahul has soothed frayed nerves by telling all the seniors at aicc that he would like to work with all of them, some will definitely hold his confidence more than others. the appointment will have to come through kanishka singh, and byju will be the point person for his outstation tours.digvijay singh will still be around as rahul's personal 'loud speaker' and men like krishna byre gowda and deepender hooda will hold special positions whenever he plans his tactical foray. but then rahul will have to deliver on what he says and also owe up to political mistakes he has committed. in his jaipur speech, rahul talked about his party's bad habit of allowing outsiders party tickets just before the elections.but when he steered the election campaign in up, he allowed outsiders to fight on congress symbol. from now on, his elbow room will be less as he will have no right to complaint or make the right noises about changing the system. the head cannot complaint or crib as he will be evaluated on delivery, and not on promise.deepender singh hoodadeepender singh hoodaa lok sabha mp from rohtak in haryana, he is the state chief minister bhupinder hooda's son. in gandhi's good books, he was one of the few congressmen allowed to accompany rahul gandhi during the bhatta-parsaul agitation in greater noida. sources confirm that he has been taking an interest in social media initiatives and is expected get an important role in the aicc reshuffle. hooda, who holds a business degree from the us, is considered down to earth and rooted. the last lok sabha session saw his debut as a good speaker on behalf of the party during the debate on fdi in retail.sachin raoanother resource person at gandhi's office, rao seldom travels with his boss but makes important interventions when it comes to social sector schemes, probably because the first time that rao met gandhi was when he was a member of the centre for civil society. a graduate of the michigan business school, he is also involved in internal surveys research and coordinates certain aspects of iyc and nsui with gandhi. not a frequent flyer between delhi and amethi unlike other members of gandhi's team, the only news snippet which surfaced about him was when gandhi nominated him for a refresher course in management at the hyderabad-based indian school of business(isb).digvijaya singhdigvijaya singhmany consider him to be rahul gandhi's political guru or mentor, but be that as it may, singh reflects the aggressive side of gandhi's politics. while gandhi made it quite clear to his close coterie that he considered the jan lokpal movement a tactical insertion into the democratic system, it was singh who took on anna hazare and arvind kejriwal in public. an important part of gandhi's strategic team, he continues to enjoy the new party vice president's trust despite the debacle of the 2012 assembly elections in up. he is expected to play an important role in the run up to the next general elections.meenakshi natarajanmeenakshi natarajanlok sabha mp from mandsaur in madhya pradesh, the austere natarajan is quite a favourite with rahul, and he frequently cites her example as someone who has made a success of a political career despite not having a pedigree for it. a firm no-nonsense person, she has her set of rules. she doesn't speak on saturdays and takes public transport, even to the parliament. she is expected to play a larger role in the parent body set up after aicc reshuffle.harish chaudharya relatively new entrant in rahul's team, chaudhary is lok sabha mp from barmer in rajasthan. again maintaining the low profile so desperately required of all those who are part of the rahul's team, he worked closely with digvijay singh during the uttar pradesh assembly elections in 2012. during the recently concluded chintin shivir of the party, held in jaipur, he ensured that mps enjoyed authentic rajasthani cuisine.ramakrishnanhe was part of the close protection unit of the spg guarding former prime minister rajiv gandhi. as he coordinates appointments and handles election time duty in rai bareli or amethi, ramakrishnan dons many hats in gandhi's team. he has the dubious distinction of having issued the official press release from gandhi's office during the robert vadra land deal controversy. his work is purely secretarial and rarely takes on a political hue.jitendra singhjitendra singhthis quiet mp from alwar in rajasthan has made steady progress in the hierarchy of gandhi's team. gandhi spotted him during an interaction with the mlas from rajasthan, and he quickly became an important part of the team. minister with independent charge for sports and youth affairs and minister of state for defence, singh is fond of photography, and prefers being called jts rather than by his royal title bhanwar jitendra singh.jairam rameshkanishka k singhminister for rural development, jairam ramesh is the spin doctor of the pack. his rise in the upa can be traced to his role in shaping the congress' campaign in 2004 and coining the slogan ""congress ka haath aam aadmi ke saath."" a rajya sabha mp from andhra pradesh, he is also expected to play a key role in not only shaping the direct cash transfer scheme as congress initiative for 2014 elections, but also marketing it as a winning idea. it is expected that like in 2009, once lok sabha elections draw close jairam ramesh once again will quit the government to work for the party.kanishka 'k' singhjairam rameshknown as 'k' in political circles, he is the unnamed chief of staff in rahul gandhi's establishment 12 tughlak lane. son of the late foreign secretary s.k. singh, kanishka was educated at st. stephens and wharton, an ivy league training for the hurly burly of domestic politics. he cut his political teeth when he worked with delhi's chief minister sheila dikshit during 2003 assembly elections. there on he made a shift to rahul's office. he is present at every meeting, listening, recording, and processing ideas and discussions. from driving gandhi on his tours to coordinating appointments and giving policy inputs, there is nothing singh won't do in his ubiquitous role. tech savvy singh, on less politically turbulent days, can be spotted browsing for book's at delhi's khan market.k. b. byjuthis former spg sharpshooter quit the force three years ago after almost a decade of providing close protection for the gandhi family, to take a plunge into domestic politics. soft spoken and shy, his job is to coordinate tours with security and the party. during the 2012 up elections, he was on the road for more than 60 days as part of rahul's advance team. as an additional charge, he also takes care of the media, which, looking at his media shy boss, is quite a thankless job.",0.04927907647907648,king ' men : meet rahul gandhi ' a-team,"churning begun. rahul gandhi helm

months.padam singh served as the security officer of several chief ministers since 1985 to 2012, but his allegiance always remained towards mayawati and he was amply rewarded for it, when he got promoted to the rank of deputy superintendant of police. he had recently been in the media glare, when he was seen cleaning mayawati's shoes in a public meeting. padam singh alleged that the party had lost both its aim and its momentum now and has become a puppet in the hands of satish mishra.who will emerge the winner?considering how almost every major contender for the up chief minister's post is

satisfied they were with the government across 17 different parameters -- from the condition of local roads, electricity, drinking water, health facilities, education, law and order to employment opportunities.on an average, 59 per cent of the respondents expressed dissatisfaction with the sp administration over the last four-and-a-half years. less than one-third of the voters said they were

2017-01-24,punjab assembly election: how war rooms are being used by political parties to boost campaigning ,"the 2017 assembly elections have become a battle of prestige for all the political parties. while at one hand the shiromani akali dal (sad) and the bjp are burning midnight oil to come to power again, the congress is leaving no stone unturned to stage a comeback. the aam aadmi party (aap), which emerged as a third force in punjab during general elections, is also not far behind.there are 1,97,49,464 voters in punjab out of which 50 lakh are internet users. more than one crore (1.04 core) voters fall in the age group between 18-35, out of which 35 lakhs use internet. in other words, young voters will decide who will be the next sardar of punjab.to lure the voters, most of the political parties have set-up election war rooms to strike a chord with the voters. the war rooms are not only being used as a voter outreach tool but also to manage various campaigns, social media, conventional media including print, broadcast and television, data mining and on ground activities such as organising rallies, airing the events on social media and surveys.how an election war room helped the captain amrinder singh shed his 'maharaja' tag:the concept of election war room is new in punjab. it is the first time that the power of war rooms has been gauged and used to fortify the poll campaigns. the congress was the first party to launch its war room with a force of 450 people in mohali. within days its digital and offline campaign 'punjab da captain' was a big hit. this prompted the agency (hired by the party) to launch other initiatives like halke vich captain (captain in the constituency) or coffee with captain.these initiatives were primarily aimed at establishing a connect between the voters and the face of congress amrinder singh. although amrinder singh never met with the sections of voters before these initiatives, these initiatives lessened the communication gap. after the social media started off, he met students, girl students in particular, farmers, employees, ex-servicemen, industrialists, dalits, backward community and even the differenet religious heads.""this does not mean that captain never met people. he won amritsar ls polls with a huge margin before we established this war room. it is true that the strategies planned by the war room actually worked and he was able to meet more people during the past year,"" says payal kamat, member, indian political action committee (ipac), the agency that runs captain's war room.the congress election war room has been divided in four sections. one particular section with a team of 60 people monitors the social media including facebook pages, twitter handles and whatsapp. other sections handle a data centre, conventional media centre and an outdoor unit.""the war room has become an effective tool to manage and monitor the campaigns. it offers a 360 degree coverage and media management,"" says rishi raj singh, ipac member.sad's war room the sad, which is considered a traditional party and has been solely depending on a direct contact with voters till 2014 when aap punched holes into its vote bank, was prompted to launch its election war room when it realised that the rival aap used digital media campaigns to target it which also paid dividends.""we decided to establish our war room when we came to know that rivals were misusing social media against us. we realised the power of a high-tech war room,"" says manjinder singh sirsa, spokesperson of sad, who was initially hesitant to give us access to the party's war room.akali dal has employed nearly 80 people to manage its war room comprising various sections including video editing section, facebook, twitter and print media.social media bringing voters closer to parties political parties are banking on social media for voter outreach as it is free and easy. the congress has created facebook pages for each district of punjab and all the pages have been verified.while deputy chief minister sukhbir singh badal's facebook page has nearly 25 lakh likes, punjab da captain has been liked by over 9 lakh users. aap's punjab facebook page has been liked by 8.65 lakh users.aap mp from sangrur bhagwant mann and national convenor arvind kejriwal regularly interact with people via facebook lives or video messages.interestingly, the content uploaded on the social media pages is mostly in punjabi which are updated round the clock. the user generated content is also an integral part of social media campaigns. followers also contribute content in the form of photos, graphics and videos.""most of the internet users in punjab use facebook and whatsapp. we use punjabi language as it connects the non-resident punjabis with their land. this is most effective as it is available free,"" says paroma bhat, who manages social media at ipac.also read: delhi aam aadmi party workers launch smear

2017-01-31,"up election: samajwadi party-congress alliance closing gap with bjp, says india today-axis opinion poll","the political pendulum in india's most important battleground state has started shifting away from the bjp and towards the samajwadi party-congress alliance. where the pendulum rests will finally decide whether the bjp is able to cross the finishing line in the front or is trumped by the akhilesh-rahul combination.results of the final opinion poll done by axis-my-india for the india today group show that the bjp has lost about 25 seats in up between the previous opinion poll done in december and the latest one done in january. axis-my-india predicts that the bjp would bag between 180-191 seats if elections were held right now. the sp-congress alliance comes in a close second, bagging between 168-178 seats. the biggest loser as a result of this alliance has been the bahujan samaj party, which seems to have lost 40 seats between december and january.major changes in last one monththe last one month has seen significant changes in the vote-share percentages of major political formations. the bsp seems to have lost more than one-fifth of its votes, crashing from 26% vote share to 20.1%. the opinion poll numbers show that the congress allying with the samajwadi party has added more than 7% votes to the sp's vote percentage. the sp by itself had 26% votes. the sp-congress alliance is projected to bag 33.2% vote share. the bjp's own vote share has remained largely unaffected by the new alliance. in fact, the bjp's vote share is projected to go up from 33% in december to 34.8% in january.the election in up now is essentially a two-horse race between the bjp and the sp-cong alliance. in december, the bjp had more than a 100 seat lead over its nearest rival, the sp. but the akhilesh-rahul alliance has completely altered the political dynamics of up. even though the congress is a diminished force by itself, its partnership with the sp, has helped add 76 seats to the so-called secular alliance within a span of a month.also read: mulayam asks loyalists to file papers against congress in 105 uttar pradesh seats if the up elections were to be compared to a horse race, then the bjp stallion which was far ahead of the pack in december has started slowing down in january and the sp horse, aided by the booster doze provided by the congress, has started galloping significantly faster than earlier. the next few weeks will decide whether the bjp stallion be able to hold on to its diminishing lead or be overtaken in the last stretch by the surging challenger. currently, the vote-share gap between the two principal formations is down to less than 1.6%, which is already within the margin of error.up assembly election poll of pollsclick here to enlargea caveat that needs to be drawn while looking at these poll numbers is that the axis teams started their fieldwork from january 15 onwards. while there was a buzz at that time about an impending alliance, there was also some uncertainty, with frequent reports coming in of a breakdown in talks. the sp-congress alliance was finally announced on january 22. by then roughly 40% of the survey work by axis had already been completed.a study of the caste-wise data across the three axis tracking polls throws up interesting insights about how the poll arithmetic in up is changing. in the past one month, there has been a significant yadav and muslim consolidation in favour of the sp-congress alliance. in december 72% of the yadavs said they would vote for the sp. in january, that figure has gone up by 10% to 82%. the main reason for this is that half the yadavs who indicated that they would back the bjp in december have now switched loyalty to the sp.in december, 71% of the muslims said they would vote for the sp. that figure has increased even further to 74% in january. the alliance with the congress has also helped the sp bag 19% of the upper-caste vote. for the sp alone, in december, the figure of upper-caste supporters stood at a meagre 9%. meanwhile, the bsp seems to have lost support among all caste groups in the last one month.on the other hand, over the last one month there has been a consolidation of obc and upper caste votes in favour of the bjp. from 53%, the bjp's support among the obcs has gone up to 56%. among upper castes, the bjp's support

happens during the campaign over the next one month. as a counter to muslims and yadavs gravitating in greater numbers towards the sp-congress alliance, obcs and upper castes are already backing the bjp in greater numbers. hindu consolidation could increase further over the next one month. unlike bihar, up has a long history of communal consolidation, an experiment the bjp carried out successfully in the 2014 general elections. if communal tempers rise further through the course of the campaign then a strong hindu consolidation could help the bjp counter the caste arithmetic of team akhilesh and rahul.on the other hand, if the sp and congress run a strong campaign and pick candidates carefully, with the secular alliance fielding a significant number of upper-caste candidates, then the upper-caste consolidation in favour of the bjp can possibly be restricted because some of the upper-caste voters are likely to back the candidate of their community. the other big swing factor could be the dalit vote. so far the jatavs and non-jatavs both have sided with the bsp across the three axis tracking polls. but as word spreads of the bsp slipping, there is a possibility that some of the the non-jatavs especially could switch their voting preference. broadly speaking, currently the muslims and the yadavs are on the sp-congress' side and they are squaring

off against the upper castes and obcs who are siding with the bjp. where the dalit votes leans in the end could decide who wins the game of thrones in up.the battle for uttar pradesh is still open.

2017-02-08,uttar pradesh assembly election: bjp faces stiff opposition in western belt,"the jat dominated sugarcane belt of western up has traditionally been a lok dal stronghold. there has, however, been a steady erosion in the party's hold over the area in the last decade, as party's like the bsp, bjp have steadily increased their footprint in the area. in the 2014 lok sabha elections, the bjp riding the fallout of the muzaffarnagar riots swept uttar pradesh winning 73 of the 80 lok sabha seats.two and a half years later, the ground realities have changed. western up is witnessing a multi-corned contest that threatens to unshackle the stronghold that the bjp enjoyed over the area in the last elections. much of that owes itself to the disenchantment amongst the political dominant jats. in the lok sabha polls they had flocked almost enmass to the bjp, but for multiplicity of reasons, they are now beginning to rethink their support.the 73 seats that are going to the polls in the first round has a large concentration of jats, muslims and dalits in that order. each of these castes play a critical role in deciding the political fortunes of rival parties. since the emergence of the bsp, the dalits have voted for the party in election after election. the muslims have oscillated between the rld, sp, bsp and congress.jats unhappyjats appear to be unhappy over what they claim are a host of ""un-kept promises buy the bjp"" - unpaid sugarcane arrears, denial of reservation and then refusal to permit a memorial for jat icon charan singh in delhi. while there is little to suggest that the jats may have decided to switch enmass to the other side, travelling through jat strongholds like shamli, baghpat, meerut, muzaffarnagar and bulandshehar - it is difficult to miss their sense of disappointment with the central government and a discernible shift towards the opposition.also read: up election: all about the dialogues, drama and desperation as action begins the bjp has traditionally banked on the support of the upper castes, traders to add to the jat vote to provide it the cutting edge in the area. however, this time around, it finds its task cut out with its main support base of jats doing a rethink. the bsp appears to have tapped into this discontent by giving large number of tickets to muslims thereby hoping to put together a dalit muslim combination to put it past the others.however, one new factor that all political parties are having to contend with is the tilt of the young voter, between the age of 18 to 25 towards akhilesh yadav and the sp-congress alliance. across demographics and constituencies, young voters appear to have a distinct fondness for the young chief minister.all this and more will be put to test when voting takes place in the 15 western up districts on february 11.also read: up election: mood in lucknow favours samajwadi-congress alliance watch the video",-0.002786136627600048,uttar pradesh assembly election : bjp faces stiff opposition western belt,"jat dominated sugarcane belt western traditionally lok dal stronghold. , however , steady erosion party ' hold area last decade , party ' like bsp , bjp steadily increased footprint area. 2014 lok sabha elections , bjp riding fallout muzaffarnagar riots swept uttar pradesh winning 73 80 lok sabha seats.two half years later , ground realities changed. western witnessing multi-corned contest threatens unshackle stronghold bjp enjoyed area last elections. much owes disenchantment amongst political dominant jats. lok sabha polls flocked almost enmass bjp , multiplicity reasons , beginning rethink support.the 73 seats going polls first round large concentration jats , muslims dalits order. castes play critical role deciding political fortunes rival parties. since emergence bsp , dalits voted party election election. muslims oscillated rld , sp , bsp congress.jats unhappyjats appear unhappy claim host "" un-kept promises buy bjp "" -

2017-11-06,"demonetisation anniversary: will himachal, gujarat polls be another referendum on note ban?","come november 8 - the first anniversary of demonetisation initiative announced at 8 pm by prime minister narendra modi - the bjp-led nda government at the centre and the opposition alike have decided to observe the day to suit their own political agenda. while the opposition will observe november 8 as black day, the bjp has decided to counter it by celebrating the day as anti-black money day (kala dhan virodh diwas).with the voters in mind, while the bjp seeks to showcase demonetisation as one of the major achievements of the modi government in over three years of its term, the opposition is trying its best to discredit the government and harm it to the maximum.gujarat and himachal pradesh pollsperhaps demonetisation would not have been raked up with gusto by the rival parties but for the upcoming assembly elections in himachal pradesh and gujarat. the hilly state of uttarakhand goes to polls on november 9, just a day after the first anniversary of demonetisation move. the western state of gujarat faces election in two phases, on december 9 and 14, the first phase taking place a month after demonetisation's first anniversary.the opposition has sought to turn almost every election held after november 8 as a referendum on demonetisation. however, the bjp seems to have won most of them.the opposition has again linked note ban with the gujarat and himachal pradesh elections. with the economy slowing down and gst putting the traders to inconvenience, elections in these two states are the toughest challenge for the bjp post-demonetisation.if the bjp loses, the opposition including the congress will declare it as a referendum on demonetisation. otherwise, the bjp will once again claim that demonetisation has been a runaway success.the only issue remains whether the opposition will rake up demonetisation again in the 2018 assembly elections such as in karnataka, madhya pradesh, rajasthan, chhattisgarh and the 2019 lok sabha elections or the gujarat and uttarakhand assembly elections would settle the matter once and for all?the congress is in the forefront of the opposition parties' plan to protest demonetisation on november 8. with congress vice-president rahul gandhi already calling it a ""sad day"", the party plans to hold a number of activities to buttress their point.the uttar pradesh (up) unit of the congress has announced that it would hold a candlelight march to protest the demonetisation initiative. the unit will also submit a memorandum to the prime minister's office to demand compensation of rs 25 lakh and job to the next of kin of the people who lost their life during demonetisation.calling demonetisation as a ""scam"" which destroyed the country's economy, trinamool congress chief and west bengal chief minister mamata banerjee has exhorted twitterati to change their profile pictures to black as a mark of protest. in fact, she has taken the lead by already changing her own dp (display picture) on twitter.#noteban is a disaster. on #nov8blackday to protest against this scam that destroyed the economy, let us also change our twitter dp to black pic.twitter.com/yrhespize5- mamata banerjee (@mamataofficial) november 6, 2017when pm modi had announced the demonetisation initiative on november 8, the opposition had viewed it with scepticism. while banerjee had demanded its roll back, delhi chief minister arvind kejriwal had apprehended that the modi government's could lead to revolt by the people against the government. kejriwal gave a call to ""change pm, not notes"".bjp extols positive outcomethe bjp and its government have always stood their ground on the demonetisation move. the bjp has extolled the positive outcomes of note ban.while campaigning in himachal pradesh on sunday, pm modi said that over 3 lakh companies have shut down after demonetisation. a probe into 5,000 such firms has found a fraud of rs 4,000 crore even as investigation against others was still on.he said the congress was ""angry"" at demonetisation as it was still feeling its impact. he cited it as the reason for the party's protests. some people who faced the heat of demonetisation were still complaining and were planning to observe 8 november as 'black day', he added.finance minister arun jaitley has claimed that demonetisation has served all its three objectives - to squeeze cash economy, promote digital transactions in business and widen the tax base.bjp's claims notwithstanding, the jury is still out on the economic benefits of demonetisation. however, the bjp may have reasons to believe that note ban has so far helped it reap immense political dividends.a number of elections have taken place since the demonetisation drive was launched. and the bjp has won most of them. be they lok sabha and assembly bypolls, state, municipal and panchayat elections, the bjp has romped home victorious in majority of them.lok sabha and assembly bypollsby-elections to four lok sabha and eight assembly constituencies in six states and one union territory were held on november 19 last year, just 11 days after modi announced the demonetisation move. in the results which were announced on november 22, bjp and trinamool congress won two lok sabha seats each.in the assembly by-polls, bjp and aiadmk won three seats each, cpi(m) got two while congress and trinamool bagged one seat each.the bjp did not lose any lok sabha or assembly seat in these bypolls .assembly pollsthe bjp won up election by a three-fourths majority. up is the most populous state in the country with largely rural background. the impact of demonetisation was supposed to have adversely affected up the most.the other four states - uttarakhand, goa, manipur and punjab - which went to polls in february and march also felt the impact of note ban. while the bjp also won uttarakhand besides up, it came second in goa and manipur. however, it went on to form government in the last two states.the bjp was a junior partner in punjab and the previous government led by the shiromani akali dal (sad) was facing a massive anti-incumbency sentiment after 10 years of rule.the demonetisation initiative would have been listed as one of the most important reasons behind bjp's failure had the party lost up or fared poorly in the other states.however, the congress views the results in the assembly elections as a defeat for the bjp. p chidambaram told india today on a special programme demonetisation that the bjp won only up and uttarakhand. he said the bjp lost punjab while the congress was the single largest party in both goa and manipur.municipal pollsthe bjp registered a historic win in maharashtra municipal elections held in february. it won eight of the ten municipal corporations that went to polls. in brihanmumbai mumbai corporation (bmc), the richest and most prestigious corporation in the country, bjp improved its tally from 31 last time to 82 this year in a corporation of 227 seats. it was short of shiv sena by just two seats.in the maharashtra urban civic polls, the bjp's performance in the president council elections held on november 27, just 19 days after the demonetisation initiative, was also unprecedented. it emerged as the single largest party. it won more number of posts than it did the last time.the bjp's tally rose from 25 corporator seats in the previous election to 119. the congress, which had won 150 corporator seats last time, managed to take a lead on 126 seats, thus ceding ground to rival bjp.in maharashtra rural municipal polls, the bjp captured two municipalities and one taluka panchayat in local bodies elections, the results of which were declared on november 29. the bjp also maintained its lead on 23 out of 31 other seats of various municipalities, taluka and district panchayats, where by-polls were held.in the elections to the municipal corporation of delhi (mcd) too held in april this year, the bjp retained all the three bodies.panchayat pollsout of the 37 seats on which local bodies by-elections were held in rajasthan on november 29, 21 days after the demonetisation move, the ruling bjp won 19 seats while congress was victorious on 14 seats. in fact, the two parties gained one seat each in the by-polls held for panchayat and municipal seats in the state.in the panchayat elections held in february in odisha, bjp made unprecedented gains. of the total 853 seats, bjp bagged 306 seats - an increase of 8.5 times as compared with its tally of just 36 seats in 2012. it added 270 seats to its previous tally.on the other hand, ruling bjd won 460 seats as against its victory on 651 seats in 2012, losing 191. congress bagged just 66 seats against the 126 in the previous elections, losing 60.watch: gujarat opinion poll: results of the india today-axis my india opinion 2017 survey ",0.0689362674362674,"demonetisation anniversary : himachal , gujarat polls another referendum note ban ?","come november 8 -

2017-11-21, exposed: how black money is funding gujarat's high-stakes assembly polls,"promises of transparency and the ec's limits on campaign spending have fallen by the wayside in gujarat as an india today investigation found a dark sea of black money might be gushing through the state for next month's assembly elections. the ec has capped expenditure at rs 28 lakh for each candidate in the fray. leaders across the political spectrum have also repeatedly called for ""cleaner"" politics. but an undercover investigation by india today has unravelled a devastating reality -- political parties riding their luck on hawala cash for gujarat's high-stake battle. in their damning confessions caught on tape, some of the state's traditional diamond couriers called angadias have revealed how political groups have been using their well-entrenched network to route black money for campaign.who are angadias?tried and tested by diamond merchants, angadias have been ferrying gems between gujarat, mumbai and new delhi for generations. most of them, in fact, are the backbone of the industry. but several members of this system disclosed to india today how political parties have mobilized their chain to haul unaccounted funds ahead of gujarat elections. ahmedabad's v. patel angadia service, one of the state's leading hawala couriers, admitted that their business has multiplied during the current election season. ""cash consignments (we receive) increased from rs 2-3 lakh to rs 15-20 lakh (during this period),"" confessed hitesh bhai managing the v. patel angadia's office on ahmedabad's c.g. road. ""which means it's a turnover of crores every day?"" asked an india today reporter, posing as an agent of a political party. ""yes. this one-and-a-half-month period brings a windfall for us,"" hitesh bhai answered. deliveries of cash, he bragged, have remained undetected by authorities. ""we take this risk for higher profits. but all this has been incident-free so far,"" the angadia operative said. further, he disclosed that some angadia services have become the trusted hot-spot for corrupt politicians and bureaucrats for hiding their dirty money. ""both politicians and bureaucrats are aware (of what we do). they all park their money with angadias,"" said hitesh bhai, as he promised to deliver wads of currency notes to any corner of gujarat right up to the day before voting. ""we will ensure the money is delivered the next day. it will be delivered a day before (polling). we have done this business already,"" he claimed. ""whatever your money comes to me by the 7th (of dec), it will be delivered by the 8th to your destinations.""black money transfers some of gujarat's angadia operators offer solid guarantees for black money transfers, with modest fee in what appears to be a high-volume, low-margin model of business, india today's probe found. ""when you give us your money, it becomes my responsibility. if it is not delivered, you can take your cash back from me the very next day,"" hitesh bhai said. he quoted rs 1.5 lakh for delivery of rs 10 crore in hard cash to any part of gujarat. ""it will be distributed. whatever contact person you assign will get the cash,"" the angadia promised. bhupendra thakkar, an angadia at ahmedabad's r.c. enterprise, explained why no one ever gets caught. it's because they don't move cash physically, he revealed. after receiving consignments at one centre, their agents settle the deliveries at chosen destination from their own reserves of liquid assets, thakkar disclosed. ""the money will be arranged at whatever centre (district) you want to send the cash to. you will call me in two hours to inform whether your people have received the consignment in those centres (districts) or not,"" he explained. ""we officially commit ourselves to one hour for the deliveries. still, i am expanding it to two-and-a-half hours."" in surat, bhupendra bhai of the somabhai kanchallal angadia operation, divulged how political groups in delhi could organised cash deliveries in gujarat through bad eggs in the same multi-state network. charges for inter-state operations are higher though.

""yes, 50-50 crores are being spent there. the money went to lucknow when lucknow (up elections) happened. everything is hidden. you give it here today, it will be delivered tomorrow. give it here; take it from there. the matter ends,"" replied kannu bhai. he guaranteed anonymity without any burdensome paperwork for the illegal shipments. ashok bhai, another angadia at old delhi's chandni chowk, also confessed to sending hawala money to gujarat on a daily basis.

2017-12-28,"2017 in indian politics: bjp continues dominance, midnight dramas abound, 'neech' politics prove a distraction","there is never a dull moment in politics. especially so, when it is indian politics.2017 in indian politics saw the bharatiya janata party continue its electoral dominance even as india's grand old party, the congress, attempted a turnaround.there were also plenty of moments that surprised (the choice of chief minister in uttar pradesh), befuddled (a politician sitting on public meditation at midnight), and awed the electorate (a party's ability to win a state despite losing its election).here's recapping the year's top political moments:midnight meditation at marina around the turn of the year, all was (mostly) well in tamil nadu politics. yes, there was a power vacuum left behind by the death of j jayalalalithaa, the beloved tamil nadu chief minister and aiadmk supremo who died in december 2016.but, that vacuum was being filled pretty smoothly. ottakkarthevar panneerselvam, a long-time aiadmk loyalist, had replaced jayalalithaa as cm within hours of her death. and come january, amma's close aide vk sasikala was on the homestretch of a plan that would see her become cm.and as an apparent part of this plan, o panneerselvam resigned from the cm's post on february 5. pretty straight-forward politics, so far.it all changed on february 7 when panneerselvam made a late-night dash to jayalalithaa's memorial at marina beach and sat there on meditation. he did not utter a word even as curious onlookers, befuddled supporters and startled journalists gathered around.o panneerselvam at jayalalithaa's memorial on february 7 (pti)finally, after a 40-minute meditation session, panneerselvam awoke, said 'amma's soul had called out to him', and declared war on sasikala. he said he would ""continue to work in amma's name"" and take back his resignation if people were with him.the night pushed tamil nadu politics into turmoil. panneerselvam wasn't able to hold on the cm's chair (though he ultimately joined hands with his successor edappadi palaniswami and became deputy cm), nor was sasikala, thanks to a criminal conviction, able to become the chief minister.aiadmk still remains divided into warring factions and the state's politics saw a fresh twist this month when ttv dhinakaran, sasikala's nephew and part of the camp railing against the ops-eps combine, won the by-poll in rk nagar, the assembly seat vacated by late jayalalithaa.the man from gokrakhpur the political firestorm that followed the narendra modi government's shock demonetisation decision from november 2016 was very much raging in 2017. and in march, note ban, just one of the many expressions used to describe the invalidation of rs 500 and rs 1,000 notes, became an election issue in uttar pradesh.the ruling samajwadi party joined hands with the congress to take on the bharatiya janata party. unsuccessfully so. the bjp, led by the master campaigner narendra modi, won a staggering three-fourths majority in lucknow.the bjp won a landslide victory in the uttar pradesh election (indiatoday.in)click here to enlargethe biggest surprise of the election was what happened after the results were announced: the appointment of yogi adityanath, a firebrand saffron leader and a four-time mp from gorakhpur, as chief minister.adityanath's becoming uttar pradesh cm was widely critiqued by commentators, both positively and otherwise, and his decisions as chief minister were intensely scrutinised.fast-moving bjp catches congress coldif uttar pradesh was the headline of the five-state assembly elections from march this year, then manipur and goa were its post-scripts. of the five states, the bjp won in two (up and uttrakhand), lost in one (punjab) and finished second in the remaining.in goa and manipur, neither of which gave a majority to a single party, the congress won the most number of seats. however, it was the bjp that ended up forming governments in both the states, and ending with 4-1 tally in the five-state polls.once the results were announced on march 11, the bjp moved quickly to stitch up alliances with local parties and - the very next day -announced it had enough numbers to form governments in both the states.the bjp came second in goa and manipur, but still managed to form governments in both the states (ap)pm modi sacrificed his defence minister - manohar parrikar - so that he could return to his home state goa as chief minister (a condition alliance partners in the coastal state put forth for their support) while in manipur the party managed to secure the backing of two independent mlas, a tmc legislator and even a congress defector.the congress claimed the bjp had used money power to 'steal' the two states, but it is worth noting that while saffron party had vote share in goa and manipur even though it ended up fewer seats than the grand old party.mahagathbandhan no more on july 26 evening, bihar chief minister nitish kumar resigned from his post. the next day morning - barely over 12 hours after he resigned - nitish was at bihar's raj bhavan taking the oath of office, once again, to become the state's chief minister, once again.the hours between saw the spectacular end of the 'mahagathbandhan', a grand alliance starring nitish's janata dal (united) (jdu) and lalu prasad yadav's rashtriya janata dal, and the bihar cm's return to the nda fold.nitish's july 26 evening resignation, a result of his discontent over allegations of corruption against his deputy and lalu's son tejashwi, was followed by a series of 'coincidences'.moments after he announced his decision to step down, the bjp, which just happened to be holding a parliamentary meeting in new delhi, announced it would support the jd (u) in bihar. soon after, mlas of the two parties managed a late-night meeting in patna and signed letters of approval backing nitish's return to the cm's chair.2017 saw nitish kumar's return to the nda fold (reuters)in between, pm modi, on twitter, praised nitish for ""joining the fight against corruption"", nitish replied with a thank you and the rjd raged. tejashwi, left to hold the fort with father lalu having to (coincidently) travel to ranchi for a court hearing, even embarked on a post-midnight march to raj bhavan in protest of the developments. but, it all came to naught. nitish was sworn in as chief minster on july 27 and on july 28, won an assembly floor test, bringing about the end of the mahagathbandhan that just two years earlier had handed the bjp a humiliating defeat in the 2015 bihar election.election at midnight this was the third major political moment of the year for which journalists and writers liberally - and justifiably - used the phrase 'midnight drama'. the usually dull rajya sabha elections were an electric, nail-biting affair in gujarat this year, with results for the polls coming only after midnight on august 8.as polling began on august 8, congress' ahmed patel needed the support of 45 mlas to win. and, the congress had 51 mlas in the gujarat assembly.however, thanks to cross-voting, patel apparently managed the support of just 44 mlas, one short of the number required to win his re-election.and so, as day turned into night, the congress went to the mattresses. counting was held up for six hours as the election commission office in new delhi was besieged by delegations from the congress and the bjp.the grand old party alleged two of its mlas had broken voting rules by showing their ballots to bjp chief amit shah and union minister smriti irani (the two were contesting the other gujarat rajya sabha seats which they won comfortably). the bjp, on the other hand, wanted the poll panel to get on with the counting.finally, close to midnight the election commission ruled in favour of the congress and disqualified the votes of the two mlas in the question. this brought the number needed to win down to 44, which meant that nearly at 1.53 am august 9, ahmed patel was able to tweet this:this is not just my victory. it is a defeat of the most blatant use of money power,muscle power and abuse of state machinery- ahmed patel (@ahmedpatel) august 8, 2017of pakistan and 'low-life'more than a 'top moment' this marked a low for indian politics in 2017. in the heat of the gujarat assembly election, political attacks turned ugly and below-the-belt comments were common.the two incidents that stood out for how they dominated the popular discourse were mani shankar aiyar's 'neech kisam ka aadmi' comment and prime minister modi's insinuation that ex-pm manmohan singh conspired with pakistani diplomats and officials to influence the gujarat election.aiyar's comment, directed at pm modi, saw him lose the primary membership of his party, the congress. his clarification (that he hadn't called the pm a 'low-born') and half-apology notwithstanding, pm modi went to town using the comment to corner the congress during his election rallies.at one of these rallies, while talking about the aiyar comment, pm modi suggested that ex-pm singh and former vice president hamid ansari secretly met with some pakistani officials at aiyar's residence in new delhi before the gujarat polls.the congress took umbrage at the pm's suggestion and the controversy continued even ar the gujarat election results, with the grand old party disrupting parliament over its demand that the prime minister apologise for his remarks.the impasse finally ended days before new year's eve, with finance minister arun jaitley saying the government does not question singh's or ansari's commitment to the nation and that it holds the former pm in high regard. the congress, in response, disavowed of any attacks that may have been made on pm modi, which was seen as a reference to aiyar's 'neech' remarks.honourable mentionsthe verdict in the 2g spectrum scam case was a shocker for many. in maharashtra, the shiv sena has announced plans to quit the state-level alliance with the bjp in the coming year.the supreme court, in january 2017 delivered a crucial judgement that held that political parties and politicians cannot seek votes in the name of caste, community, religion or language.and, speaking of electoral politics, 2017 also marked the year the election commission decided that all future elections will conducting using electronic voting machines connected to voter-verifiable paper audit trail (vvpat) devices.what will the future hold for indian politics? we would be foolish to predict that. but, what we can predict with certainty is that it will be as exciting as the year gone by.",0.14620113012636382,"2017 indian politics : bjp continues dominance , midnight dramas abound , '
