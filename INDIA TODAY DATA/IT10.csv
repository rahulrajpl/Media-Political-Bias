2012-05-26,"govt comes to pm's rescue, says coal allocation done 'fairly'"," rejecting allegations against prime minister manmohan singh in allocation of coal blocks, the government on sunday said the allotment was done in an ""equitable and fair"" manner.""the process of allocation of blocks was equitable, fair and just which is borne out of the fact that there has never been any serious allegation against the working of the screening committee. the move to introduce competitive bidding is to make the selection process demonstrably more transparent,"" the coal ministry said in a statement.the clarification comes a day after activists of team anna picked up portions of a draft comptroller and auditor general report to make charges against singh when coal ministry was with him.as per a preliminary assessment by the cag, a loss of usd 192.7 billion was caused to the nation due to a coal scam and the issue led to uproar during the budget session of parliament.the coal ministry said the screening committee was a broad based body with representation from state governments at the level of the chief secretaries, concerned ministries of the central government and the coal companies. the move to introduce competitive bidding is to make the selection process demonstrably more transparent, it said.meanwhile, coal minister sriprakash jaiswal told reporters in north indian kanpur city that had coal blocks not been allocated, india would have lost precious foreign exchange in importing the commodity despite having it in abundance.asked specifically if he was clarifying team anna's allegation, jaiswal said he was not aware of any charges, ""nor do we have to respond to allegations levelled by anyone"".the coal ministry said, ""the allocation of coal blocks was never looked upon as a potential source for generating revenue for the central government...hence the question of maximising revenue does not arise at all.""allocation of coal blocks to private companies for captive use commenced in 1993 after the coal mines (nationalisation) act, 1973 was amended. this was done to attract private investments in specified end uses, it said.initially there was not much demand for such allocation, but as the economy grew, the demand for coal also grew, particularly in the energy sector, the ministry said.""it was felt that coal india ltd alone would not be able to meet the growing demand and, therefore, the option of giving a bigger role to the private sector was explored. it is in this background that we should appreciate the reasons for allocation of coal blocks to private parties for captive use during this period,"" it said.the idea of making allocations through competitive bidding was mooted in 2004 and in the following year the government initiated a proposal to amend the 1973 act.the delay of three years between initiating the process of legislative changes and introducing the amendment bill in parliament was mainly due to absence of consensus among various stakeholders and the amendment bill was finally introduced in 2008, it said.in the meanwhile, keeping in view the increase in applicants for coal blocks, the government evolved a consolidated set of guidelines to ensure consistency in allocation, the ministry noted.""in september 2005 the system was further improved bringing in greater transparency. in the improved system applications were invited through open advertisements against an identified list of coal blocks,"" it said.the intent of the government, the statement said, was to involve the private sector to invest in identified infrastructure sectors in the interest of the country and its economy and, to this end, this developmental process was resorted to.""the allocation of coal blocks to private sector companies is only for captive use and not for sale or commercial use of coal.""since the blocks are allocated to private companies only for captive purposes for the specified end-use, the question of linking the blocks to the market price/cil price of coal does not arise at all,"" it added.the budget session of parliament, which ended on may 22, saw a strong demand by the opposition for laying of the cag report. the left demand a jpc probe into the alleged scam.team anna members yesterday clubbed the prime minister and finance minister pranab mukherjee with 13 other cabinet ministers, whom they accused of corruption. the anti-graft group had never made allegations against the prime minister earlier.",0.09221014492753624,"govt comes pm ' rescue , says coal allocation done ' fairly '","rejecting allegations prime minister manmohan singh allocation coal blocks , government sunday said allotment done "" equitable fair "" manner.

2012-09-01,the whistleblowers," s.p. mahantesh, a deputy director with the department of cooperative audit in karnataka, was dragged out of his maruti 800 and beaten mercilessly with an iron rod on may 16 this year. after being on life support for five days, mahantesh's heart stopped beating and he succumbed to his injuries. the 48-year-old karnataka administrative service officer's fault was that he exposed the irregularities relating to allotment of land to cooperative societies in the state.mahantesh is only the latest among the long list of individuals who were martyred for exposing what they thought was wrong. ips officer narendra kumar was killed for taking on the mining mafia in madhya pradesh in march this year; nadeem ahmed saiyed of ahmedabad, who was also a witness in the naroda patiya massacre case, was murdered in novermber 2011 allegedly for fighting against the construction lobby; shashidhar mishra of begusarai in bihar and niyamat ansari of latehar in jharkhand were killed within a space of weeks because they exposed the rampant corruption in the mahatma gandhi national rural employment guarantee act.what sets these individuals apart from the rest is not just their integrity, but their immense courage which drove them to do the right thing without caring about the consequences. the prospect of physical harm is only one part of the threat that whistleblowers face. such individuals and their families are often ostracised for being ""troublemakers"". many are deserted by their own family, friends and colleagues who are afraid of being persecuted by those in power.the fact that an individual is subjected to such harassment just for discharging one's duties and maintaining one's integrity reflects the perversity of the system, in which dishonesty and corruption has become the norm. honest individuals end up fighting against the system in order to uphold it. ""the disease of greed has become entrenched in the system and in society as a whole. everybody wants to make quick money. those who dare to swim against the tide have to face the consequences,"" said justice (retd) n santosh hegde, the former karnataka lokayukta, who blew the lid over the rampant illegal mining in the state.hegde also believes that it is a better idea for whistleblowers go through a government watchdog body or through civil society outfits, rather put themselves directly in the line of fire. ""there is no doubt that a whistleblowers' bill needs to be passed to protect them, whistleblowers should expose the irregularities through a larger front rather than as mere individuals. fighting alone can be extremely dangerous,"" hegde said.another problem that comes with individual whistleblowers coming to the forefront is that we tend to lose sight of the it took a whistleblowing mp to expose coalgate and continue a tradition of faceless people taking on the rich and powerful so that they don't get away with corruption broader systemic issues that are at stake. for instance the death of satyendra dubey and shanmughan manjunath did provoke a massive outrage across the country and rightly so, but this did not translate into a larger demand to root out the corruption and criminality that has become deeply entrenched in the system.however, it is extremely important to highlight the heroism of individual whistleblowers as the country needs people to look up to. in terms of their background, dubey or manjunath were like any one of us, but they will always be remembered as they valued their integrity above their own lives. no less significant is the contribution of individuals like justice hegde, comptroller and auditor general vinod rai or bjp mp hansraj ahir, who exposed massive scams just by doing their jobs with dilligence. even while extolling the courage of these whistleblowers, we must remember the main motivation behind their actions: the quest for clean and transparent governance.===coalgate hero praises indirahansraj ahir, mpthe coal scam might seem like a sudden explosion that has sent the united progressive alliance government scurrying for cover. in actuality, the scam has been brought into the open because of six years of mundane, painstaking, thankless work by one man - bharatiya janata party mp from chandrapur, hansraj ahir.chandrapur might not be wasseypur, but its vast coal reserves have been a boon as well as a bane for this district in eastern maharashtra. ahir's story begins in the early 1990s, when he was a municipal corporator in chandrapur. that was the time when the pv narasimha rao government at the centre began ""giving away"" blocks of coal to private companies as part of its efforts to dismantle the country's ""socialist"" economy. ""the state-owned coal india began shrinking due to government apathy and hundreds lost their jobs in chandrapur,"" recollects ahir.""there are 27 coal mines in chandrapur. coal blocks were being given away for free"". after he became part of the standing committee of parliament on coal and steel in 2004, ahir realised that this is the case all over india and that private companies in collusion with government officials have unleashed havoc in various coal-rich parts of the country.ahir wrote to the prime minister and finance minister in 2006 asking for the allocation of coal blocks via auction.

two fare structures in the same city -thus implying that fares in the new corridor will also be brought to the 2002 level.the ministry of statistics and programme implementation warned that if the railways fare structure was followed, the kmrcl may become sick.and the urban development ministry said that given the current financial condition of the railways, it might not be able to finish the

2013-02-03,rohinton nariman quits as solicitor general," senior counsel rohinton f. nariman has resigned from the post of solicitor general of india allegedly over his differences with the law minister.sources said the resignation by the second highest law officer of the country had been accepted by the government. though speculation is rife about the differences between law minister ashwani kumar and nariman, the resignation letter does not refer to any such reason for relinquishing the post.short stint nariman, who is the son of eminent lawyer fali s. nariman, is the second lawyer to have resigned from the post in the past one-and-half years. he was appointed on july 27, 2011, for a period of three years following the resignation of senior counsel gopal subramaniam from the post on july 14, 2011.subramaniam himself had quit in a huff, protesting against union telecommunication minister kapil sibal's decision to appoint nariman to represent him in the 2g scam case in the supreme court. nariman's three-year tenure was to end on july 26, 2014.incidentally, both 1956-born nariman and subramaniam were made senior counsels by the supreme court on the same day on december 15, 1993. nariman was 37 when he was designated as senior counsel.differencessome lawyers say nariman never could get along with kumar. kumar himself was an additional solicitor general earlier. in fact, contrary to the general perception, kumar was designated as a senior counsel at an age lower than that of nariman. kumar was designated as a senior counsel on july 15, 1986 at the age of 34.though this could be one of the reasons, lawyers, who have known nariman closely, say he might have found himself out of place in view of his temperament. as a government law officer, he had to be on the defensive but nariman always had been an aggressive lawyer, a lawyer said.even though he was selective in the cases that he took up, nariman, after taking over as the solicitor general, took up cudgels on behalf of the government in a number of cases. he appeared for the government in the case filed by former army chief v.k. singh, the vodafone case, the coal scam case, the controversial kudankulam nuclear power plant case and the case relating to criteria for vip security and use of beacon lights.with there being only one solicitor general, unlike several additional solicitor generals, the government will have to find a replacement for nariman soon.the game plan the post did not lie vacant for long after the resignation of subramanium was accepted.though subramanium's replacement in the 2g was the immediate cause for his resignation, it was widely believed that he had given in following his long-standing differences with attorney general g.e. vahanvati.nariman was brought in because an ngo had filed an affidavit alleging that sibal misused his office by letting off a defaulting telecom company with a minor penalty. incidentally, nariman, who replaced subramanium, did not have to defend sibal as the court on its own decided not to entertain the affidavit. but the government lost a law officer in the process.",0.02083333333333334,rohinton nariman quits solicitor general,"senior counsel rohinton f. nariman resigned post solicitor general india allegedly differences law minister.sources said

2013-05-08,coalgate crisis: supreme court observations dampen congress' karnataka euphoria," the karnataka triumph made it a cracker of a morning for the scam-tainted congress on wednesday but an angered supreme court had carpet-bombed the ruling coalition back to the coal age by afternoon.as news of the stupendous congress show in karnataka began streaming in on wednesday morning, the party headquarters at 24 akbar road went festive with a vengeance, crackers and sweets included. not only had the party stormed back to power in the southern state after all of seven years, but its 121 seats in a 224-strong assembly had given it the satisfaction of seeing arch-rival bjp jostle for a poor second place with the janata dal (secular). both parties ended with 40 seats each, raising the unforeseen question of who the main opposition party would be in the new assembly.the congress euphoria didn't last. by 3 pm, the expected joy from karnataka was being taken to pieces by an unexpectedly bellicose supreme court.damage controlthe apex court's stinging observations on the centre's attempts to meddle with the central bureau of investigation (cbi ) probe into the coal block allocation scam shamed the executive afresh and put a huge question mark on law minister ashwani kumar's fortunes. the buzz by evening was that congress president sonia gandhi was in favour of kumar's removal as part of a damage-limitation exercise that could also expand to include bribery case-tainted railway minister pawan kumar bansal's ouster, but prime minister manmohan singh was reluctant to let his proteges go. congress sources spoke of a compromise possibility that would see kumar packed off to an insignificant ministry, and bansal's fate hanging fire.on wednesday, the supreme court took off from where it had left on april 26, when the cbi filed a fresh status report on its probe into the coal scam. it was searing in its observations on the law minister, attorney general, the role played by the prime minister's office (pmo) and cbi. in observations that could have farreaching significance, the court backed the enactment of a law granting independence to the cbi.

2013-05-09,coalgate crisis: supreme court observations dampen congress' karnataka euphoria," the karnataka triumph made it a cracker of a morning for the scam-tainted congress on wednesday but an angered supreme court had carpet-bombed the ruling coalition back to the coal age by afternoon.as news of the stupendous congress show in karnataka began streaming in on wednesday morning, the party headquarters at 24 akbar road went festive with a vengeance, crackers and sweets included. not only had the party stormed back to power in the southern state after all of seven years, but its 121 seats in a 224-strong assembly had given it the satisfaction of seeing arch-rival bjp jostle for a poor second place with the janata dal (secular). both parties ended with 40 seats each, raising the unforeseen question of who the main opposition party would be in the new assembly.the congress euphoria didn't last. by 3 pm, the expected joy from karnataka was being taken to pieces by an unexpectedly bellicose supreme court.damage controlthe apex court's stinging observations on the centre's attempts to meddle with the central bureau of investigation (cbi ) probe into the coal block allocation scam shamed the executive afresh and put a huge question mark on law minister ashwani kumar's fortunes. the buzz by evening was that congress president sonia gandhi was in favour of kumar's removal as part of a damage-limitation exercise that could also expand to include bribery case-tainted railway minister pawan kumar bansal's ouster, but prime minister manmohan singh was reluctant to let his proteges go. congress sources spoke of a compromise possibility that would see kumar packed off to an insignificant ministry, and bansal's fate hanging fire.on wednesday, the supreme court took off from where it had left on april 26, when the cbi filed a fresh status report on its probe into the coal scam. it was searing in its observations on the law minister, attorney general, the role played by the prime minister's office (pmo) and cbi. in observations that could have farreaching significance, the court backed the enactment of a law granting independence to the cbi. ""the heart of the status report was changed on the suggestion of government officials,"" the bench headed by justice r.m. lodha said. ""the cbi has become the state's parrot. only screaming, repeating the master's voice,"" justice lodha said.""the changes are of significant nature. the entire direction of the probe is changed. investigation goes in a particular direction. inferences are different. these (the changes) are vital links and attributes,'' the court said. it expressed its indignation over the pmo's attempts to tweak the status report, and made its displeasure known. ""how on earth the two of them (joint secretaries from the pmo and coal ministry) were allowed to see the draft status report... the job of the cbi is interrogation or interaction? is it (investigation) a collaborative affair? what is the cbi doing?

sent to three days in the agency's custody by a delhi court for allegedly taking a bribe of rs seven lakh from a businessman to favour him in a land dispute case.superintendent dutt, cbi (central bureau of investigation) inspector rajesh chandra karnatak, alleged middleman rajesh pachisia and businessman dinesh chand gupta were produced before the court where cbi sought seven days police custody of the four accused.""all the accused are remanded in cbi custody till 21 may,"" special cbi judge v k gupta said.dutt, however, claimed innocence and alleged a conspiracy has been hatched to keep him out of the supreme court-monitored coalgate probe team.during the hearing, the cbi prosecutor told the court that dutt and karnatak were in the same branch in the agency and pachisia was in regular contact with them.cbi said dinesh gupta had a land dispute and a cheating case was registered against him at amar colony police station here and dutt used to pressurize the delhi police officials, who were investigating the cheating case, to quash the fir and for this he had demanded rs 15 lakh from gupta.the prosecutor said the sho of amar colony police station was initially reluctant but later he succumbed to the pressure and the fir was quashed.cbi said pachisia was apprehended friday when was handing over rs seven lakh to karnatak.the prosecutor told the court that rs 15 lakh cash was recovered from pachisia, karnatak and gupta.seeking seven days custody of the four accused, the prosecutor also said that during the searches conducted by the agency, rs 24 lakh cash was recovered from the residence of karnatak friday.opposing cbi's plea for police custody, the defence counsel said dutt was investigating a very important case of coalgate scam under the supervision of the supreme court and if such an allegation is levelled against such a senior official, then the court should look into it very cautiously.dutt's counsel said someone was trying to destroy career of the senior officer.""the doubt which we have in our mind is that when an officer is involved in a very important case, then someone may try to divert the attention.""someone might want to remove him from the probe,"" the counsel said.he told the court that his client is being targetted and nothing has been recovered from his possession by the agency.""he is investigating an important case

of conspiracy under the ipc and the prevention of corruption act, for which they are charged with, is seven years and in such a situation, reasons for arrest have to be recorded, which has not been done in this case.dutt's counsel said why a senior cbi officer would get involved in a dispute between two private parties.he said dutt is being targeted as there is no direct involvement of the cbi's

""the pm has a completely untarnished and unblemished image in polity and nobody has ever questioned his integrity. attacking the pm in this manner on the part of the opposition is nothing but dirty politics,"" remarked nath, one of the seniormost ministers of the upa government who holds the crucial parliamentary affairs and urban development portfolios.nath, a former acolyte of the late prime minister rajiv gandhi, is also a close confidant of congress president sonia gandhi. his statement is significant as so far the government has remained steadfast that the pm has nothing to do with the coalgate scam. it has stoutly defended the pm from the opposition in parliament. his statements could also be a tactical move to contain the pressure from the supreme court, which has been regularly monitoring the coalgate probe. the department of personnel and training has also stonewalled the agency's effort to quiz tka nair, the adviser to the pm who earlier served as a principal secretary to manmohan singh when he handled the coal portfolio from 2006-2009, as also present cec v.s. sampath and election commissioner h.s. brahma (both former power secretaries).a cbi officer had recently recommended in file notings that the pm needs to be examined in connection with the coal scam but the cbi chief was of the view that the need to examine him had not arisen. the agency may be forced to take a fresh look following this statement.manmohan said on saturday that while he made a long statement on the coal matter in parliament recently, he was not allowed to read that statement but he did issue it and it is a public document. ""i am an open book,"" he said, adding, ""i have not prevented anybody from looking at my conduct."" his statements came on board air india one on his flight home after attending the g20 summit in st. petersburg, russia.the prime minister was asked whether he believed that he himself had sufficiently answered questions posed by the bjp about his government, about him in person and his charge that the opposition was obstructing parliament and hurting the economy. ""i try to answer all questions that have been raised. i have no desire to hide anything from parliament, whether it is the coal matter or other matters. i have been as forthright as i can,"" he said.under attackthe opposition attacked the pm on saturday with bjp campaign committee chief narendra modi scathing in his attack on the government at a rally at ambikapuri, chhattisgarh, even as leader of the opposition in the lok sabha sushma swaraj said in new delhi: ""the coal scam has become like a tv serial in which new episodes are seen at regular intervals.""as important documents needed by the cbi have not been provided by the coal ministry, the probe is being stalled and the agency is unable to complete its probe and file chargesheets. as reported by mail today earlier, of the 13 accused companies, files related to six are untraceable.",0.01005802707930368,kamal nath says cbi even question pm connection coalgate,"kamal naththe "" caged parrot "" ( read cbi ) may find free enough fly closer 7 , race course road government saying ready allow cbi question prime minister connection coalgate scam agency feels required.speaking mail today , parliamentary affairs minister kamal nath said : "" prime minister nothing hide ; law says cbi question anyone. consider necessary part probe , cbi even question pm. , nobody law. established fact , cbi authority question anyone.

2013-11-06,"full text of modi's speech in jagdalpur on nov 7, 2013","starts with bharat mata ki... the crowd shouts: jai.i pay respect to goddess of basta aradhya devi, mata dhanteswar. brothers, sisters, mothers of bastar, youths, those mps present on the stage sri dinesh kashyap, bhai kedar kashyap, bhai subhash kashyap, bhai santosh bapta, beduram kashyap, mahesh gagda, sri bhandavi, sri ganiram barsi, sister lata husandi, sri kedar kashyap and those brothers and sisters of bastar present in large numbers. i have come to jagdalpur several times before, and have visited the interiors of bastar as i used to look at the bjp's organisational work. it was then that i had an opportunity to know about chhattisgarh to a large extent. this bastar is larger than kerala state. bastar has enormous potential, rich natural resources but it has been unfortunate that till the time chhattisgarh was part of madhya pradesh, congress was ruling but it did not care about the region. this was a picnic spot for the congress. they used to come here with their friends to visit the forest and used to show them the tribals inhabiting the region, used to show our poverty and used to take all accolades.brothers and sisters, the people of chhattisgarh should not forget the contributions of atal behari vajpayee. it was the foresightedness of vajpayee ji, it was his thought that if chhattisgarh is created as a different state, then it will give an opportunity to develop the state. the soil of this region has immense power and potential.chhattisgarh should be made prosperous... this was the dream of atal behari vajpayee ji. today with the blessings of maa dhanteshwari i take pride in the initiatives taken by vajpayee ji. i pay my respect to vajpayee ji who laid the foundation of chhattisgarh. vajpayee ji had compassion for poor, downtrodden and the exploited tribes and the victims of oppression. he never used to give slogans but had long term policy in his mind. he ensured that government work the welfare the people.dear tribal brothers, please tell me since when the tribal society existing in this country. isn't it for 1000s of years? wasn't it existing prior to independence? aren't the tribal poor people? after independence, many congress governments were formed but nobody remembered tribals, their poverty was not looked at, there was no education and career for the children of tribals. after so many years of independence, vajpayee was the first pm who created a special ministry for the welfare of tribals. he created separate minister, ministry, department, officials, and budget and ensured that the ministry could work independently. brothers and sisters, many years after independence vajpayee ji took initative for the welfare of tribals. it was only after this that the lifestyle of tribals saw remarkable improvement. it is not only this but in the northeast as well. nagaland, arunachal pradesh, manipur where tribals are in large in numbers, separate departments were created. he took special care of the tribals in the far-flung areas of nagaland, mizoram, manipur.as he created the new state of chhattisgarh, he created a new system for the tribals. i worked in this region when chhattisgarh was created, then i was not the gujarat chief minister. when chhattisgarh was created it was ruled by the congress. when i recall the work done during the three years of congress rule, i am reminded of the atrocities, i get goosebumps. chhattisgarh was under the rule of repression and oppression. when the party workers of bjp protested for their demands, tribals were beaten up and had to be hopitalised for as long as 6 months. such cruel rulers were not seen in india. but chhattisgarh saw the despotic rule, three years before its birth. we feared for the dream of chhattisgarh as seen by atal behari vajpayee - we feared for its people.but i will salute the resolute nature of my brothers in chhattisgarh - dalits, adivasis - they saw it and in the very first elections in chhattisgarh, they threw off the yoke of misrule and exploitation - in a manner that started the countdown to the fall of congress in india. for this, i shall congratulate you. just imagine if you have not given 10 years to dr raman singh and bjp what would have been the state of our chhattisgarh today. if the looters got hold of chhattisgarh then nothing would have remained - nothing.the central government has got embroiled in the coal scam - who knows if they would have spared even a kilo of chhattisgarh coal - would have looted that too. it is your farsightedness that prevented congress rule in chhattisgarh or else chhattisgarh would have been doomed under the paws of the congress in 10 years. i feel the need to compare the state of three states. atal bihari vajpayee took people into confidence and, without any politicking or bloodshed, carved out three new states - jharkhand, uttarakhand and chhattisgarh. look at the last 10 years of progress report of these three states - take stock. jharkhand is where it was 10 years ago, uttarakhand has gone backwards, chhattisgarh is the only in these three that has progressed. what is the reason? reason is your farsightedness, the understanding shown by my adivasi brothers of chhattisgarh.congress got many a chance in uttarakhand - that resulted in lack of development in the state. we all witnessed the tragedy of kedarnath ji - thousands from across the country died. but the government of uttarakhand cares two hoots about it. look at jharkhand. the richest state in terms of mineral wealth, but it is plagued with political instability. the machinations of the congress-led central government to wrest power in jharkhand is well known. engineering defections, splitting parties, continued and look at the result. jharkhand kept slipping. chhattisgarh was saved because of your trust in dr raman singh and bjp. the state has seen rapid development under a stable government. three examples are before you and today i have travelled from gujarat to beseech you. in the past the people of india voted for parties, castes and creed, relations. but times have changed. you must vote for development. you must have thought about your own good while voting. but today time has come for you to vote for a better tomorrow for your children. and such a future can only be ensured by bjp and dr raman singh.i would request you to ensure the continued development of chhattisgarh. the rapid pace at which chhattisgarh is progressing must be maintained and enhanced. in our families children grow up faster in their teens, say after 13 a boy or a girl grows up quickly. every six months they outgrow their clothes. from 13 to 18 children grow rapidly. they gain in height, weight. chhattisgarh is facing such an age, the teens. if it is nurtured along the path of development and growth the heights it can reach is only imaginable. so brothers and sisters, these coming five years are the most crucial in the development of chhattisgarh.dr raman singh has provided a solid foundation of development. now it is time to build on the foundation, time to take chhattisgarh to newer heights. for that the years from 2013 to 2018 are the most crucial. if during this duration chhattisgarh establishes itself, chhattisgarh's development gathers momentum then this journey would not stop for a century to come. that is why i tell you that this election is not about choosing a government for the next five years. it is an election that will establish the foundation for development for the coming 100 years. vote should be for development and politics of vote banks should be buried once and for all.has anyone seen such a huge gathering in jagdalpur, has anyone imagined? the winds of change are blowing. the country wants development, wants a government that works for the betterment of the downtrodden. the congress slogan was ""congress ka hath garib ke sath"". what happened? they showed you their hand and once they got elected they tried their hand and when they attained mastery in that then it is sleight of hand and nothing else. their palm haven't spared coal either. people are asking for lockers in banks, not for keeping gold or jewellery or money, to keep coal, safe. someone told me see modi ji not only coal we shall have to soon ask for lockers to store onions too. when guests come we shall give them a whiff of the onion and keep it back in the locker.brothers and sisters, such a government that makes you shed tears without onions, a government that has snatched onion off the menu from the poor who used to supplant his diet of bajra, jowar or wheat roti with onions must be thrown off from power in this country. they promised. let me ask you a question. you shall answer. do you have faith in congress and its promise? they promised that when they come to power in delhi they will control inflation in 100 days. should you spare those that have broken their promises? should you hand over chhattisgarh to them? should you believe in their false promises?i firmly believe that my brothers and sisters from chhattisgarh would not fall prey to the false promises of the congress. tell me, my friend, if atal bihari vajpayee had not dreamt about chhattisgarh, if you had not mandated for dr raman singh and had he not provided you with a stable government - could anybody amongst you have dreamt of a university in bastar? today bastar has a university. our country faces a shortage of doctors. the poor don't get treatment. why? because the congress is least interested in establishing medical colleges. as long as they do not get their bags of cash they are not interested in medical colleges. when a medical college is established until and unless piles of capitation money changes hands you won't get admission there.from where will you get doctors? if there are no doctors from where will the poor get medical care? i would like to praise dr raman singh that he has established a medical college in this backward district and taken the initiative for future medical care here. dr raman singh has a vision. he is easily accessible to the people here. he interacts with them regularly, but people do not usually recognise him by his name. who is dr raman singh? but when you say 'haawal wala baba' (the rice man) the recognition is instant. ensuring food security for the poor and downtrodden has been the primary focus of bjp.and listen to what the shahzada from delhi says. he misleads people by saying 'we brought food security bill, we ensured food security'. my dear brothers and sisters, you and only you at chhattisgarh know that it was the bjp government of chhattisgarh which brought the first ever law related to food security anywhere in india. even the government at delhi understood and appreciated the act. dr raman singh has given the people the right to skill development, right to training.a government for development should be also be a sensitive one. the violence of maoism, the bombs the bullets, the human casualty, security forces killed, amidst all this bloodbath, a resolute government has gone ahead with the agenda of development. dr raman singh has demonstrated it. i would like to present before you cases of two governments in india. i shall also ask the political pundits to pay attention. one sensitive and the other insensitive. in may, dr raman singh was travelling around chhattisgarh on a yatra. around the same time, congress party leaders were on their yatras. maoists killed a substantial numbers of congress leaders. recently there was a mammoth rally in patna. terrorists struck. serial blasts targeted the dais, leaders of bjp. what did raman singh do and what did the bihar cm do? dr raman singh briefed the media, said that we shall probe the incident and if there has been any lapse at any level it would be addressed. he ordered an inquiry and adjourned his own yatra. he visited the family of the slain congress leaders, and a couple of days later in the nia meeting at delhi his actions were lauded.on the other hand, after such a grave incident in patna we found the bihar government in rajgir. they seemed least bothered. their body language and verbal statements betrayed some sort of pleasure. when media asked them, pat came the reply, not only are they not acknowledging any lapse, they ruled out any probe. categorically.see the difference between a sensitive chief minister and a proud and vain one whose only goal is to be in power. the reaction, the difference is there for the country to see. i would like to laud dr raman singh for his patience, his courage in trying situations and i believe that in the next five years chhattisgarh would outstrip gujarat in development . and that would be a proud day for me. the way he took up local issues, wiped out the deficit in electricity generation, worked for the uplift of the downtrodden, the adivasis, the poor. i shall urge you to ensure a landslide victory for bjp . vote for the lotus symbol and ensure the development of chhattisgarh for the next century. i am thankful to you for the chance you have given us. i would like to congratulate you.'apan sobai bastar ki bhai bahin manke mocho patle guhar kare che bhartiya janata part cho kamal phool ne vote dyun bhari bahumat se jitwana - samay ke macho - jay johar' (most probably chhattisgarhi)",0.06277682372723692,"full text modi ' speech jagdalpur nov 7 , 2013","starts bharat mata ki ... crowd shouts : jai.i pay respect goddess basta aradhya devi , mata dhanteswar. brothers , sisters , mothers bastar , youths , mps present stage sri dinesh kashyap , bhai kedar kashyap , bhai subhash kashyap , bhai santosh bapta , beduram kashyap , mahesh gagda , sri bhandavi , sri ganiram barsi , sister lata husandi , sri kedar kashyap brothers sisters bastar present large numbers. come jagdalpur several times , visited interiors bastar used look bjp ' organisational work. opportunity know chhattisgarh large extent. bastar larger kerala state. bastar enormous potential , rich natural resources unfortunate till time chhattisgarh part madhya pradesh , congress ruling care region. picnic spot congress. used come friends visit forest used show tribals inhabiting region , used show poverty used take accolades.brothers sisters , people chhattisgarh forget contributions atal behari vajpayee. foresightedness vajpayee ji , thought chhattisgarh created different state , give opportunity develop state. soil region immense power potential.chhattisgarh made prosperous ... dream atal behari vajpayee ji. today blessings maa dhanteshwari take pride initiatives taken vajpayee ji. pay respect vajpayee ji laid foundation chhattisgarh. vajpayee ji compassion poor , downtrodden exploited tribes victims oppression. never used give slogans long term policy mind. ensured government work welfare people.dear tribal brothers , please tell since tribal society existing country.

the winds of change are blowing. the country wants development, wants a government that works for the betterment of the downtrodden. the congress slogan was ""congress ka hath garib ke sath"". what happened? they showed you their hand and once they got elected they tried their hand and when they attained mastery in that then it is sleight of hand and nothing else. their palm haven't spared coal either. people are asking for lockers in banks, not for keeping gold or jewellery or money, to keep coal, safe. someone told me see modi ji not only coal we shall have to soon ask for lockers to store onions too. when guests come we shall give them a whiff of the onion and keep it back in the locker.brothers and sisters, such a government that makes you shed tears without onions, a government that has snatched onion off the menu from the poor who used to supplant his diet of bajra, jowar or wheat roti with onions must be thrown off from power in this country. they promised. let me ask you a question. you shall answer. do you have faith in congress and its promise? they promised that when they come to power in delhi they will control inflation in 100 days. should you spare those that have broken their promises? should you hand over chhattisgarh to them? should you believe in their false promises?i firmly believe that my brothers and sisters from chhattisgarh would not fall prey to the false promises of the congress. tell me, my friend, if atal bihari vajpayee had not dreamt about chhattisgarh, if you had not mandated for dr raman singh and had he not provided you with a stable government - could anybody amongst you have dreamt of a university in bastar? today bastar has a university. our country faces a shortage of doctors. the poor don't get treatment. why? because the congress is least interested in establishing medical colleges. as long as they do not get their bags of cash they are not interested in medical colleges. when a medical college is established until and unless piles of capitation money changes hands you won't get admission there.from where will you get doctors? if there are no doctors from where will the poor get medical care? i would like to praise dr raman singh that he has established a medical college in this backward district and taken the initiative for future medical care here. dr raman singh has a vision. he is easily accessible to the people here. he interacts with them regularly, but people do not usually recognise him by his name. who is dr raman singh? but when you say 'haawal wala baba' (the rice man) the recognition is instant. ensuring food security for the poor and downtrodden has been the primary focus of bjp.and listen to what the shahzada from delhi says. he misleads people by saying 'we brought food security bill, we ensured food security'. my dear brothers and sisters, you and only you at chhattisgarh know that it was the bjp government of chhattisgarh which brought the first ever law related to food security anywhere in india. even the government at delhi understood and appreciated the act. dr raman singh has given the people the right to skill development, right to training.a government for development should be also be a sensitive one. the violence of maoism, the bombs the bullets, the human casualty, security forces killed, amidst all this bloodbath, a resolute government has gone ahead with the agenda of development. dr raman singh has demonstrated it. i would like to present before you cases of two governments in india. i shall also ask the political pundits to pay attention. one sensitive and the other insensitive. in may, dr raman singh was travelling around chhattisgarh on a yatra. around the same time, congress party leaders were on their yatras. maoists killed a substantial numbers of congress leaders. recently there was a mammoth rally in patna. terrorists struck. serial blasts targeted the dais, leaders of bjp. what did raman singh do and what did the bihar cm do? dr raman singh briefed the media, said that we shall probe the incident and if there has been any lapse at any level it would be addressed. he ordered an inquiry and adjourned his own yatra. he visited the family of the slain congress leaders, and a couple of days later in the nia meeting at delhi his actions were lauded.on the other hand, after such a grave incident in patna we found the bihar government in rajgir. they seemed least bothered. their body language and verbal statements betrayed some sort of pleasure. when media asked them, pat came the reply, not only are they not acknowledging any lapse, they ruled out any probe. categorically.see the difference between a sensitive chief minister and a proud and vain one whose only goal is to be in power. the reaction, the difference is there for the country to see. i would like to laud dr raman singh for his patience, his courage in trying situations and i believe that in the next five years chhattisgarh would outstrip gujarat in development . and that would be a proud day for me. the way he took up local issues, wiped out the deficit in electricity generation, worked for the uplift of the downtrodden, the adivasis, the poor. i shall urge you to ensure a landslide victory for bjp . vote for the lotus symbol and ensure the development of chhattisgarh for the next century. i am thankful to you for the chance you have given us. i would like to congratulate you.'apan sobai bastar ki bhai bahin manke mocho patle guhar kare che bhartiya janata part cho kamal phool ne vote dyun bhari bahumat se jitwana - samay ke macho - jay johar' (most probably chhattisgarhi)",0.06277682372723692,"full text modi ' speech jagdalpur nov 7 , 2013","starts bharat mata ki ... crowd shouts : jai.i pay respect goddess basta aradhya devi , mata dhanteswar. brothers , sisters , mothers bastar , youths , mps present stage sri dinesh kashyap , bhai kedar kashyap , bhai subhash kashyap , bhai santosh bapta , beduram kashyap , mahesh gagda , sri bhandavi , sri ganiram barsi , sister lata husandi , sri kedar kashyap brothers sisters bastar present large numbers. come jagdalpur several times , visited interiors bastar used look bjp ' organisational work. opportunity know chhattisgarh large extent. bastar larger kerala state. bastar enormous potential , rich natural resources unfortunate till time chhattisgarh part madhya pradesh , congress ruling care region. picnic spot congress. used come friends visit forest used show tribals inhabiting region , used show poverty used take accolades.brothers sisters , people chhattisgarh forget contributions atal behari vajpayee. foresightedness vajpayee ji , thought chhattisgarh created different state , give opportunity develop state. soil region immense power potential.chhattisgarh made prosperous ... dream atal behari vajpayee ji. today blessings maa dhanteshwari take pride initiatives taken vajpayee ji. pay respect vajpayee ji laid foundation chhattisgarh. vajpayee ji compassion poor , downtrodden exploited tribes victims oppression. never used give slogans long term policy mind. ensured government work welfare people.dear tribal brothers , please tell since tribal society existing country.

2014-02-05,"namo in kolkata live: third front is trying to make india third rate, says modi","narendra modi debuted in mamata banerjee's bastion of west bengal with his much touted jan chetna sabha. senior bjp leaders shahnawaz hussain, shakeel ansari, varun gandhi and tapan sikdar are also present on the stage. interestingly, famour magician pc sircar also decided to come and support modi and was seen on the stage.however, as opposed to the buzz and hype surrounding the attendance for the rally, just about 50,000 people had turned up contrary to the 3 lakh figure bjp workers were talking about. here are the highlights of modi's first speech in kolkata:3.30-4.15 pm: narendra modi addresses the crowd in bengali and lists all the bengali things he loves - drga puja, rasgullas, literature, including of course bengal itself.--i have never seen such a sea of humanity.--the land of bengal was highly critical in making india the modern, progressive nation it is today.--my gujarat has long relationship with west bengal. most people don't know that rabindranath tagore's brother lived in ahmedabad for years and is responsible for making ahmedabad what it is today.--sri aurobindo and swami vivekanada, both sons of bengal, spent huge amounts of time in gujarat. this is why i say, gujarat has alaways had a long standing connection with west bengal.-if we have to see india rise, we have to make bengal rise first. india can regain its position of viswaguru (world leader) if only bengal regains its past glory as the rashtraguru (leader of the state).--all political panditsnwill be proved wrong. they study on the basis of historical records. but they cannot understand the mood of the people. it has been 60 years, it is too much, we cannot wait anymore. there have been too many promises, we have been waiting for these promises for 60 years. now the nation will not wait anymore.--the nation wants only development, the poor want food, the elderly want health care, the youth want employment, the women want safety, the villages want electricity, the children want education. after 60 years do we not have the right to ask any of these?--but these political parties do not care about the desires of the common man.--which is why you called for change, parivartan. but have you had parivartan? bengal is not going to the polls anytime soon. you voted for parivartan. but you can do one thing. see, i always feel that bengal has always pointed the direction in which the country goes. in this election can bengal show the direction in which the country goes. you will not have state elections, but in the lok sabha elections please let bjp win all bengal seats.--your government has promised you certain things, ask them for accountability, but give me all the lok sabha seats and then ask me for what i have done.--lets make a deal. let the mamata bengal government work for the betterment of bengal and let the bjp work for the betterment of the nation, and this is the only way you will have laddoos in both your hands. if you vote someone else to power how will you then know what we are capable of?--west bengal cannot progress by itself. it needs support from the centre also. let me assure you, the change at the centre will only benefit west bengal. if you give me all the lok sabha seats i will have more reason to come here again and again, to do your work, to undo all the unfairness bengal has suffered over the past 60 years.-i have come to you with the conviction that i will bring you change.-in 1980 bengal used to grow at 10 per cent. now, it crawls at barely 3 to 4 per cent. can someone tell me what have those people who sang songs for the labourers and farmers, what did they do for those farmers and labourers? today a management, it graduate, engineer is well respected but those working in industrial manufacturing are considered nothing. i want to give them respect.-i am surprised. do you have electricity? do you have 24 hour electricity? no. why? coal mines, water resources are all next to you why then do you not have all these resources. tell me, if gujarat can get 24 hour electricity why not bengal. and the reason is that you have factories and power plants, but because of the centre and their coal scams and missing files, bengal's power plants are lying idle.--for a state that calls even its daughter ma, only 60 peer cent of schools have toilets for women. how is that possible? where is the change?--there is electricity in just 30 per cent of schools. how will you run computers and apply for higher education if you don't have computers.--east india is struggling for development. how van a man be strong with just one arm working. can the east of the country not be as strong as the west. india's west is still progressing but not the east. the main reason is that there is no third front in the west. these people are trying to divide the country further in the name of the third front and these are the very people who ruled the east of the country.--if we have to take india forward we need to remove all these third front pretensions.--third front wants to make india third rate.-every time there are elections, all these parties start talking about the poor and secularism. all these so called secular parties have reduced our minorities, the muslims to just a vote bank.-in gujarat, there are 4,500 haj reservations and the applicants we get are 37,00. bengal has 11,600 reservations against 12,000 applications.-today, in bengal, all jobs are going to bangladeshis.-my definition of secularism is simple. government's only religion is nation first , govt's religious book is the constitution, government has only one devotion that is the nation, government has only one power, - the mandate of 1000 crore people.-if you vote for us there will be 3 benefits that will accrue for you: mamata will work for you here, i will work for you at the centre and pranab da is already there too. vikas bhi, imaan bhi, gareebon ka samman bhi ( progress, integrity and upliftment of the poor, bjp's new slogan).-but now let me talk about congress' manipulations. when indira gandhi was killed, rajiv was in kolkata and left for delhi. according to democratic principles the next senior most minister should have been the pm. pranab mukherjee should have been the next pm. the congress felt so threatened that when rajiv made the govt, he kept pranab even out of the cabinet. not even that in 2004, if sonia did not want to be pm, it should have gone to pranab da, but manmohan singh was made the pm.-people of bengal, do not forget these slights which have been exacted upon bengalis and people.-narendra modi signed off with rabindranath tagore's famous words.. where the mind is without fear and the head is held high, into that heaven of freedom my father, let my country awake.2.55-3.25 pm: rajnath singh takes to the stage, waxes eloquent on bengal's rich history and heritage and calls swami vivekananda - born in bengal - the first global indian. singh remembers dr shyama prasad mookerji, one of the founding members of the jan sangh, in an attempt to trace the 'long standing' relationship that bengal has with bjp.singh first targeted the left government, saying the statehas no industries left today, even the famous jute industry is all but dead.the cpi-m ruined the economy of west bengal.and then went on tackle mamata banerjee and her track record on crime againstwomen but remained more or less silent on her tmc government, sparking instant speculation about a possible alliance between the two.west bengal should go see gujarat, the development ofgujarat, narendra modi's gujarat. the congresskeeps raking up the issue of the 2002 riots. we agree there was a huge tragedyin modi's state. but just once, just once in those 12 years did this happen.never again under modi's rule has that happened. minorities now feel safe,because after that not once has there been a communal incident in the state.he said minorities in gujarat had the highest per capita income in the entire country. in the english alphabet, m is followed by n. manmohan singh is the current pm, next is the chance of narendra modi. 2.50 pm: west bengal bjp cheif rahul sinha takes to the stage after felicitation of narendra modi and rajnath singh. 2.48 pm: narendra modi arrived at kolkata's dumdum airport via a special flight and then took a chooper to the rally venue at brigade ground. he has just arrived at the venue.2.35 pm: shahnawaz hussain - we will soon be number 1 in bengal. we have seen both dada and didi but now it is time for modi and all of you need to vote for change. we will not divide our country into hindu and muslims. we are at one seat now but will soon be voted to power by people of bengal. we are fighting for saving the nation. people have started believing that he will harm muslims but this is only a fear of people.tmc is close to congress and they are like same water in a different glass. all parties which are at third number in theie states are making the third front at the centre.2.20 pm: 50 cops from gujarat police have been brought in forsecurity reasons. the rally venue is heavily fortified with six watchtowers along with cctvs installed specifically for modi's rally. 2.10 pm: bjp leaders target mamata, say mamata dividing bengali society by favouring the muslims; by giving cycles to minorities, separate hospitals and special emoluments for the imams. 1.45 pm: musician bappi lahiri has also joined the list of celebrities endoring narendra modi. he too was seen on stage at the jan chetna sabha. 1.40 pm: famour magician pc sircar joins the bandwagon of modi supporters, seen on stage with varios bjp leaders.what modi can achieve in mamata's bengal:riding high on the momentum built in favour of its prime ministerial candidate narendra modi nationwide, the bharatiya janata party begins its tryst with west bengal on wednesday. with its mascot modi scheduled to address a massive rally at the historic brigade parade grounds in kolkata on february 5, the party hopes to add a saffron hue to mamata banerjee's blue bengal.the bjp has been using novel ways to drum up support for the mega rally. these include hosting regular road shows, party workers and supporters organising runs and walks sporting modi masks and online sale of seats at the rally.social media platform is the saffron party's stronghold and it has used it to the fullest to garner support here for modi. in keeping with modi's humble 'tea vendor' appeal which he has highlighted all across his rallies in different parts of the country, nearly 100 'namo tea stalls' have been put up across the state.narendra modi at the jan chetna sabha in kolkata.but tea is nothing compared to sweets when it comes to moving babu moshais. perhaps that's why bjp workers have been distributing specially made 'namo sweets' in the state. around five lakh people are expected to attend the rally, claim party leaders.what modi will say:the gujarat chief minister has constantly attacked congress leadership, especially the party's first family, in his speeches. that is not going to work in the left bastion which was considered impregnable until mamata banerjee-led trinamool congress turned the tables on them in 2011.here, he will have to target banerjee and left which together make up the political landscape of the province.the party's state unit told ians that modi might raise the pitch for declassification of secret files on netaji subhas chandra bose, something which a host of activists and a section of the nationalist leader's family has been demanding for long.in his previous speeches, modi has made frequent references to subhas chandra bose and swami vivekanand. how bjp may perform in bengal:the bjp's past record in the 42 lok sabha seats in bengal has been bleak. the party bagged a solitary seat here in 1998 and doubled its tally in the next elections in 1999. however, in the last elections in 2009, the party managed only the darjeeling constituency when senior bjp leader jaswant singh -- backed by the gorkha janmukti morcha which holds sway in the region -- came up trumps.the bjp and the rashtriya swayamsevak sangh (rss) have traditionally never been able to make much of an impact in west bengal, though the party's former avatar jan sangh was co-founded by the son of the soil, shyama prasad mukherjee.but the 2014 brings new hope for the modi-led party. the party has witnessed more than two-fold increase in the membership of the bjp's state unit.a local leader of the party claimed that the total membership has increased from three lakh in 2011 to more than seven lakh in 2013. two lakh new members have enrolled in the last six months, which party leaders have attributed to modi's anointment as the prime ministerial candidate. read more herehowever, the 27 per cent muslim community in the state, more than the national average, which plays a major role in the power sweepstake might not serve the best interest of the party.on the positive side, the saffron brigade hopes to cash in on a strong anti-congress sentiment in the country, an equally strong anti-incumbency wave against mamata banerjee-led tmc government in the state and a so-called 'modi wave'. let us wait to watch if the combination of these factors can help the party break into this left-tmc stronghold and push the bjp's ls tally here into double digit.

graft and price rise, saying the ""abcd of corruption"" has become the identity of the grand old party.""i am surprised that congress leaders are accusing others of corruption. how can they point fingers at others when their own government has seen so many scams?"" modi asked, addressing a the fateh rally in this punjab town, 145 km from chandigarh.""they (congress) have changed the nomenclature of abcd. it is now a for adarsh (scam), b for bofors, c for coal scam,"" he said, listing the various scandals.modi asserted that he would not allow anyone to loot the treasury.slamming the ""delay"" by upa in granting 'one-rank, one-pension' for ex-servicemen, narendra modi on sunday accused congress of playing ""fraud"" with the armed forces and mocked rahul gandhi's pitch on fighting corruption.with leaders from the ally shiromani akali dal on the dais, the gujarat chief minister, who donned a saffron turban, also dismissed as ""rumours and a pack of lies"" the controversy about migration of sikh farmers from kutch region in his state, promising that no sikh farmer will have to leave gujarat. read: highlightshe described the bjp-sad alliance in punjab as a symbol of hindu-sikh unity which has put to end the ""congress' game of divide and rule"".in his 30-minutes speech at a packed ground, modi was unsparing in his attack on congress and said the party was now throwing pepper instead of dust in the eyes of the people to befool them, a reference to the pepper spray incident in lok sabha involving an expelled congress mp during the taking up of telangana bill.the bjp's prime ministerial candidate took potshots at the gandhi family and congress for targeting other parties on corruption.""i am surprised that the leader of congress is now engaged in raising fingers on other political parties on the issue of corruption, when the entire abcd has become the identity of the corruption of congress. when rajiv gandhi was ruling the country as prime minister, there was no other party but only congress, which was in power from parliament to panchayat.""at that time he had said that when he sends a rupee from delhi, only 15 paisas reach the village. what was this 'panja' which used to rub the rupee (one rupee coin) and it would turn into 15 paisa,"" modi said, vowing that if he is elected prime minister he will occupy the top seat as a ""chowkidar"" (warchman) and won't allow the 'panja' (hand) to cast its shadow on the state treasury.he hit out congress on one-rank, one-pension issue.after rahul gandhi's push, the government accepted the long-standing demand of ex-servicemen for 'one-rank, one-pension' and allocated rs 500 crore for the fund a few days back. this decision is expected to benefit around 30 lakh retired personnel of the armed forces.modi wondered why the government did not bring this proposal in previous budgets even as it was in power for last ten years.""the government, which is sitting in delhi has always been playing a farce with the armed forces. before this also, a number of times, the finance minister of congress had made announcements about one rank one pension (orop) but never fulfilled it.""even this time since i am repeatedly talking about it, they have announced it but this is a ""fraud"" (dhokha) with you. had congress party been honest, they had the chance to it in 10 budgets from 2004 to 2014. but they did not do it,"" modi said.maintaining that had the nda government led by atal bihari vajpayee come to power in 2004, this would have been done, the bjp's prime ministerial candidate, ""only our government will be able to implement it.""modi also appeared to be reaching out to upa ally national conference as he mentioned union minister farooq abdullah among the leaders from whom he learnt how the administration is run.""i worked with bansi lal, parkash singh badal, om prakash chautala, farooq abdullah and i saw how administration is run. what could i learn from badal sahab, helped me a lot in running the government in gujarat. being with these seniors helped me a lot in administration,"" he said.national conference was earlier with nda while bjp is likely to have an alliance with chautala's inld this time as well.accusing congress of cheating people, modi said, ""now since they felt that you have become aware, they have engaged in throwing pepper in parliament. those, who used to throw dust are now throwing pepper so that people fail to see the sins and the bad governance of congress.""on the issue of alleged displacement of sikh farmers from kutch region of gujarat, he said that it was a false propaganda from certain elements.""i assure that no sikh farmer will be displaced from kutch and gujarat,"" he said amidst applause from the gathering.""if any officer does anything wrong he will go but no sikh farmer will be displaced from gujarat,"" he said.""the people who are misguiding on the issue are posing a threat to the country,"" he said adding that ""the entire country is one"".he applauded that both punjabis and gujaratis are moving on the path of development and live together in many countries.on the issue of sad and bjp alliance, he said it is ""troubling congress as its policy of divide and rule had failed"".professing his love for punjab and its people, modi said that music and food of the state is a
