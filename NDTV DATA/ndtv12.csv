and second, in a post- evm election, we can go to the people with a narrative that you can now actually vote for your choice, earlier your vote was being stolen. this will be a morale booster for us. but, it is crucial that the entire opposition come together. even if one party blinks or baulks, then the 'brahmastra' (special weapon) becomes useless.""left unsaid was the elephant in the room - that the congress party, now led by rahul gandhi as president, will have to be a part of the plan for it to have even a shot at succeeding. the congress believes it has a good chance at re-election in karnataka where chief minister siddaramaiah has been countering the bjp challenge effectively by stoking kannadiga sub-nationalism on contentious issues such as the imposition of hindi.the congress will have to set aside its mistrust of opposition leaders to forge and lead this move. after nitish kumar's unexpected defection to the modi-led nda, gandhi is extremely bitter about putative allies. i asked a senior congress leader about the boycott plan and he answered sarcastically, ""we don't trust the evms, but we trust the leaders asking us to boycott the karnataka elections even less. but yes, we are thinking about it as the evms are certainly malfunctioning and the election commission has not been able to give a credible explanation as to why. the idea is good - but in karnataka, we (the congress) have the most to lose.""googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display(""adslotnativevideo"");

""i supervise the works in my father's assembly segment of shikaripura and varuna is comparatively more backward,"" he offers as evidence that a fledgling political cv should not be conflated with inexperience. varuna constituency is set to witness a high profile contestas he moves in a large suv, holding neighbourhood meetings and visiting temples, he is under the careful supervision of mr yedduyrappa's own trusted aides. dr yathindra, in contrast, operates virtually solo. the pathologist repositioned himself nearly two years ago after the sudden death of his older brother, who was also mr siddaramaiah's political heir in 2016.

""for the sake of his honour, we will ensure his son is elected from here. dr yathindra is aware of this, that's why when he comes to our village, he sticks to the roads that pass through the sc and obc areas, in our part he knows he will not get any votes,"" said a group of farmers in a village in varuna.the bjp is clear that apart from lingayats, it needs a coalition of supporters to combat those of mr siddramaiah's - hence the party's emotional outreach to the 42,000 scheduled caste votes in varuna. they are counted among the backers of mr siddaramaiah - but the bjp hopes to split their vote. ""the dalits hold the key to this election and will vote for us, because their strongest leader in the region, v srinivasa prasad, was humiliated by the chief minister,"" claims by vijayendra. mr prasad, a veteran congressman, joined the bjp last year after he was unceremoniously dropped from the cabinet. keeps up the charge.

""i want people to choose whether they will celebrate shivaji maharaj jayanti or tipu sultan jayanti,"" he told ndtv, using a riff introduced months earlier in the campaign for the southern state. a video of bjp lawmaker sanjay patil provoked anger ahead of karnataka assembly polls.karnataka votes in about three weeks on may 12. the congress, sans any recent electoral success, needs to win karnataka, one of just three states that it now controls. the bjp, meanwhile, is trying to reclaim the state where it formed its first southern government 10 years ago. and hindu-muslim rhetoric has been on tap since yogi adityanath entered the state with a series of yatras or tours that began in december. the chief minister of uttar pradesh belongs to a sect of priests who run a powerful math or seminary in mangaluru in coastal karnataka.it was there that the 45-year-old saffron-robed yogi publicly asked the people to ""choose between hanuman jayanti and tipu sultan jayanti"", denoting the congress as a pro-muslim party. two years ago, the congress government in karnataka decided to commemorate the birth anniversary of tipu sultan, provoking protests from the bjp. both sides have been furiously cherry-picking historical facts to create competing narratives of tipu, the 18th-century religious bigot who forced the conversion of hindus, versus tipu, the country's first freedom fighter who died while fighting the british to prevent the invasion of mysuru. karnataka elections: the siddaramaiah-led congress government is facing a stiff battle from the bjp.""whether in the past tipu sultan was a nationalist or anti-hindu, whether in the future a ram mandir will be built in ayodhya, how will these debates solve the problems i'm facing today?"" said manjunath, a sugarcane cultivator who lives about 30 kilometres from the border with maharashtra. farmers like him have not been paid for years by sugar mills who bought their crop. ""our mla has been saying that 'hindu versus muslims is the only issue in this election and not development'. so where does it leave us?"" he asked.manjunath is angry that despite the high number of farmer suicides in the state - over 600 between april and november last year - bjp leaders have not targeted the government of chief minister siddaramaiah over rural distress. instead, it is the alleged killing over the last four years of 24 activists linked to the sangh parivar that has driven the bjp's strategy in coastal karnataka, a decades-old frontier of hindu-muslim rivalry.the coastal belt consists of: dakshina or south kannada where muslims form 24 percent of the population, higher than the state average; the udupi district ; and uttara or north kannada. the bjp's ideological mentor, the rashtriya swayamsewak sangh or rss, has been a considerable force along the coast. attempts to challenge that have been made by the popular front of india (pfi), a radical islamist organisation founded in kerala in 2006.the bjp claims that since 2014, two dozen activists have been murdered by members of the pfi in coastal karnataka . police investigations have officially pointed to the involvement of pfi members in 10 of the 24 cases -the rest of the men were not victims of communal violence but family quarrels and land and business disputes, according to police documents. ""one of the alleged victims was found to be alive and even received an apology from bjp lawmaker shobha karandlaje who had first made the list public,"" an udupi-based journalist told ndtv.but at a public meeting in february in bengaluru, prime minister narendra modi said even his government was trying to facilitate ""ease of doing business"", there was ""ease of doing murder"" in karnataka.googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display(""adslotnativevideo""); });""coastal karnataka has never been this divided,"" charges suresh bhat bakrabail, an activist who is a member of the karnataka forum for communal harmony.the divide between the two communities, activists say, has sharpened after the last state election in which the bjp, wrecked by infighting, won just two of the 19 seats from the three districts of coastal karnataka. that's when the rss mobilized its formidable force of grassroots workers and delivered immediate results - barely a year later, the bjp won all three parliamentary seats in these areas.""we will once again sweep coastal karnataka,"" dr bharath shetty, a bjp candidate from mangaluru, told ndtv. ""people here are angry with the congress government for deliberately taking no action against the killers of hindu activists for fear of losing the minority vote."" he claims that there is no other election issue here except for the ""murderous attacks on the protectors of the hindu faith by members of the pfi."" he is contradicted by u rajesh naik, another bjp candidate, who says it's wrong to write off the importance of development - and the lack of it on the congress' watch. ""at the end of the day, all people want is a better life,"" he says. ""at the end of the day, all people want is a better life,"" says bjp candidate u rajesh naik.last year, according to data shared in parliament, there were 100 incidents of communal violence reported in karnataka which killed 9 people and injured more than 200, for which the bjp has publicly blamed the congress government, charging it with failing to protect hindus. spooked, chief minister siddaramaiah, a self-confessed agnostic, suddenly declared he was a hindu. ""ram is a part of my complete name which is sidda-rama,"" he said at public meetings and visited a series of major temples with congress president rahul gandhi to reassure voters that he was not anti-hindu. days later, it was yogi adityanath who countered on behalf of the bjp challenging the chief minister to prove his hindu credentials by banning cow slaughter in the state.that was at the start of the year. after march 14, when the yogi's homestead of gorakhpur voted against the bjp in a shock defeat for the party, the uttar pradesh chief minister has not returned to karnataka.filling in for him are a host of home-grown hindutva ambassadors, with union minister anant kumar hegde leading the pack. last year, he described secularists as ""people without parentage who didn't know their bloodline"". earlier this month. mr hedge - who, according to some in the party, has the potential to be groomed as its next chief minister - alleged he was the target of a failed assassination after an escort car in his convoy as hit by a truck driven by a muslim. the police said it was an accident; it turned out that the truck was owned by a relative of a bjp leader. union minister anant kumar hegde has faced several controversies, including being accused of communal hate speech.as opinion polls predict a fractured result, hordes of rss swayamsevaks or volunteers - local journalists put the figure at 50,000 - are covering the coastal belt, meeting voters and urging them to support a 'nationalist party'.

2018-04-27,talk of deve gowda's under-the-radar deal with bjp achieves scale,"mysuru: highlightsdeve gowda has tied up with mayawati for karnataka election but he has tacit pact with bjp, allege congress and others opinion polls predict fractured result. he could be king-makerwindow._pricee = window._pricee || []; _pricee.push({container : '_pcwgtmid'}); mayawati's indifference to being on time is not a new feature of her political persona. but when she showed up three hours late for a rally in karnataka on wednesday, it was interpreted as a cease-and-desist notice to her ally, hd deve gowda, over his allegedly growing proximity to the bjp - their supposed joint enemy.as the crowd waited in mysuru, it was left to mr gowda's son, hd kumaraswamy to furnish an explanation. ""mayawati is being pressured to end the alliance with us,"" he said to the 5,000-odd people waiting, not exactly a dream showing for a rally held this close to the state election on may 12. his comment acknowledged that talk of the partnership barely holding together is not off base.after behen-ji, as she is called by fans, finally showed up, a senior leader from her party, n mahesh told ndtv, ""she has no reason to doubt mr kumaraswamy's word."" mayawati attended a jds election rally in karnataka's mysuru on wednesday.but congress president rahul gandhi and several of her own party workers have alleged that mr gowda has an unadmitted understanding with the bjp which includes him putting up weak candidates against theirs in several constituencies.mr gandhi has called mr gowda's janata dal secular or jd(s) the ""b-team"" of the bjp in active pursuit of splitting the 10% percent muslim vote in the region of mysuru, traditionally loyal to the congress with the jds as its runner-up preference.mayawati has been assigned 20 seats as part of the alliance with mr gowda. his party gets the other 204.mr gowda, a former prime minister, says he had offered the congress an alliance but was rejected by chief minister siddaramaiah, who left the jd(s) about a decade ago to join the congress. his son, on the other hand, who has served as chief minister earlier, has maintained that teaming with the congress was unfeasible. karnataka elections: siddaramaiah vetoed a congress alliance with hd deve gowda's jds.when karnataka last voted in 2013, mr gowda's party got nearly half of its votes from forward or upper castes, in particular the vokkaligas, the prosperous land-holding community which the 84-year-old belongs. the rest of the party's votes came from backward castes and minorities - it won 11 of the 40 seats reserved in karnataka for candidates from disadvantaged groups.by feigning interest in the congress, mr gowda wanted to assure his minority voters that he was keen on forming an anti-bjp front. his son, on the other hand, wanted the vokkaligas to know that after the election, in case of a fractured result, as predicted by several opinion polls, his party was likely to work with the bjp. richer castes like the vokkaligas are far softer on the bjp than backward groups; they were also being assured that their votes would not go to waste, but in fact, could land solidly with a combination that would form the next government.""the vokkaligas do not trust mr siddaramiah after the new census conducted by his government in 2015 slashed their population in the state from 16 per cent to 11 per cent while scaling up the numbers of the scheduled castes and most backward castes. they fear that it may reduce their dominance in karnataka politics and government,"" said nagendra, who uses only one name and is an activist in one of the community's oldest organisations in the state, the vokkaligara sangha. ""the vokkaligas want to be assured that if they vote for the jd(s), the party will not support the congress after the election,"" he explained. bs yeddyurappa (second left) is the bjp's chief ministerial candidate for the 2018 karnataka elections.the caste census he referred to was never formally presented by mr siddaramaiah's government, but its findings were leaked, allegedly to benefit the chief minister because backward castes were shown as having significantly grown in size, while upper castes had reportedly shrunk.googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display(""adslotnativevideo""); });the vokkaligas are concentrated mainly in the eleven districts of south karnataka that form old mysuru. it is from here that the jd(s) won 24 of its 40 seats in 2013 (karnataka has a total of 224 seats). mr gowda, a former engineer, appeals to his community of farmers by labelling himself 'mannini maga' or ""son of the soil"".in the last state election, the bjp was a non-performer in old mysuru, but a year later, in the national election, according to this survey it cornered 38 percent of the area's vote share as compared, outstripping the jd(s) which got 31 percent. the bjp's surge was on account of the now-legendary modi wave.the lead over mr gowda and his party will hold, claims the bjp parliamentarian from mysuru, pratap simha, who is also a vokkaliga and says the community's loyalty to the former premier has expired.

_pricee.push({container : '_pcwgtmid'}); the assembly election in karnataka, due on may 12, is seen as a high stakes battle between congress chief minister siddaramaiah and prime minister narendra modi, who is going all out to win back the first southern state the party had ruled. opinion polls, however, have not given a clear majority to either party and increasingly, it appears that prime minister hd deve gowda's janata dal (secular) may have the power to decide the outcome.the results of a poll of opinion polls - an average of the opinion poll results - conducted in january and since, show a slight decline for the bjp. but this is not much different from the scenario that would have been there after the 2013 assembly polls, had bs yeddyurappa been a part of the bjp. mr yeddyurappa, who led the bjp to a victory in 2008 and became the chief minister, had to step down following corruption charges. he walked out of the bjp and contested the 2013 elections at the head of his own party. he rejoined bjp within a year and is the bjp's chief ministerial candidate this time. the battle for karnataka is expected to be a close fight - a vote swing of 3 to 4 per cent either way can deliver a majority to the congress, or the bjp. googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display(""adslotnativevideo""); });the congress is going to need only a 3 per cent swing for a majority - most of its gains could come from areas with a substantial population of scheduled castes and tribes. for the bjp, a 4 per cent vote swing is necessary for an outright victory. it could be possible if the lingayats, traditional supporters of the party, continue to vote for it in face of the congress move to swing the votes in its favour by giving the community the minority religion status. the leaders of all three parties - congress chief minister siddaramaiah, bjp's yeddyurappa and jd(s) leader hd kumaraswamy, the son of mr deve gowda - have expressed confidence about a clear verdict. past experience shows that the state has given a hung verdict only in 15 per cent of the 14 assembly elections held till date. for the rest, the verdict was clear. caste is expected to be one of the key influencing factors in the state. lingayat politics have dominated much of the campaign, with the community being able to influence the outcome in 62 seats. an equal number of seats can be influenced by the scheduled castes and tribes - followed by vokkaligas, kurubas and the muslims. the bjp has traditionally been the big gainer in the lingayat belt, the congress has had a moderate advantage in the muslim belt. the jd(s) gains in the areas dominated by the vokkaligas. one assembly seat in karnataka has managed to remain the bellwether seat for a dozen elections -- assembly and lok sabha -- and is the most watched seat in the state. shirahatti, named after a panchayat town in central karnataka's gadag district -- has managed to vote for the winning party in the state and centre. its streak has continued for seven assembly and five lok sabha elections. shirahatti is followed by yelburga, also in central karnataka, which got the winning party right five times. six other seats voted for the winning party in four assembly elections in the state. elections for karnataka's 224 seats will be held on may 12. the results will be declared on may 15.",0.10789005032907473,"assembly elections karnataka play , numbers","bengaluru : highlightsthe battle karnataka expected close fight exit polls given clear majority either bjp congress vote swing 3 4 per cent deliver majority either partywindow._pricee = window._pricee &#124;

2018-04-29,modi seems to sense karnataka will reject him," does mr modi have a premonition about losing the karnataka election? if not, why he is keeping his distance? he has a series of rallies coming up there now and it could be argued that he was saving his energy for the final stretch, that he has full faith in his right-hand man and bjp president amit shah, that he believes that the return of bs yeddyurappa to the bjp will be enough for the party to win. it could also be argued that his schedule is too tight to accommodate the election campaign. he has just been to england and met pm may and at the time of writing, he is in china to improve relations there.these are good arguments but i don't buy them. modi is not one who trusts others to make the difference between winning and losing. he is a one-man army and is more comfortable at rallies and road shows than in his south block office. therefore, if he is missing from the scene, then there should be some reason.modi is planning only 15 rallies in the state, starting may 1. karnataka is a crucial election for him for two reasons. first, he has to prove wrong the growing talk that he is no longer as popular as he used to be. he had a tough time winning gujarat, which was considered his private borough. the bjp's tripura victory was certainly one of the great upsets of indian politics but the defeat of the bjp in gorakhpur and phulpur as also in by-elections in rajasthan and madhya pradesh were big embarrassments. so a karnataka win could psychologically restore people's confidence in his leadership.second, rahul gandhi has undoubtedly improved his image since the gujarat election. he looks more confident and his attacks on modi have been sharp. his social and mainstream media management look energised. as congress president, rahul has been asserting his authority. he is trying to balance young leaders with seasoned ones. in karnataka, if the congress is able to defend its government, voters will believe that the party is capable of winning. pm modi has planned 15 rallies in karnataka ahead of the may 12 electionmodi has not been seen in karnataka since february 27 when yeddyurappa was endorsed on his birthday as the bjp's chief ministerial candidate. let me remind you that for the gujarat election, modi was there almost every other week. as soon as he realised that the bjp was weaker there than anticipated, he almost camped there and took total control.he knew that the patidars and business class were unhappy with the bjp while dalits were upset after the thrashing of young men in una. to appease the business community and patidars, he held an 11-km long roadshow in surat in april. it was speculated that around 50,000 young men and women participated in the convoy on their bikes. a saree was seen stretched through out the road depicting modi government's achievements. modi won 15 seats out of 16 in surat area.similarly, another mega-show was organised in rajkot in june. this was huge. modi arrived on june 29, and led a 12-km long road show. the whole city was lit with coloured lights. hoardings and cut outs flooded the whole town. light and sound shows were organised. the whole city was shown in a festive mood. such events do make an impact and affect voting behaviour. in rajkot, the bjp won 5 of 8 seats. party president amit shah has been a major campaigner for the bjp in karnatakaduring september - october 2017, modi had five trips to gujarat. and every trip was organised on a bigger scale, with a lot of pomp and show. while the election commission dithered over announcing the voting dates and was accused of serving the bjp as a result, allowing the state government to announce projects and sops of approximately rs 11,000.googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display(""adslotnativevideo""); });let's do a cross check with history also. modi, this time in 2013, was yet to be announced as the prime ministerial candidate. in its then government in karnataka, the bjp had experimented with three chief ministers in five years. and finally, yeddyurappa rebelled and formed his own party. the bjp's defeat in the state was obvious. modi knew this. he was reluctant to campaign there. he addressed only three rallies.now he is doing the same. as a smart politician, he would not like to avail the blame for the humiliation. so he is letting amit shah fight the battle. just like in bihar, in 2015, when he avoided the last stretch of campaigning.(ashutosh joined the aam aadmi party in january 2014.)disclaimer: the opinions expressed within this article are the personal opinions of the author. the facts and opinions appearing in the article do not reflect the views of ndtv and ndtv does not assume any responsibility or liability for the same.",0.15093351548269576,modi seems sense karnataka reject,"mr modi premonition losing karnataka election ?

2018-04-30,karnataka election could see much-needed sizzle with modi rallies," was sunday evening's hailstorm in bengaluru that broke a long heat wave a portent of change? did it indicate that this dreary assembly election which has been dragging on since the beginning of the year will finally spark up -- and could modi be what ignites it?if recent elections in gujarat and uttar pradesh are any indication, that is exactly what will happen starting tomorrow when pm modi launches his 15 rallies over five days. whatever one's political predilections, modi is without doubt leagues ahead of the rest of the pack in campaigning. in gujarat, he managed to turn a certain loss into a small and face-saving victory. and it is his unbeatable ability to reach out to voters that makes him all-powerful in the bjp.so far in karnataka, the sound and fury of an indian election missing. no posters, banners, no corner meetings. yes, there are political rallies, social media wars and tv ads, but no one seems particularly excited about the election.of the three contenders for chief minister, the bjp's bs yeddyurappa looks like a tired warhorse. if the bjp comes to power, it will not be his victory nor may he spend much time as chief minister.but can the prime minister cross the language barrier? can his translated message have the same impact as asking gujaratis to vote for the son of their land? congress leaders don't think so and claim that his hindi message will be lost in this secular and multicultural state. at the moment, there is no sense of an anti-incumbency wave against siddaramaiah.but as you travel north from bengaluru, the very cosmopolitan capital of the state, you realise that hindi is not such an alien language as is being made out. whether it is in villages or small towns, there seem to be enough hindi speakers for one to talk to about the election. and if there's one hindi speaker in a family that provides a network to spread the message. secondly, it seems that modi may have caught the imagination of the youth in karnataka as he has elsewhere. to them, he still represents hope for the future. and if modi can turn their latent support into votes, the election may be a hit for the bjp.since the last time karnataka voted in 2013, more than 70 lakh new voters have registered and are 15 per cent of all voters. as battleground karnataka, prannoy roy's analysis show pointed out, in a state where a 4-5 per cent swing could see the bjp collecting a majority, the youth vote is very potent. and despite his youth, rahul gandhi does not seem to have become an icon for these voters.not that the bjp is depending only on modi to stir up the voters in karnataka. it is sending its chief communal weapon, yogi adityanath, to blitz the state in the last week of campaigning. despite a seemingly unimpressive response to his earlier visits to the state, the party clearly believes there is a strong latent hindu vote that can be woken up and galvanised to push the bjp home. again, as battleground pointed out, in seats that can be classified as muslim, the bjp's vote share is higher than its average because of the consolidation of hindu votes. furthermore, one should remember that in 2014, the bjp won 17 of the 28 lok sabha seats, garnering 43 per cent of the vote. anything close to that kind of support will have them dancing to power in the state. of the three contenders for chief minister, the bjp's bs yeddyurappa looks like a tired warhorsebehind all this, the third point of the trishul, amit shah, has been crisscrossing the state for months campaigning and organising bjp workers for this great southern assault. with money in the bag, amit shah is able to fund the campaign to the maximum while the poorer congress struggles.googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display(""adslotnativevideo""); });and money is not only important in campaigning but is decisive in cobbling together a coalition if the karnataka house is hung. if opinion polls are correct in forecasting that, it's advantage bjp because amit shah has shown in goa and the north east that he is the master of this game.the problem for amit shah is that if the house is hung, unless the bjp has over 100 seats, the only coalition partner available is hd kumaraswamy's jds. kumaraswamy is very confident of his vokkaliga base and believes that the coalition with mayawati's bsp will provide the impetus to dalits to support his party and push the jds beyond 50 seats to give him that power. the jds and bjp have coalesced before in 2006; though the alliance collapsed 20 months later, it could be an experiment repeated now. while kumaraswamy categorical rejects such a possibility, he refuses to accept, as he told ndtv, that 2006 was a mistake. he says he is going to be king and not kingmaker, clearly telling both the congress and the bjp that a coalition will only be acceptable if he is made chief minister. if the house is hung, unless the bjp has over 100 seats, the only coalition partner available is hd kumaraswamy's jdsthis may be difficult for the congress as chief minister siddaramaiah has said he would never make up with the jds (he split from it in 2005), so unless the congress ditches siddaramaiah, the bjp may well score kumaraswamy. and that may not be a problem in the short term for the bjp, whose eyes are on 2019. by ousting the congress in karnataka, they would kill talk of the congress being within striking range of a comeback. they would also bargain hard to get the lion's share of the lok sabha seats at the expense of kumaraswamy.while all this seems to suggest that siddaramaiah is in trouble, that may not be completely accurate. at the moment, there is no sense of an anti-incumbency wave. he told ndtv that he is very confident that the many programmes has launched for the poor will help him back to power. he is confident that the communal card will fail and in a state with a large st/sc (he himself is from the backward kuruba community) and muslim population, and minority tamiland telugu populations, he can attract the 40 per cent vote needed to put the congress over the top.moreover, his acquiescing to the long-standing lingayat demand to be recognised as a separate religion seems to have influenced some of the lingayats who without saying they would support the congress have been actively asking their followers to vote for what is best for lingayats. if this breaks the bjp hold on this community, siddaramaiah could stroll home.(ishwari bajpai is senior advisor at ndtv.)disclaimer: the opinions expressed within this article are the personal opinions of the author. the facts and opinions appearing in the article do not reflect the views of ndtv and ndtv does not assume any responsibility or liability for the same.",0.0912901652338272,karnataka election could see much-needed sizzle modi rallies,"sunday evening ' hailstorm bengaluru broke long heat wave portent change ? indicate dreary assembly election dragging since beginning year finally spark -- could modi ignites it?if recent elections gujarat uttar pradesh indication , exactly happen starting tomorrow pm modi launches 15 rallies five days. whatever one ' political predilections , modi without doubt leagues ahead rest pack campaigning. gujarat , managed turn certain loss small face-saving victory. unbeatable ability reach voters makes all-powerful bjp.so far karnataka , sound fury indian election missing. posters , banners , corner meetings. yes , political rallies , social media wars tv ads , one seems particularly excited election.of three contenders chief minister , bjp ' bs yeddyurappa looks like tired warhorse. bjp comes power , victory may spend much time chief minister.but prime minister cross language barrier ? translated message impact asking gujaratis vote son land ? congress leaders ' think claim hindi message lost secular multicultural state. moment , sense anti-incumbency wave siddaramaiah.but travel north bengaluru , cosmopolitan capital state , realise hindi alien language made out. whether villages small towns , seem enough hindi speakers one talk election.

2018-05-09,the swing factor in karnataka assembly elections - prannoy roy's analysis,"bengaluru: karnataka, where the bjp is fighting tooth and nail to wrest power from the congress, votes in four days for a new government. opinion polls have predicted a hung verdict in the state.data from the past elections shows that anti-incumbency has not been the trend in recent years. increasingly, the state has been re-electing sitting legislators. the trend has been replicated in the lok sabha elections as well -- 2004 was the median year after which the balance tilted. claims of winning with a majority have also been made by congress's chief minister siddaramaiah, who is seeking a second term in power, and the man he terms his chief rival - bjp's presumptive chief minister bs yeddyurappa. former prime minister hd deve gowda's janata dal secular, which is expected to play a big role in case of a hung verdict, has claimed it will support neither congress nor the bjp. the party, which has teamed up with mayawati, the dalit powerhouse from uttar pradesh, claims it will make a clean sweep.caste is expected to be a key factor in this election. but there is no trend of any caste voting en-masse for any party.from lingayats in the north and central parts of the state to vokkaligas in the south to scheduled castes and tribes in the eastern zone, the dominant party has a certain advantage. in the coastal areas, the mixed castes are evenly divided between the congress and the bjp. data also shows that while caste influences the levels of support, other issues can override it and cause a pro-congress or a pro-bjp swing. to get a complete majority in the 224-seat assembly, the bjp needs a 4 per cent swing, the congress needs 3 percent.the list that could affect that swing stars prime minister narendra modi and karnataka chief minister siddaramaiah. in karnataka, even a minor swing can translate to a big difference in results. but data shows that almost every region swings in the same direction as the rest of the state, even though the levels may vary. googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display(""adslotnativevideo"");

2018-05-15,"karnataka assembly election results today, counting begins at 8 am","bengaluru: votes for the crucial karnataka assembly elections will be counted today, revealing the outcome of a much anticipated electoral battle with significant ramifications for next year's national polls. political observers have said the result would likely go down to the wire, with a neck-and-neck race between the state's ruling congress and challenger bjp. several exit polls have predicted a hung assembly, and said former prime minister h d deve gowda's janata dal secular or jd(s) would play the role of the kingmaker.in one of the most high-profile and bitterly fought elections in recent times, 222 of the 224 seats went to polls on may 12. polling for r r nagar seat was deferred on account of alleged electoral malpractices, while it was countermanded in jayanagar seat following the death of a bjp candidate. counting of votes would begin at 8 am in nearly 40 counting centres, election office sources said. the trends are likely to begin to trickle within an hour and all results are expected to be declared by late evening.in case of a clear verdict in favour of the congress, the grand old party will have broken the jinx of no political party retaining the reins of the state since 1985, when the erstwhile janata dal formed the government under ramakrishna hegde for a second consecutive term.it is, however, unclear if siddaramaiah will be the next chief minister in the event of a congress victory. though the congress had said he would be its face in the elections, it stopped short of declaring him the party's chief ministerial candidate.siddaramaiah caused a political flutter when he said on sunday that he was ready to make way for a dalit chief minister if the congress high command so decided, a statement many felt was aimed at keeping the jd(s) in good humour so as to stitch an alliance in case of a fractured mandate.siddramaiah is a former jd(s) man and his ties with deve gowda's party continue to be strained. ""i am confident that the congress would win the elections with a majority and i would be the cm,"" siddaramaiah had told journalists earlier.however, when asked yesterday if he was ready to make way for a dalit leader as chief minister, he said, ""i have no objection. i am not against anybody but the decision has to be left to the high command.""he, however, said the high command would also consider the views of the winning candidates before deciding the next chief minister. since the congress had not declared its chief ministerial candidate, dalit veterans in the party like its leader in the lok sabha mallikarjun kharge and state congress chief g parameshwara are being seen as possible alternatives.kharge had recently told pti he was ready to take up any role assigned to him by the party. a victory in karnataka would help boost the sagging morale of the congress, which is on a downhill journey, losing state after state since narendra modi came to power at the centre.googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display(""adslotnativevideo""); });losing karnataka will drastically weaken its claim for the leadership of a broader anti-bjp alliance that is being talked about.a victory for the bjp, on the other hand, will reflect the enduring charisma of prime minister narendra modi and his capacity to power his party to victory across the country, clearing demographic and topographical obstacles.it would also further galvanise the bjp cadre before the assembly elections in party-ruled rajasthan, madhya pradesh and chhattisgarh later this year. the jd(s) has also claimed it would win a majority and that its chief ministerial candidate h d kumaraswamy will be the ""king"" and not the ""kingmaker"".the party may or may not win the elections, but will play the kingmaker if the electorate give a split verdict,making deve gowda an important player in the state politicsonce again.with the jd(s) having had partnered with both bjp and congress in the past, it would be tough to predict which way it will go this time in the event of a hung house.one of the possible scenarios could be the coming together ofthe congress and the jd(s), as had happenedin2004 when they formed the government under congress heavyweight dharm singh after the state elected a hung house.if that happens, jd(s) may not agree to siddaramaiah heading a coalition government and likely want a dalit leader at the helm.

""the difficulty with whatsapp is that it's impossible to know how this information is spreading. it's very easy for a political party to spread misinformation and no one can trace it back to them.""whatsapp is not as widely used in the united states, and when facebook purchased it in 2014, observers were shocked by its $19 billion price. but chief executive mark zuckerberg coveted whatsapp because of its global reach: it has greater penetration than facebook in parts of the world.in places such as brazil and mexico, the app is the most common service not only for texting and calling between friends and family but also for businesses - from doctors to hair salons to news organizations - to communicate with clients.whatsapp's largest market is in india, where it has more than 200 million users. indians sent each other more than 20 billion new year's eve greetings via whatsapp this year. and whatsapp is testing a new payments feature to expand its reach.almost from the beginning, whatsapp messages have been used to incite mob violence in india. whatsapp rumors about child abductions led to the murder of three people in tamil nadu state last week.in india's election, facebook has teamed with the fact-checking website boom to review related content. yet little has been done in this cycle to combat incendiary content on whatsapp. representatives of the messaging service were in india in recent days to meet with civil society groups and discuss next year's election.""we're working to give people more control over groups and are constantly evolving our tools to block automated content,"" a whatsapp spokesman said in a statement. ""in the run-up to next year's election in india we're stepping up our education efforts so that people know about our safety features, as well as how to spot fake news and hoaxes.""facebook executives have clashed with whatsapp's leadership on a host of issues, including privacy and how to profit off whatsapp's broad base of users. its co-founder, jan koum, resigned last month in part over facebook's attempts to collect more detailed information. in turn, facebook executives have been frustrated over whatsapp's inability to stem the tide of fake news or control illegal content shared on the platform.prime minister narendra modi, who marched to victory in 2014 backed by an unprecedented social media operation, has thousands of whatsapp warriors running grass-roots groups. a review of their posts show some contain warnings about muslims - a tactic to unite the loyal hindu base.""reaching out to each home and promoting one's manifesto is easier and faster than ever before,"" said vikas puttur, a spokesman for modi's bharatiya janata party in mangalore. ""we get to know the ground reality in moments.""mangalore is a tidy city in the state of karnataka of about 625,000 people, with palm trees and terra-cotta roof homes. but its languid seaside air is belied by strain between majority hindus and a largely affluent muslim minority, many of whom have embraced a stricter form of islam fostered by ties to the persian gulf.puttur, 32, a polished mba with roots in india's hindu nationalist rashtriya swayamsevak sangh, denied that the party spreads fake or religiously tinged material but said its main opponent, indian national congress party, does. congress denies this, but its supporters have spread fake news about a bjp worker arrested with millions for voter payouts, among other falsehoods.googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display(""adslotnativevideo""); });puttur played a widely circulated video of a muslim politician from the opposing party, zameer ahmed khan, translating khan's fiery speech as a pledge to ""butcher all the hindus.""in fact, according to an analysis by the fact-checking website alt news, khan said, ""if i am made a minister, in five years i will do such work that my name will appear in the guinness record."" alt news found that fake news had spiked from all political parties but ""misinformation that is spread by bjp supporters on social media is often communal in nature.""asked about this discrepancy, puttur said, ""i have told you what he actually meant.""indian officials, feeling helpless to stop the spread of whatsapp content, have resorted to shutting the internet down in tense places, with more than 70 stoppages last year compared with six in 2014, according to internet shutdowns tracker portal.brazil has also shut down the service periodically, after company executives refused to share data requested by authorities.other countries are experimenting with how to monitor whatsapp content.in colombia, a news website called la silla vacia launched a ""whatsapp detector"" last year, allowing users to submit whatsapp messages to be fact-checked. hotlines have been established by activists in mexico and by the egyptian government, enabling people to report stories they feel are false or, in the case of egypt, that endanger ""the nation's security or public interests.""the whatsapp spokesman said that if there is a safety concern, the company may be able to block bad actors on both whatsapp and facebook. while executives cannot scan content, they can view phone numbers and profile photos and connect whatsapp accounts with facebook accounts to gather clues about unwanted activity, such as terrorism, child pornography and spam. they are looking to do more in the future, the spokesman said.""political parties in india have been using whatsapp to organize for some time,"" the spokesman said. ""this has all been done without help from whatsapp. the karnataka election is teaching us more about what's happening and how to help prevent spam more effectively.""in early december, in the coastal town of honnavar in karnataka, the body of an 18-year-old fisherman's son named paresh mesta was found floating in a pond. police believe he was swept up in a clash between muslims and hindus at a local temple.rumors - repeated by prominent members of the bjp - quickly spread on whatsapp that the boy's body had been mutilated, and riots broke out.""when he was found, he was mutilated, castrated, burnt by boiling oil poured over his head & his head split dastardly with a weapon,"" shobha karandlaje, a bjp member of parliament, tweeted on dec. 10. the state bjp issued a statement repeating karandlaje's claims that jihadi ""elements"" killed mesta and accused police of a coverup.police took the unusual step of releasing the forensic examiner's response to these charges, who noted two abrasions that may have been the result of ""blunt force trauma"" but no other injuries. a religious tattoo said to have been scraped from his body was intact.in the small fishing village where mesta's grieving parents still live, young men crowded around to show whatsapp forwards they had received that fueled their anger - karandlaje's posts, as well as a grisly video one onlooker took of mesta's blackened body as it was pulled from the pond.police ultimately arrested five muslim men in the case, which was turned over to india's central bureau of investigation, and later filed a complaint against karandlaje for provoking enmity between religious groups. she declined to comment, but on social media vowed to continue her fight with the hashtag #hindulivesmatter.""",-0.0010346947738252132,"karnataka india ' "" whatsapp first election "" : foreign media","mangalore : forget debates rallies. elections india fought whatsapp , facebook-owned messaging app used millions people make calls , chat share information.but service also providing unfiltered platform fake news religious hatred , activists observers say.in high-profile state election month , seen preview india ' national election next year , country ' two major political parties claimed amassed 20,000 whatsapp groups , boasting could reach 1.5 million loyalists minutes. messages false inflammatory , twisting words political opponents ratcheting tensions hindu nationalists country ' muslim minority. india ' "" whatsapp first "" election , dubbed , comes time parent company facebook accused undermining democracy failing control russian disinformation , inaccurate news hate speech. developing countries myanmar sri lanka , false stories facebook sparked riots , lynchings religious violence. united states , accounts run russian operatives shared disinformation divisive messages 126 million people. karnataka saw high-pitched election campaign past weeks. activists many parts world say whatsapp - used 1.5 billion people globally known encrypted messages even company executives ' read - presents even greater challenge democracy.the platform rife abuse many users new internet digitally literate , activists say. conversations happen within private groups , difficult broader public correct false information.

2018-05-16,"in his ""last election"", siddaramaiah's biggest beneficiaries ditch him","bengaluru, karnataka: the free fall of the congress in karnataka - it slid yesterday from 122 to 78 seats - was caused largely because it failed to improve its standing among the state's most backward castes despite chief minister siddaramaiah focusing on them through schemes that provided free milk to students and free grain to the poorest families.of the 224 seats in karnataka, 51 are reserved for scheduled castes and scheduled tribes; the congress cornered just 18 as compared to 26 in the last state election.that is just one of the many samples of the unravelling of mr siddaramaiah's famed ""ahinda"" grouping of dalits, muslims and backward castes which enabled him to defeat the bjp five years ago.karnataka has 101 sub-castes dalits who together form 20 percent of the state's population. in local parlance and calculus, they are broadly divided between the chalavadis, referred to as ""right hand"" and traditionally supporters of the congress, and the madigas or the ""left hand"", who are larger in size and have for decades backed the bjp. the ""left hand"" feel the congress has blocked their political and economic empowerment to favour their rivals. for karnataka loss, many congressmen have blamed mr siddaramaiahthe congress held onto its ""right hand"" base. but mr siddaramaiah's overtures to the ""left hand"" fell totally flat. this, combined with a downsizing of the congress' limited popularity among upper castes scripted the party's plunge in an election that has been entirely about caste.the ""right hand"" dalits have over the years backed the congress as it promoted leaders from among them - former union minister mallikarjun kharge, for example, and, g parameshwara, who is the party chief in karnataka. their prominence, allege ""left hand"" dalits, is among wide-ranging evidence of how they are ignored and benefits of reservation, government jobs and seats in colleges, for example, are cornered by their rivals. to placate them, mr siddaramaiah inducted madiga leaders in his cabinet, appointed several members of the community to key positions in state institutions and chose some of them as candidates for this election.""but there was an undercurrent of anger against the congress for not implementing the sadashiva commission report - submitted in 2012 to the bjp government - which recommended internal reservation amongst the 101 scheduled castes based on their numbers,"" said dr l hanumanthaiah, a madiga, who was elected to the rajya sabha from karnataka in march after being handpicked by mr siddaramaiah.the report calling for prioritisation within sub-castes of dalits would have benefited the left hand madigas the most since they are the dominant group, he explained. ""if mr siddaramaiah had acted on the report as soon as he came to power instead of reaching out to the community at the last minute, we would not have faced this rout. i blame him for the split in the dalit vote, for not doing anything for so long,"" he charged.meanwhile, the bjp stepped up its effort to consolidate the madiga or left hand vote. party chief amit shah in march visited the powerful matt of madhara chennaiah in chitradurga in central karnataka which saw its head seer endorsing the bjp. ""we had a very rewarding meeting,"" he told ndtv. ""the bjp president has assured us that if the party came to power they would implement the sadashiva committee report and meet the longstanding demand of the madiga community for internal reservation. this will definitely cost the congress our support."" in chitradurga district, where dalits make up nearly 22% of the population and in other parts of central karnataka, mutts, which are large seminaries, hold tremendous power. here, the bjp won 21 of the 36 seats bjp chief amit shah visited the karnataka's powerful matt of madhara chennaiah in chitradurgain the adjoining districts of the telugu-speaking hyderabad karnataka region (north-east karnataka), which are culturally and linguistically distinct from central karnataka, the bjp adopted a different strategy.""the congress talks of dalits and their welfare, but didn't make a dalit the chief minister. instead, they held a secret ballot and made a man who changed three parties (janata dal, jds and congress) their chief minister,"" prime minister narendra modi said at a rally. he was referring to 2013, when mallikarjun kharge was bested by mr siddaramaiah to become head of the congress government. the pm's remark was made in mr kharge's constituency.this one statement, many believe, cost the congress heavily in the hyderabad-karnataka region: it won just 15 seats here as opposed to 25 in 2013.googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display(""adslotnativevideo""); });the bjp ran the election with bs yeddyurappa of the upper lingayat caste as its presumptive chief minister. as his deputy, it picked tribal leader b sriramulu, a move that upped its popularity among dalits. mr sriramulu, who lost one of the two constituencies he contested, is a close aide of the infamous reddy brothers, mining barons who are accused of giant corruption. since he came to power in 2014, the pm has tried to consolidate the scheduled castes behind the bjp so that it is no longer counted as a party powered by upper caste votes. from nominating a dalit as president to building monuments to dr ambedkar, he has tried to convince backward castes that hindutva ideology is not hostile to their survival and growth.however, in karnataka last year, dalit anger erupted after union minister anant kumar hegde, who is an upper caste leader from the state, said that the bjp was planning to amend the constitution. this could impact the protection guaranteed to dalits through affirmative action policies, the community feared. but the congress failed to mobilise this anger in the election or link it to the vast dalit anger across the country over a recent supreme court verdict that political parties say has weakened a key law that punishes discrimination against dalits.""on the other hand, the bjp was more successful in consolidating its upper caste constituency which had welcomed the supreme court order and increasingly views dalit empowerment as a stumbling block to its own advancement,"" claims mavalli shankar, an activist with a dalit rights group called the dalit sangharsh samiti. this view is endorsed by mr hanumanthaiah who alleges that his party leaders did not speak up clearly and loudly against recent crimes against dalits in states like gujarat and uttar pradesh because congress campaigners stuck to their own script and region. ""nowhere did they campaign together, or condemn the violence with one voice, but stayed put in their own constituencies. when the congress leadership itself appeared so divided, how did they expect to inspire confidence in the community and consolidate the dalit vote?""what will not ease the ache from this backlash among dalits is that in trying to win their support, mr siddaramaiah ignored and alienated upper castes.he called for the lingayats, a rich caste, to be recognised as a minority religion. the gambit was to break the bjp's hold over them. instead, the lingayats appear to agree with the bjp's allegation that mr siddaramaiah's tactic sought to divide a united hindu society by carving out a separate standing for the lingayats.of 62 seats decided by the lingayats, the congress won 21 compared to 47 in 2013. siddaramaiah called for the lingayats, a rich caste, to be recognised as a minority religion.mr siddaramaiah has declared this his last election. the congress is now attempting to form the government with regional party janata dal (secular). governor vajubhai vala has to decide whether to give the alliance a shot at proving its strength or whether that is the prerogative of mr yeddyurappa since the bjp won the most seats (but not an outright majority).till the result was known, there was talk of the likelihood of mr siddaramaiah being given national stature by his party if he broke karnataka's trend of never re-electing the incumbent. today, a series of congressmen have laid the blame for their loss entirely on his decisions. it may be logical but it is the rude reality of his defeat.",0.07456174777603347,""" last election "" , siddaramaiah ' biggest beneficiaries ditch","bengaluru , karnataka : free fall congress karnataka - slid yesterday 122 78 seats - caused largely failed improve standing among state ' backward castes despite chief minister siddaramaiah focusing schemes provided free milk students free grain poorest families.of 224 seats karnataka , 51 reserved scheduled castes scheduled tribes ; congress cornered 18 compared 26 last state election.that one many samples unravelling mr siddaramaiah ' famed "" ahinda "" grouping dalits , muslims backward castes enabled defeat bjp five years ago.karnataka 101 sub-castes dalits together form 20 percent state ' population. local parlance calculus , broadly divided chalavadis , referred "" right hand "" traditionally supporters congress , madigas "" left hand "" , larger size decades backed bjp.

2018-05-16,why congress defeat in karnataka is a respectable one," remember how the bjp mocked the congress for declaring it had won a ""moral victory"" in gujarat? it looks very much like they should have stayed silent instead. because in karnataka, the bjp, in spite of pulling out all the stops, has fallen short of real victory, and may well have to settle for a moral one. unless they manage to buy themselves a few jd(s) or congress mlas, in which case they will have transformed a moral victory into an immoral one.there's little doubt that the congress has little to celebrate about. it got resoundingly thumped in coastal karnataka - the laboratory of all the rss' nasty little polarisation experiments - and its hope of power going forward depends on playing second fiddle to a party with far fewer seats. but, on the other hand, let's also be clear that there are enough reasons for the congress to nevertheless hold its head up high. for one, it increased its vote share over 2013 by more than a percentage point. that's no mean achievement in a state that's known above all for throwing out incumbents.yet the bjp, as well, has a bit of introspection to do. it has come to rely far too much on the prime minister's charisma, and its own belief that it will shape the narrative to its advantage. in the cause of a ""congress-mukt bharat"", any kind of compromise is considered permissible. the no-leaders-above-75 rule is broken for b s yeddyurappa. a party that makes an enormous amount of noise about corruption and black money embraces the reddys of bellary, india's greatest examples of the mining mafia-politics nexus. the tenor of their campaign ceased to be about their vaunted ""development"" focus and instead emphasised issues they thought likely to bring about hindu-muslim polarisation, the party president even tweeting that the congress and pakistan were alike in honouring tipu sultan. bjp's no-leaders-above-75 rule is broken for bs yeddyurappa.so what are we to make of this split decision that's been handed to us? there's a great deal of audible moaning about the ""messiness"" of the result. it doesn't look particularly messy, actually. the simple facts are these: the bjp is nine seats away from a majority, and the congress - jd(s) together well over the halfway mark. and let's not listen to any sanctimonious pablum about ""the will of the people"". the will of the people is quite clear when a party wins a comfortable majority. the will of the people in a hung legislature is that their chosen representatives sit down and work out what will best serve their constituents. the people of karnataka may not have voted to have the siddaramaiah government back, but neither have they voted for bsy. and you know what? they should in fairness get neither.addressing the press shortly after meeting the karnataka governor, h d kumaraswamy - the man who will be chief minister, presumably, if the jd(s)-congress are permitted to show their strength on the floor of the new house - recalled a certain ""operation"" in 2008 and warned the bjp against repeating it. what was this ""operation"" precisely? well, it was a masterclass in cynicism, launched by the karnataka bjp in 2008 in which b s yeddyurappa converted a minority government into a majority one by buying out one opposition mla after another. bsy went on to run a singularly corrupt government, one dominated by land scams touching the chief minister himself, and shadowed by the outsize corruption of the reddys. this was the last time that the bjp was in power in karnataka; in 2013, the congress easily beat a divided bjp, which had by then parted ways with bsy. rahul gandhi stayed committed to electioneering, and demonstrated he is a far better speaker than he was a few years agoif the bjp was to attempt a repeat of operation lotus, as it was then called, it would no doubt be successful. yet it is hard to take the bjp's constant paeans to its moral superiority seriously when it is essentially announcing to the world that it is dependent on bribery and corruption to win through to power, and will do so anyway. though that willingness should not be a surprise -- look at the way that the reddys and bsy have been brought back into the fold, regardless of the prime minister's unflagging and repetitive rhetoric about corruption.googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display(""adslotnativevideo""); });would the congress be able to reap any rhetorical advantage from these compromises by the bjp? a year ago, i would have said: no. but, today, all bets are off. the congress has not won this election, but its performance has been surprisingly robust. it dominated the social media narrative, it empowered its local satrap, who rose to the occasion - and continues to do so even after the polls closed, helping to broker a deal with the party he left in high dudgeon. rahul gandhi stayed committed to electioneering, and demonstrated he is a far better speaker than he was a few years ago. it ran a campaign that was based on issues, created a strong narrative of its own - federalism and sub-national rights - and defended its record in office vigorously. in all ways, this is the kind of performance from the opposition that all of those who have been bemoaning that ""there is no opposition"" to modi have long demanded. but, again, it wasn't enough to win. perhaps those people blaming the modi phenomenon on the ""quality"" of the ""opposition"" were talking through their hat all along. the people of karnataka may not have voted to have the siddaramaiah government back, but neither have they voted for bs yeddyurappait's hard to draw conclusions from state politics that are applicable to the national stage. but we're now a year away from the general elections, and it's equally hard not to. and perhaps we are fortunate that the karnataka election has turned out the way it has, because it allows us to think through what would happen if, in 2019, the nda - still propelled by modi's personal popularity, but little else - comes close enough to victory, but falls short. will the congress have the large-heartedness on that occasion that it has displayed in the somewhat less consequential matter of the karnataka chief minister-ship? will we then have to rely on president kovind's good nature, or will there be a clear mechanism by which money power is neutralised in the period immediately after the elections? certainly, it is time for us to recognise that, given modi's continued popularity, only alliances like the one between the congress and the jd(s) will be competitive. declarations of its death notwithstanding, we are still very much in the alliance era. let's hope the ultimate solution to the karnataka question respects that fact.(mihir swarup sharma is a fellow at the observer research foundation.)disclaimer: the opinions expressed within this article are the personal opinions of the author. the facts and opinions appearing in the article do not reflect the views of ndtv and ndtv does not assume any responsibility or liability for the same.",0.11551002961159212,congress defeat karnataka respectable one,"remember bjp mocked congress declaring "" moral victory "" gujarat ?

2018-05-17,10 reasons why bjp improved its karnataka standing," 1. the most important reason is that the bjp solved the problem of its factions and this time it competed with bs yeddyurappa's party back in its fold and the bellary faction (which fought independently last time) also reunited with the mothership. this alone gave the bjp an extra 16.7% of the vote and an extra 65 seats (karnataka has 224).2. the intensive campaign by prime minister narendra modi galvanised the bjp cadre and gave the party a push in the last stages of the battle.3. the hindu-muslim polarisation in the coastal belt. this gave the bjp an extra 15.7% swing in votes in this area and 12 extra seats.4. this religious polarisation also impacted the 24 seats where the percentage of muslim voters is highest (above 25%-50% per seat). these 24 seats are mainly in towns and cities dotted around the state. the voters of the hindus in these seats consolidated and the bjp gained an 18.6% swing in these seats.5. the campaign by yogi adityanath in these areas helped the bjp among hindu voters especially the upper castes.6. the improvement of the vokkaliga support for the janata dal secular or jd(s) and away from the congress reduced the congress vote in the vokkaliga areas of the south. both the jd(s) and the bjp gained from the congress loss of vokkaliga votes.googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display(""adslotnativevideo""); });7. siddaramaiah's decision to call for minority religion status for the lingayats backfired and united the lingayats further which helped the bjp perform strongly in the 62 lingayat seats (it won 37 of them).8. the role of money power and handouts to voters - cash as well as alcohol - hit a new high in these elections. local reports suggest that the amount of money the bjp had was 5 times higher than the congress (though we could not verify this independently).9. the muslim vote shifted away from the jd(s) mainly because of the allegations that the jds has secretly allied with the bjp. in seats where the jd(s) was strong but saw a dent in muslim vote, the bjp won those seats.10. the youth - especially young lingayat voters - are still a strong vote base for modi. the pm's popularity amongst the youth is solid.

2018-05-19,"in karnataka, congress beats modi-shah at their own game"," narendra modi and amit shah have proved that even the best and the most powerful can commit a big blunder: the attempt by them to foist a bjp government upon karnataka.this day will go down in history as the turning point in the present scenario. when it was thought that the modi-shah juggernaut was unstoppable, the opposite happened. now it is a proven fact that they can be stopped, can be defeated. the bjp was the single-largest party but short of majority. the congress and jd(s) combined had the numbers, they should have been allowed to form the government. and now they will.the whole exercise has proved that modi who gained moral stature in 2014 declaring that he was not like the ""corrupt"" congress which would resort to anything to gain power has vanished. goa, manipur and meghalaya were small states: away from blanket coverage on tv, the manipulation there did not register in the mind space of the people, but the entire karnataka drama has been witnessed by the whole country and has exposed modi thoroughly and put him at par with the congress.the country has seen how the governor was ""used"" and how the effort was made to buy mlas. people have heard audio clips in which even yeddyurappa appeared to be luring mlas into crossing over. (the bjp has described these tapes as fake). what this means is that the debate about whether a coalition government of the congress and jd(s) will survive has no meaning. instead, the debate now shifts to how modi can be defeated. he can be outplayed at his own game. an earlier version of this was the bjp defeat in gujarat when it tried to defeat ahmed patel in his re-election to the rajya sabha.karnataka is a repeat of that but on a much larger scale. it proves that modi and shah are not infallible in the art of political management.in my opinion, this is ""the v p singh moment"" for the opposition. the only difference is that then it was the congress which faced the onslaught, now it is the bjp's turn. in 1988, v p singh's election in allahabad gave the sense to the scattered opposition that united they could defeat the congress. in those days, rajiv gandhi's government was supremely powerful. he had more than 400 mps in the lok sabha. it was the impression of the invincibility of the congress which forced two diametrically opposite political formations - the bjp led by advani and the left led by jyoti basu - to fight together and share the same platform to defeat the congress. the congress and jd(s) now know that if they are together in 2019, they will win the majority of the state's parliamentary seats.a few months ago, in gorakhpur, mayawati together with akhilesh yadav came out with similar impact.today, the opposition is realising that if they can come together, modi will not be the pm even if he emerges as the leader of the single largest party. in 1989, the congress led by rajiv gandhi was the single largest party with 192 mps but it could not stake claim as no other party was willing to support it. in karnataka, the congress and jd(s) now know that if they are together in 2019, they will win the majority of the state's parliamentary seats . in fact, the vote share of the congress in karnataka in this election is more than the bjp by 1.50% points and if one combines jd(s) votes, it crosses 50% of the vote share. the message is simple- together, they will sweep. this will be catastrophic for the bjp and modi.googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display(""adslotnativevideo""); });karnataka will remind akhilesh yadav and mayawati that they must stick together to prevent modi from a repeat of 2014 in uttar pradesh where he won 73 of a possible 80 seats and followed that last year by sweeping the state election. when it was thought that the modi-shah juggernaut was unstoppable, the opposite happened.the karnataka election is to be followed by voting in madhya pradesh, chhattisgarh and rajasthan. in mp and chhattisgarh, the bjp has been in power for 15 years. there is strong anti-incumbency against the government. in rajasthan, vasundhara raje is leading an extremely unpopular government. remember these three states are meant to vote just ahead of the national election. the theatre in karnataka has given that psychological edge to congress which it badly needed for the elections in these states.it was rightly propagated earlier that congress does not have the killer instinct which modi and shah have displayed in abundance. after the ahmed patel and karnataka episodes, this criticism stands blunted. they appear to be prepared for every eventuality. since the day of counting in karnataka, congress was a step ahead of bjp. from petitioning the supreme court to bussing their legislators in and out of hyderabad to offering alleged audio evidence of the bjp trying to buy their mlas, the congress has outwitted the bjp. . perhaps it has learnt from its failure in goa, manipur and meghalaya.this ""new"" congress will pose a better challenge to the bjp. modi and shah better rethink the ""pappu"" insults.(ashutosh joined the aam aadmi party in january 2014.)disclaimer: the opinions expressed within this article are the personal opinions of the author. the facts and opinions appearing in the article do not reflect the views of ndtv and ndtv does not assume any responsibility or liability for the same.",0.08141512527876163,"karnataka , congress beats modi-shah game","narendra modi amit shah proved even best powerful commit big blunder : attempt foist bjp government upon karnataka.this day go history turning point present scenario. thought modi-shah juggernaut unstoppable , opposite happened. proven fact stopped , defeated. bjp single-largest party short majority. congress jd( ) combined numbers , allowed form government. will.the whole exercise proved modi gained moral stature 2014 declaring like "" corrupt "" congress would resort anything gain power vanished. goa , manipur meghalaya small states : away blanket coverage tv , manipulation register mind space people , entire karnataka drama witnessed whole country exposed modi thoroughly put par congress.the country seen governor "" used "" effort made buy mlas. people heard audio clips even yeddyurappa appeared luring mlas crossing over.

2018-05-21,what bjp got wrong - allowing congress-jd(s) alliance and more,"the bjp has always said its main aim is to win the 2019 general election, that the karnataka assembly elections are a stepping stone to that larger goal.but the bjp's tactics appear to have been diametrically opposite to their main objective. the result has been to virtually push the congress and jd(s) together.if the congress and jd(s) stay together as allies till the 2019 lok sabha elections, based on their current performance, they would win 21 of the 28 parliamentary seats in karnataka.many analysts who support the bjp have been arguing that once the bjp fell short of a majority, the smarter move would have been to ally with the jd(s). there is of course some doubt about whether the jd(s) would have agreed, given their unhappy alliance in the past, as well as deve gowda claiming that he would disown his son hd kumaraswamy, if he repeated a partnership with the bjp - but had the bjp offered him the chance of becoming chief minister, mr kumaraswamy may well have succumbed.a bjp-jd(s) alliance for the lok sabha would win them all 28 seats. this is because their voter bases complement each other. the bjp base is strong in the north-central lingayat belt and the coastal belt in the west; the jd(s) on the other hand is strong in the southern vokkaliga belt. so it's a perfect electoral match - even if it's not an ideological fit. what's more important? winning elections or ideology?some argue that the story is not over yet. the bjp may still win over some mlas from the congress and the jd(s) - with the right inducements, of course. this could even happen before the trust vote on thursday or in the weeks and months after that - before the lok sabha election. so mr kumaraswamy will have to keep looking over his shoulder.others analysts argue that it's too late. even if the bjp breaks the congress-jd(s) alliance and the government falls, the alliance will now stay intact till the 2019 elections. these analysts could be underestimating the size and power of inducements.whatever happens, in the final analysis, it will be much more difficult for the the bjp to now untangle the knot that the congress and jd(s) have tied - and though not impossible, it'll be much more difficult for the bjp to win most of the karnataka seats in the lok sabha elections. it's a matter now of too little too late.perhaps even more significant is the impact that the karnataka tie-up has quickly had on the viability of a federal front across the country. it has not been an isolated event - in the contrary, there have been major ripple effects with a clear signal to the congress and regional parties - that they must do what happened in karnataka... or die.the bjp will find it very difficult in 2019 to repeat its near clean sweep of the northern and western states in 2014. it has to make up those losses elsewhere. to lose seats in karnataka will make it even more difficult to make up the deficit. so the bottom line of the bjp's determination to go it alone rather than accept it did not have a majority is huge: a congress+jd(s) alliance could win 21 of 28 seats, while a bjp+jd(s) alliance could have won all 28 seats. that works out to a swing of 49 (21+28) -- a swing in seats of this magnitude could even mean make or break 2019.googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display(""adslotnativevideo""); });",0.1824813258636788,bjp got wrong - allowing congress-jd( ) alliance,"bjp always said main aim win 2019 general election , karnataka assembly elections stepping stone larger goal.but bjp ' tactics appear diametrically opposite main objective. result virtually push congress jd( ) together.if congress jd( ) stay together allies till 2019 lok sabha elections , based current performance , would win 21 28 parliamentary seats karnataka.many analysts support bjp arguing bjp fell short majority , smarter move would ally jd( ) . course doubt whether jd( ) would agreed , given unhappy alliance past , well deve gowda claiming would disown son hd kumaraswamy , repeated partnership bjp - bjp offered chance becoming chief minister , mr kumaraswamy may well succumbed.a bjp-jd( ) alliance lok sabha would win 28 seats. voter bases complement other. bjp base strong north-central lingayat belt coastal belt west ; jd( ) hand strong southern vokkaliga belt.

2018-05-21,modi's future seemed secure. then karnataka happened," as a politician, prime minister narendra modi is distinguished by his relentlessness. every vote, every constituency, every election matters. mr modi has built his bharatiya janata party (bjp) into an electoral juggernaut that runs 21 of india's 29 states; 70 percent of india's population is ruled by the bjp at both the state and the federal level.in some of these states, such as the vast northern territory of uttar pradesh, the party swept elections on its own. in others, such as u.p.'s struggling neighbour bihar, the bjp stole away one member of the ruling coalition in order to seize power for itself. in yet others, such as the coastal state of goa, the opposition congress party in fact did better than the bjp in the elections only to discover that pm modi's lieutenants were far more skillful alliance-builders.last weekend, in the southern state of karnataka -- home to india's it capital, bangalore -- mr modi discovered the limits of this strategy. karnataka was the last major state ruled by congress; after a bruising election campaign, the bjp ended up winning more seats in the state assembly, though not quite enough to form an outright majority.that's when things began to go wrong. congress, contrary to expectations, did not roll over and play dead. it swiftly organized a coalition with a smaller regional party to form a majority in the assembly -- and announced that it would claim power for itself.what ensued was both tragic and comic. tragic, because the bjp's subsequent actions showed how easily india's institutions could be subverted with enough effort. comic, because -- well, the attempted subversion was so unabashed that one had to laugh. samajwadi party leader akhilesh yadav with congress president rahul gandhi at a rally in jhansi. (pti)first the governor of the state -- its titular head, appointed by the federal government -- decided the bjp's leader would be sworn in as chief minister, although he didn't have the numbers. this was, most supposed, not unrelated to the fact that the governor was an old party colleague of mr modi's from his home state of gujarat. and once the new bjp chief minister took over, and was given a fortnight to prove he had a majority in the assembly, a game of hide-and-seek played out -- on national television and in deadly earnest.in india, party leaders seeking to insulate their legislators from temptation tend to try and make them disappear, ideally in a nice five-star resort somewhere with only one access road and poor mobile phone reception. this is so predictable that the tourism department of the neighboring state of kerala even tweeted an invitation to non-bjp legislators to the ""safe and beautiful resorts of god's own country."" congress instead chose to sequester its legislators in a bengaluru hotel, while the bjp attempted to convert them using threats and bribes, according to various conversations taped by those on the receiving end. then the new bjp chief minister, within a few hours of being appointed, transferred in a new police chief for the area. he promptly removed the security cordon around the hotel.googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display(""adslotnativevideo""); });the congress and its ally then tried to move its politicians across the border to states that weren't ruled by the bjp, only to discover that the aviation authorities -- controlled by the bjp government in new delhi -- refused permission for the planes they'd chartered to take off. even by the rough-and-tumble standards of indian politics, this was brazen.what was truly significant, though, was the fact that legislators loyal to congress and its allies held firm, in spite of apparent offers to ""increase your wealth 100 times."" in fact, the very openness of such attempts to subvert the constitutional process may have strengthened the legislators' resolve. eventually, mr modi's nominee for the state's chief minister was forced to resign after just 55 hours, to be replaced by the leader of the regional party.a determined and desperate opposition, such as was on display in karnataka, isn't good news for pm modi. the prime minister remains by far the most popular politician in india today and his party is a formidable election-winning machine. it has much more money and is far better organized than its rivals.but, with national elections now less than a year away, the karnataka episode reveals what mr modi should most fear. even in his extraordinary performance in the 2014 elections, in which the bjp was the first party in 30 years to win a parliamentary majority, he took home only 31 percent of the vote. a united and motivated opposition could still defeat him. his position atop india's complicated politics looks quite a bit less secure than it did just a few days ago.disclaimer: the opinions expressed within this article are the personal opinions of the author. the facts and opinions appearing in the article do not reflect the views of ndtv and ndtv does not assume any responsibility or liability for the same.",0.1135083947583948,modi ' future seemed secure. karnataka happened,"politician , prime minister narendra modi distinguished relentlessness. every vote , every constituency , every election matters. mr modi built bharatiya janata party ( bjp ) electoral juggernaut runs 21 india ' 29 states ; 70 percent india ' population ruled bjp state federal level.in states , vast northern territory uttar pradesh , party swept elections own. others , u.p.

2018-05-21,what bjp got wrong - allowing congress-jd(s) alliance and more,"the bjp has always said its main aim is to win the 2019 general election, that the karnataka assembly elections are a stepping stone to that larger goal.but the bjp's tactics appear to have been diametrically opposite to their main objective. the result has been to virtually push the congress and jd(s) together.if the congress and jd(s) stay together as allies till the 2019 lok sabha elections, based on their current performance, they would win 21 of the 28 parliamentary seats in karnataka.many analysts who support the bjp have been arguing that once the bjp fell short of a majority, the smarter move would have been to ally with the jd(s). there is of course some doubt about whether the jd(s) would have agreed, given their unhappy alliance in the past, as well as deve gowda claiming that he would disown his son hd kumaraswamy, if he repeated a partnership with the bjp - but had the bjp offered him the chance of becoming chief minister, mr kumaraswamy may well have succumbed.a bjp-jd(s) alliance for the lok sabha would win them all 28 seats. this is because their voter bases complement each other. the bjp base is strong in the north-central lingayat belt and the coastal belt in the west; the jd(s) on the other hand is strong in the southern vokkaliga belt. so it's a perfect electoral match - even if it's not an ideological fit. what's more important? winning elections or ideology?some argue that the story is not over yet. the bjp may still win over some mlas from the congress and the jd(s) - with the right inducements, of course. this could even happen before the trust vote on thursday or in the weeks and months after that - before the lok sabha election. so mr kumaraswamy will have to keep looking over his shoulder.others analysts argue that it's too late. even if the bjp breaks the congress-jd(s) alliance and the government falls, the alliance will now stay intact till the 2019 elections. these analysts could be underestimating the size and power of inducements.whatever happens, in the final analysis, it will be much more difficult for the the bjp to now untangle the knot that the congress and jd(s) have tied - and though not impossible, it'll be much more difficult for the bjp to win most of the karnataka seats in the lok sabha elections. it's a matter now of too little too late.perhaps even more significant is the impact that the karnataka tie-up has quickly had on the viability of a federal front across the country. it has not been an isolated event - in the contrary, there have been major ripple effects with a clear signal to the congress and regional parties - that they must do what happened in karnataka... or die.the bjp will find it very difficult in 2019 to repeat its near clean sweep of the northern and western states in 2014. it has to make up those losses elsewhere. to lose seats in karnataka will make it even more difficult to make up the deficit. so the bottom line of the bjp's determination to go it alone rather than accept it did not have a majority is huge: a congress+jd(s) alliance could win 21 of 28 seats, while a bjp+jd(s) alliance could have won all 28 seats. that works out to a swing of 49 (21+28) -- a swing in seats of this magnitude could even mean make or break 2019.googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display(""adslotnativevideo""); });",0.1824813258636788,bjp got wrong - allowing congress-jd( ) alliance,"bjp always said main aim win 2019 general election , karnataka assembly elections stepping stone larger goal.but bjp ' tactics appear diametrically opposite main objective. result virtually push congress jd( ) together.if congress jd( ) stay together allies till 2019 lok sabha elections , based current performance , would win 21 28 parliamentary seats karnataka.many analysts support bjp arguing bjp fell short majority , smarter move would ally jd( ) . course doubt whether jd( ) would agreed , given unhappy alliance past , well deve gowda claiming would disown son hd kumaraswamy , repeated partnership bjp - bjp offered chance becoming chief minister , mr kumaraswamy may well succumbed.a bjp-jd( ) alliance lok sabha would win 28 seats. voter bases complement other. bjp base strong north-central lingayat belt coastal belt west ; jd( ) hand strong southern vokkaliga belt.

2018-05-21,opinion: stop making karnataka out to be big blow for bjp," now that the bjp has lost the prestige battle in karnataka, predictably left-liberal cheerleaders are out, all guns blazing, lampooning the party and its top leaders. but on cooler reflection it needs to be asked what wrong did the bjp do, once the results were out? let's assess the facts:1) bjp emerged as the single-largest party in the assembly with a tally of 104 seats compared to 78 of the congress and 37 of jd(s).2) the duly elected leader of its legislature party, bs yeddyurappa, was invited to form the government after he staked claim as the leader of the single -largest party.3) meanwhile, the second and third largest parties in the assembly, namely the congress and janata dal (secular) quickly cobbled together a post-poll alliance and demanded a shot at power. past precedent suggested that the governor could have chosen either option: invite the single-largest party and ask it to prove its majority or ask the second-largest party and/or its associates and offer them the first chance.in the event, as we all know, governor vajubhai vala opted to call the bjp first. there being no pre-determined formula about how a governor is to exercise his legally-conferred ""discretion"", vala cannot be constitutionally faulted for asking yeddyurappa to take oath. where he probably showed bias was in allowing the bjp 15 long days to prove its majority although even that is not unprecedented.the congress swung into action in the supreme court and got the trust vote advanced to two days. faced with certain defeat on the floor of the house, yeddyurappa chose to resign even before the vote was taken, paving the way for the leader of the no. 3 party, hd kumaraswamy, to ascend the chief minister's chair later this week.from the recall of the facts of the drama since may 15 when the results came out, it is clear that the bjp did nothing wrong by staking claim to office or by forming a government. if the governor showed undue favour by giving 15 days for it to prove its majority, the bjp is not to be faulted for the governor's largesse. governors and speakers of legislative bodies have in the past been known to act according to their political predilections resulting in far more serious miscarriages of justice. the bjp is not to be faulted for the governor's largesse, if the governor showed undue favour by giving 15 days for it to prove its majority.in the unsettled 1960s, the then speaker of the west bengal assembly, one bijoy singh nahar simply declared a pro-communist government to be ""illegal"", adjourned the house sine die and walked out, preventing the budget from being tabled! the case of up governor romesh bhandari in the 90s, which resulted in a farcical scenario of two ""chief ministers"" (kalyan singh and jagdambika pal) being seated on either side of the speaker while mlas queued up to vote for one or the other, is relatively recent history.things have changed a lot from those wildly arbitrary days but even now, the scope of a governor's discretion has not been defined. therefore, much as many may be unhappy with governor vala's conduct, he was not wrong on procedure. the supreme court intervened to rectify his bias, but stopped short of reprimanding him.the bjp, therefore, acted in accordance with constitutional propriety and quit office when it failed to gather the required numbers. whether it attempted horse-trading is a matter of conjecture and, in any case, the congress-jd(s) combine too pulled out all stops to hold its mlas captive and even procure some more.googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display(""adslotnativevideo""); });some have argued that a governor is required to take into account the stability factor before inviting one or the other group to form a government if an election throws up a fractured verdict. that may be a desirable criterion, but can it be predicted that a coalition will be stable especially if it has come into being out of exigency and not by premeditated choice? in other words, there was nothing to suggest that a hastily-cobbled alliance between the congress and jd(s) would ensure political stability in karnataka, whereas a bjp-led group would not. no governor can be asked to become a crystal ball-gazer and vouch for stability of any political alliance.it is often said these days ""jo jeeta wohi sikandar,"" but the question in karnataka is ""jeeta kaun?"" (who won?) even if mr kumaraswamy wins his trust vote (which he presumably will), it will not determine the victor of the 2018 polls which did not thrown up a clear mandate for any of the protagonists. jd(s) has cohabited with both the bjp and congress at different points of time. it is perfectly possible that the horses in karnataka may well change mid-stream. in any case, righteous indignation shown by the left-libs in recent days would be entirely unwarranted given the current political morality (or lack of it).undoubtedly, however, the outcome in karnataka will have a major impact on the shape of politics in the run-up to the 2019 lok sabha polls. to begin with, the congress has finally tasted some success (after a string of bitter failures) which augurs well for rahul gandhi who has just taken over the reins of the party. he has also demonstrated that the party can gain by shedding its imperious behavior and must stoop to conquer. this will give confidence to many regional parties that hesitated to join hands with the congress given its past record of high-handedness. the bjp's detractors will try hard to dent the image of party president amit shah's fabled invincibility.as for the bjp, nothing much is lost. it did not have power in karnataka and despite trying hard, failed to get it. this can be temporarily demoralizing for the cadre and its detractors will try hard to dent the image of party president amit shah's fabled invincibility. but crucial assembly polls in bjp-held madhya pradesh, chhattisgarh and rajasthan will soon be upon both the congress and bjp. there is no doubt that prime minister narendra modi and amit shah will reinvigorate the party and lead it to a no-hold-barred battle before the year is out.the efficacy of any anti-bjp alliance will not be tested in the remaining months of 2018. in states where regional parties matter and where their alliance with the congress has the potential to throw up a challenge, their strength won't be tested this year.it is 2019 which will decide india's fate for the coming decade. and from all accounts, narendra modi remains the front-runner.(dr. chandan mitra is a journalist, currently editor of the pioneer group of publications. he is also former bjp mp, rajya sabha.)disclaimer: the opinions expressed within this article are the personal opinions of the author. the facts and opinions appearing in the article do not reflect the views of ndtv and ndtv does not assume any responsibility or liability for the same.",0.0012175324675324651,opinion : stop making karnataka big blow bjp,"bjp lost prestige battle karnataka , predictably left-liberal cheerleaders , guns blazing , lampooning party top leaders. cooler reflection needs asked wrong bjp , results ?

2018-05-21,opinion: stop making karnataka out to be big blow for bjp," now that the bjp has lost the prestige battle in karnataka, predictably left-liberal cheerleaders are out, all guns blazing, lampooning the party and its top leaders. but on cooler reflection it needs to be asked what wrong did the bjp do, once the results were out? let's assess the facts:1) bjp emerged as the single-largest party in the assembly with a tally of 104 seats compared to 78 of the congress and 37 of jd(s).2) the duly elected leader of its legislature party, bs yeddyurappa, was invited to form the government after he staked claim as the leader of the single -largest party.3) meanwhile, the second and third largest parties in the assembly, namely the congress and janata dal (secular) quickly cobbled together a post-poll alliance and demanded a shot at power. past precedent suggested that the governor could have chosen either option: invite the single-largest party and ask it to prove its majority or ask the second-largest party and/or its associates and offer them the first chance.in the event, as we all know, governor vajubhai vala opted to call the bjp first. there being no pre-determined formula about how a governor is to exercise his legally-conferred ""discretion"", vala cannot be constitutionally faulted for asking yeddyurappa to take oath. where he probably showed bias was in allowing the bjp 15 long days to prove its majority although even that is not unprecedented.the congress swung into action in the supreme court and got the trust vote advanced to two days. faced with certain defeat on the floor of the house, yeddyurappa chose to resign even before the vote was taken, paving the way for the leader of the no. 3 party, hd kumaraswamy, to ascend the chief minister's chair later this week.from the recall of the facts of the drama since may 15 when the results came out, it is clear that the bjp did nothing wrong by staking claim to office or by forming a government. if the governor showed undue favour by giving 15 days for it to prove its majority, the bjp is not to be faulted for the governor's largesse. governors and speakers of legislative bodies have in the past been known to act according to their political predilections resulting in far more serious miscarriages of justice. the bjp is not to be faulted for the governor's largesse, if the governor showed undue favour by giving 15 days for it to prove its majority.in the unsettled 1960s, the then speaker of the west bengal assembly, one bijoy singh nahar simply declared a pro-communist government to be ""illegal"", adjourned the house sine die and walked out, preventing the budget from being tabled! the case of up governor romesh bhandari in the 90s, which resulted in a farcical scenario of two ""chief ministers"" (kalyan singh and jagdambika pal) being seated on either side of the speaker while mlas queued up to vote for one or the other, is relatively recent history.things have changed a lot from those wildly arbitrary days but even now, the scope of a governor's discretion has not been defined. therefore, much as many may be unhappy with governor vala's conduct, he was not wrong on procedure. the supreme court intervened to rectify his bias, but stopped short of reprimanding him.the bjp, therefore, acted in accordance with constitutional propriety and quit office when it failed to gather the required numbers. whether it attempted horse-trading is a matter of conjecture and, in any case, the congress-jd(s) combine too pulled out all stops to hold its mlas captive and even procure some more.googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display(""adslotnativevideo""); });some have argued that a governor is required to take into account the stability factor before inviting one or the other group to form a government if an election throws up a fractured verdict. that may be a desirable criterion, but can it be predicted that a coalition will be stable especially if it has come into being out of exigency and not by premeditated choice? in other words, there was nothing to suggest that a hastily-cobbled alliance between the congress and jd(s) would ensure political stability in karnataka, whereas a bjp-led group would not. no governor can be asked to become a crystal ball-gazer and vouch for stability of any political alliance.it is often said these days ""jo jeeta wohi sikandar,"" but the question in karnataka is ""jeeta kaun?"" (who won?) even if mr kumaraswamy wins his trust vote (which he presumably will), it will not determine the victor of the 2018 polls which did not thrown up a clear mandate for any of the protagonists. jd(s) has cohabited with both the bjp and congress at different points of time. it is perfectly possible that the horses in karnataka may well change mid-stream. in any case, righteous indignation shown by the left-libs in recent days would be entirely unwarranted given the current political morality (or lack of it).undoubtedly, however, the outcome in karnataka will have a major impact on the shape of politics in the run-up to the 2019 lok sabha polls. to begin with, the congress has finally tasted some success (after a string of bitter failures) which augurs well for rahul gandhi who has just taken over the reins of the party. he has also demonstrated that the party can gain by shedding its imperious behavior and must stoop to conquer. this will give confidence to many regional parties that hesitated to join hands with the congress given its past record of high-handedness. the bjp's detractors will try hard to dent the image of party president amit shah's fabled invincibility.as for the bjp, nothing much is lost. it did not have power in karnataka and despite trying hard, failed to get it. this can be temporarily demoralizing for the cadre and its detractors will try hard to dent the image of party president amit shah's fabled invincibility. but crucial assembly polls in bjp-held madhya pradesh, chhattisgarh and rajasthan will soon be upon both the congress and bjp. there is no doubt that prime minister narendra modi and amit shah will reinvigorate the party and lead it to a no-hold-barred battle before the year is out.the efficacy of any anti-bjp alliance will not be tested in the remaining months of 2018. in states where regional parties matter and where their alliance with the congress has the potential to throw up a challenge, their strength won't be tested this year.it is 2019 which will decide india's fate for the coming decade. and from all accounts, narendra modi remains the front-runner.(dr. chandan mitra is a journalist, currently editor of the pioneer group of publications. he is also former bjp mp, rajya sabha.)disclaimer: the opinions expressed within this article are the personal opinions of the author. the facts and opinions appearing in the article do not reflect the views of ndtv and ndtv does not assume any responsibility or liability for the same.",0.0012175324675324651,opinion : stop making karnataka big blow bjp,"bjp lost prestige battle karnataka , predictably left-liberal cheerleaders , guns blazing , lampooning party top leaders. cooler reflection needs asked wrong bjp , results ?

2018-05-23,opinion: whatsapp messages show opposition unity being taken seriously," the opposition has just shown a semblance of unity at the swearing in ceremony of h d kumaraswamy. it has miles to go before it crystallises into some kind of a formal structure. but hindutva supporters are already jittery. their reaction on social media is unprintable. they are bitter, angry and resorting to all kinds of abuses. this shows how ugly the battle of 2019 is going to be. i saw a trailer of this in the morning when a whatsapp message popped up in my phone inbox. it carried a picture of seven opposition leaders - mayawati, arvind, akhilesh, mamata, owaisi, lalu yadav and stalin - like seven vertical boxes in a tv frame with their parties name written under each vertical. in bold letters there was a sub heading - bastard - b for bsp, a for aap, s for sp, t for tmc, a for aimim, r for rjd and d for dmk - meaning that the opposition is ""bastard"". this underlines two things - firstly, the ruling establishment has taken serious note of talks of opposition unity and it is a little nervous. secondly, it is already working on a strategy to discredit opposition unity.there is no denying the fact the karnataka has given a new lease of life to a splintered opposition. had the bjp emerged as a party with a clear majority, the opposition would have been a demoralised lot. but the governor inviting bjp leader bs yeddyurappa and his failing to form the government have come as a boon in disguise. it has given them the hope that the bjp and modi can be defeated, provided they are united. it has also given a reason to opposition leaders to think that the congress can be flexible and is ready to leave behind its big brother attitude. this is big as the entire episode has given the impression that smaller parties do business with the congress too. earlier there was an impression in the opposition camp that rahul gandhi unlike his mother is rigid, it is difficult to have an understanding with him, he is too bookish. the congress offering the chief minister seat to jd(s) has broken that myth, the erstwhile vice president of the congress has made successfully transitioned into a practical politician. there is no denying the fact the karnataka has given a new lease of life to a splintered oppositionsecondly, karnataka has also proved that the congress is willing to fight, and fight with a killer instinct. earlier it was said that the congress had neither the will nor had capacity to match modi and amit shah's guile. despite emerging as the bigger party, it let go of the advantage in goa, manipur and meghalaya. but since the gujarat election, glimpses of the old congress which could be machiavellian while dealing with the political realities of the time have been on display. in the karnataka crisis, the congress was always ahead of the bjp. modi and amit shah had no clue on how to counter their moves. amit shah later admitted that if the congress had not kept its mlas in five-star hotels, the bjp would have proved its majority on the floor of the house. this signifies that the congress is willing to play the lead role with the same killer instinct that modi and amit shah are known for. once the congress has established its pole position, it is easier for opposition leaders to work and strategise as a team. i still remember nitish kumar accusing rahul of not leading and setting the agenda for the anti-modi camp. now all those misgivings and doubts should disappear into thin air.now the biggest issue is what should be the formal structure of this unity. should it be like the national front of 1989 when the opposition was divided into three ideological camps: socialist and ex-congress leaders in one group, the bjp in another and communists in the third group. first, all the socialists and ex-congressmen merged into janta dal and then they allied with other smaller parties like national conference and telugu desam to form the national front which was finally supported by the bjp and the left. this four-tier unity was replaced by a three-tier unity in 1996 when the united front came into existence and formed the government. the bjp was out of this combination. if 1989 was a pre-poll understanding, then 1996 was a post-poll adjustment.but 2018 should be vastly different. firstly, this will purely be an anti-rss unity with no understanding with hindutva groups. secondly, in the present political scenario, this has to be a long-term alliance as the threat of fascism and dictatorship is a reality and if it has to be fought, then what's needed is ideological cohesion, a robust structural mechanism and a common minimum programme. let's not get confused. the modi government is a rss government and is pursuing an rss agenda. let us not live under the illusion that if modi were to be replaced by any other leader from his party, things would be different. vajpayee let the gujarat riots happen and did not do a thing for a month. christian missionaries were attacked brutally during his time. since vajpayee's was a coalition government, it had limitations. today, the modi government is a majority government. so the dance of hatred is in full swing.this will get uglier and uglier as the 2019 elections approach because today modi is on a weak wicket. he does not carry the same image as he did in 2014. he was then an untested brand in national politics. people had had only glimpses of his gujarat model but people believed that was a trailer and the film would be a super-hit. unfortunately, the film is a huge disappointment. therefore, now killing the opponent's image will be the only agenda. since this front will have real potential to dislodge modi, a lot of dirty tricks will be used to discredit the opposition and all kinds of media platforms will be used.googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display(""adslotnativevideo""); });modi would also like to play the victim card. he is a master craftsman in polarising society and generating sympathy for himself. when he was confronted with severe criticism across the country after the 2002 gujarat riots, he smartly played the hindu victim card that he had done no wrong and yet the whole world was after him. this strategy helped him consolidate hindu votes. this helped him win three consecutive elections.modi with the help of his media friends has been trying to project that he is honestly trying to change the society for the better and make india great but the opposition is busy laying impediments in his path. and therefore the opposition has to be doubly careful in choosing the issues and defining the nature of the opposition unity. the creation of a national platform as of now should be avoided; regional structuring and national understanding should be the mantra for opposition unity.(ashutosh joined the aam aadmi party in january 2014.)​disclaimer: the opinions expressed within this article are the personal opinions

2018-05-23,opinion: whatsapp messages show opposition unity being taken seriously," the opposition has just shown a semblance of unity at the swearing in ceremony of h d kumaraswamy. it has miles to go before it crystallises into some kind of a formal structure. but hindutva supporters are already jittery. their reaction on social media is unprintable. they are bitter, angry and resorting to all kinds of abuses. this shows how ugly the battle of 2019 is going to be. i saw a trailer of this in the morning when a whatsapp message popped up in my phone inbox. it carried a picture of seven opposition leaders - mayawati, arvind, akhilesh, mamata, owaisi, lalu yadav and stalin - like seven vertical boxes in a tv frame with their parties name written under each vertical. in bold letters there was a sub heading - bastard - b for bsp, a for aap, s for sp, t for tmc, a for aimim, r for rjd and d for dmk - meaning that the opposition is ""bastard"". this underlines two things - firstly, the ruling establishment has taken serious note of talks of opposition unity and it is a little nervous. secondly, it is already working on a strategy to discredit opposition unity.there is no denying the fact the karnataka has given a new lease of life to a splintered opposition. had the bjp emerged as a party with a clear majority, the opposition would have been a demoralised lot. but the governor inviting bjp leader bs yeddyurappa and his failing to form the government have come as a boon in disguise. it has given them the hope that the bjp and modi can be defeated, provided they are united. it has also given a reason to opposition leaders to think that the congress can be flexible and is ready to leave behind its big brother attitude. this is big as the entire episode has given the impression that smaller parties do business with the congress too. earlier there was an impression in the opposition camp that rahul gandhi unlike his mother is rigid, it is difficult to have an understanding with him, he is too bookish. the congress offering the chief minister seat to jd(s) has broken that myth, the erstwhile vice president of the congress has made successfully transitioned into a practical politician. there is no denying the fact the karnataka has given a new lease of life to a splintered oppositionsecondly, karnataka has also proved that the congress is willing to fight, and fight with a killer instinct. earlier it was said that the congress had neither the will nor had capacity to match modi and amit shah's guile. despite emerging as the bigger party, it let go of the advantage in goa, manipur and meghalaya. but since the gujarat election, glimpses of the old congress which could be machiavellian while dealing with the political realities of the time have been on display. in the karnataka crisis, the congress was always ahead of the bjp. modi and amit shah had no clue on how to counter their moves. amit shah later admitted that if the congress had not kept its mlas in five-star hotels, the bjp would have proved its majority on the floor of the house. this signifies that the congress is willing to play the lead role with the same killer instinct that modi and amit shah are known for. once the congress has established its pole position, it is easier for opposition leaders to work and strategise as a team. i still remember nitish kumar accusing rahul of not leading and setting the agenda for the anti-modi camp. now all those misgivings and doubts should disappear into thin air.now the biggest issue is what should be the formal structure of this unity. should it be like the national front of 1989 when the opposition was divided into three ideological camps: socialist and ex-congress leaders in one group, the bjp in another and communists in the third group. first, all the socialists and ex-congressmen merged into janta dal and then they allied with other smaller parties like national conference and telugu desam to form the national front which was finally supported by the bjp and the left. this four-tier unity was replaced by a three-tier unity in 1996 when the united front came into existence and formed the government. the bjp was out of this combination. if 1989 was a pre-poll understanding, then 1996 was a post-poll adjustment.but 2018 should be vastly different. firstly, this will purely be an anti-rss unity with no understanding with hindutva groups. secondly, in the present political scenario, this has to be a long-term alliance as the threat of fascism and dictatorship is a reality and if it has to be fought, then what's needed is ideological cohesion, a robust structural mechanism and a common minimum programme. let's not get confused. the modi government is a rss government and is pursuing an rss agenda. let us not live under the illusion that if modi were to be replaced by any other leader from his party, things would be different. vajpayee let the gujarat riots happen and did not do a thing for a month. christian missionaries were attacked brutally during his time. since vajpayee's was a coalition government, it had limitations. today, the modi government is a majority government. so the dance of hatred is in full swing.this will get uglier and uglier as the 2019 elections approach because today modi is on a weak wicket. he does not carry the same image as he did in 2014. he was then an untested brand in national politics. people had had only glimpses of his gujarat model but people believed that was a trailer and the film would be a super-hit. unfortunately, the film is a huge disappointment. therefore, now killing the opponent's image will be the only agenda. since this front will have real potential to dislodge modi, a lot of dirty tricks will be used to discredit the opposition and all kinds of media platforms will be used.googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display(""adslotnativevideo""); });modi would also like to play the victim card. he is a master craftsman in polarising society and generating sympathy for himself. when he was confronted with severe criticism across the country after the 2002 gujarat riots, he smartly played the hindu victim card that he had done no wrong and yet the whole world was after him. this strategy helped him consolidate hindu votes. this helped him win three consecutive elections.modi with the help of his media friends has been trying to project that he is honestly trying to change the society for the better and make india great but the opposition is busy laying impediments in his path. and therefore the opposition has to be doubly careful in choosing the issues and defining the nature of the opposition unity. the creation of a national platform as of now should be avoided; regional structuring and national understanding should be the mantra for opposition unity.(ashutosh joined the aam aadmi party in january 2014.)​disclaimer: the opinions expressed within this article are the personal opinions

2018-05-23,india's budget threat in focus after pm modi loses karnataka,"new delhi: prime minister narendra modi's loss of control of a key state will put pressure on his party to ramp up spending to woo more rural voters, pushing back plans to rein in one of asia's largest budget deficits.the budget was already under strain even before his weekend's events in karnataka -- the state where pm modi's bjp failed to form a government. the fiscal target was breached in the 2018 financial year, while the goal for this year was widened to 3.3 percent of gross domestic product.add to that a surge in oil prices, a more than 6 percent slump in the rupee against the dollar this year, and a pick-up in inflation, and india's outlook is starting to look gloomy.""the karnataka election is an additional source of uncertainty,"" said suvodeep rakshit, senior economist at kotak institutional equities in mumbai. while there's usually a risk of fiscal slippage in the year before elections, the rise in oil prices is worsening the picture, he said, forecasting a budget gap of 3.5 percent of gdp this year.bonds have taken a knock this year, fueled by wider budget targets, faster inflation and a global selloff of emerging market assets. yields on the 10-year bond have climbed almost 50 basis points since the beginning of the year. pm narendra modi's party, the bjp, lost control of karmataka last week (pti photo)pranjul bhandari, chief india economist at hsbc holdings plc, said election pressures may prompt the government to cut excise duties rather than raise pump prices, pushing up the deficit. she estimates that for every $10 per barrel rise in global oil prices, the fiscal gap would increase by around 0.3 percent of gdp.election battleindia's rural areas are home to about 68 percent of the nation's 1.3 billion people, and form a key voting bloc in the world's largest democracy. pm modi has promised to increase the living standards of villagers and double farmers' income by 2022.in the past six months, the bjp has faced stiff competition from the opposition congress party in pm modi's home state of gujarat and in by-elections in bihar, rajasthan and uttar pradesh. while the bjp won more votes in karnataka than in the last election, it fell short of an overall majority.googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display(""adslotnativevideo""); });the congress, which is set to form a government in karnataka with a regional party, is likely to announce programs to appease farmers. more and more states are already offering to write off farm loans.""the stance of the central and various state governments will turn more pro-rural and possible freebies will mean macro will remain under pressure,"" analysts at clsa india private ltd. led by mahesh nandurkar wrote in a note.

_pricee.push({container : '_pcwgtmid'}); barely a week after the show-stealing hug between mayawati and sonia gandhi, the newly-born all-for-one spirit of the opposition will be tested in uttar pradesh, the state which decides who forms the national government.the embrace in karnataka, offered as nearly 23 top opposition leaders took the stage to proclaim a giant effort to block prime minister narendra modi's re-election, has already seen some follow up in kairana in western up, which votes for its new member of parliament on monday; the results will be declared three days later.on thursday, one of two opposition candidates opted out of the by-election. that means it's a direct contest now between mriganka singh of the bjp, whose father hukum singh was the mp till he died in february, and tabassum hassan who belongs to the rashtriya lok dal or rld, the regional party headed by ajit singh, but is being backed by the congress and the two other main players in the state, mayawati's bahujan samaj party or bsp and akhilesh yadav's samajwadi party.in many ways, it is their new comity that's being tested. in march, they drew a line under decades of rivalry to collaborate on a crucial election - for gorakhpur, represented for nearly 20 years by yogi adityanath, the saffron-robe-wearing monk who became chief minister of uttar pradesh. together, they easily wrested the bjp stronghold, proving that they could control india's most important political arena if they remained on the same side.the bjp would have won nearly 50 fewer seats in the last general election if they had combined, according to their joint vote share in the 2017 election. mriganka singh of the bjp hopes to ride the sympathy wave even though the numbers are stacked against her kairana also provides other opposition parties with a crucial chance to case the joint ahead of 2019. if the gorakhpur magic repeats, they will be incentivized to stick together; if not, the newly-achieved papering over of differences will quickly crumple.for rld president ajit singh and his son and vice-president of the party, jayant chowdhury, the kairana election presents the opportunity to reclaim their core supporters of jats, the dominant agrarian caste of western up, which shifted loyalties to the bjp in the general election after hindu-muslim violence tore through areas of muzaffarnagar and shamli districts in 2013.kairana parliamentary constituency which has a population of 16 lakhs and is located in shamli district was one of the areas worst hit by the violence. by choosing a muslim candidate, the rld - and by extension, the opposition - is hoping to unite its jat base with muslim voters, who form about nearly half the population in kairana.at least 60 people, mainly muslims, were killed in the 2013 western up riots and more than 50,000 were displaced from their homes. hindu votes consolidated around the bjp as prime minister narendra modi wowed india in a campaign that gave him a succulent victory. jats moved away from the rld and did not return in the state election last year that saw yogi adityanath take over as head of uttar pradesh.when hukum singh of the bjp won kairana, his victory margin in 2014 of 2.30 lakh votes was more than the combined votes of the sp, bsp and rld. rld candidate tabassum hassan had earlier won from kairana in 2009 on a bsp ticket by defeating hukum singh. this time, she takes on his daughterwhile campaigning for the state election last year, he alleged that nearly 350 hindu families had fled the muslim-dominated towns of kairana and kandhla due to ""threats and extortion by criminal elements belonging to a particular community and lack of security."" investigations revealed that some of the people on his list were dead, or had left their homes for other reasons, many of them several years before the 2013 riots. later, hukum singh also backtracked saying there was no communal angle to the migration. but the bjp was able to make the alleged exodus of hindus into a politically emotive issue and it won four of the five assembly seats that together make up the kairana lok sabha constituency.the loss, however, had a sliver of hope for the opposition.googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display(""adslotnativevideo""); });in 2014, hukum singh had managed a whopping 50.54 per cent of the votes; in 2017, his party's share fell by 24%. and his daughter, mriganka singh, was defeated by nahid hassan. next week's election is between his mother, tabassum, and mriganka singh.""it was a section of the 1.5 lakh hindu jat vote which moved away from the bjp (in last year's state election),"" claims yashpal mallik, president of a local jat organization who says the community is now upset with the bjp for failing to include it in groups that benefit from affirmative action policies. ""for a while, the jats believed in narendra modi's promise of creating employment outside of agriculture and government through programmes like 'make in india', but where are the jobs after four years? young jats have no choice but to demand reservation or live off the land, where the distress is growing, because the bjp has reneged on its assurances to sugarcane farmers."" ajit singh is confident of re-building the rashtriya lok dal's jat-muslim vote bank ahead of the 2019 polls.kairana has six sugar mills which together have purchased sugarcane worth nearly 1,200 crores from farmers since october last year. but instead of paying them within the stipulated time of 14 days, the mills, almost eight months later, still haven't paid half the bill.""and this is the situation when the minister for sugarcane development, suresh rana, is one of the mlas from the kairana parliamentary constituency,"" jayant chowdhury points out to a gathering of farmers. ""we would have ensured timely payment to every cultivator, but you did not elect a single mp or mla from the rld. you were persuaded to think of yourselves, not as farmers, but as hindus. and look where it got you?""he is campaigning in phugana, a large and prosperous village dominated by jats where 16 muslim men were killed in 2013 and six women allegedly gangraped. phugana's jats have voted for the bjp in the two elections since then, but this time, balbir mallik, a prominent landlord, insists ""our community will vote for the rld candidate (tabassum hassan) in spite of her religion, because this time we are supporting ajit singh. every caste in up has its own party now, whether it's the yadavs, rajbhars or kurmis. we had one for more than two decades, but drifted away from it, now it is the time for ghar-wapsi (home-coming).""in the nearby village of lisad, where 13 muslims were killed in 2013, rajinder chowdhury, a local jat leader, is accused in 36 cases of arson and murder. in february, yogi adityanath's government began the process of withdrawing the firs or police cases filed against some of the hindu jats. ""but nothing has happened so far,"" said mr chowdhury because the cases against him remain open. farmers in up's sugarcane belt have accused the yogi government of failing them.by having mayawati on its side - though her support is implicit rather than explicit - the opposition also hopes to win kairana's 2.5 lakh dalits who in 2014 also voted for the bjp.""we got carried away by the bjps 'bahu beti bachao' - 'save our daughters and daughters-in-law rhetoric' in the build-up to the muzaffarnagar-shamli riots, but soon realised that our own bahu-betis were repeatedly teased and raped, but no one talked about protecting their honour,"" says sachin, a college student and member of the bhim army, an organization of young dalits formed in 2015 after attacks on dalits by upper castes in saharanpur, also in western up.mriganka singh, however, is confident of victory. apart from the bjp's traditional upper caste hindu vote, she also has the loyalty of members of her own caste, kairana's 1.4 lakh hindu gujjars. she refutes the charge that yogi adityanath's administration, accused of extra-judicial encounters, has targeted minorities including muslims. ""law and order has improved,"" she says, cheered on by her supporters.the biggest push for mriganka singh, however, could come from pm modi himself who isn't campaigning for her but is inaugurating a major freeway and holding a public meeting next door in baghpat the day before voting. the opposition has said this amounts to indirectly violating the prohibition on campaigning in the hours before voting.like with other by-elections in uttar pradesh, kairana is a political notable. and will serve as a crash course on 2019.",0.0854365447477692,"mayawati ' big hug moment , test opposition jhappi","kairana , uttar pradesh : highlightsnewly-born spirit opposition tested uttar pradesh kairana also provides opposition parties crucial chance like bypolls uttar pradesh , kairana political notablewindow._pricee = window._pricee &#124; &#124; [ ] ; _pricee.push( { container : ' _pcwgtmid ' } ) ; barely week show-stealing hug mayawati sonia gandhi , newly-born all-for-one spirit opposition tested uttar pradesh , state decides forms national government.the embrace karnataka , offered nearly 23 top opposition leaders took stage proclaim giant effort block prime minister narendra modi ' re-election , already seen follow kairana western , votes new member parliament monday ; results declared three days later.on thursday , one two opposition candidates opted by-election. means ' direct contest mriganka singh bjp , whose father hukum singh mp till died february , tabassum hassan belongs rashtriya lok dal rld , regional party headed ajit singh , backed congress two main players state , mayawati ' bahujan samaj party bsp akhilesh yadav ' samajwadi party.in many ways , new comity ' tested. march , drew line decades rivalry collaborate crucial election - gorakhpur , represented nearly 20 years yogi adityanath , saffron-robe-wearing monk became chief minister uttar pradesh. together , easily wrested bjp stronghold , proving could control india ' important political arena remained side.the bjp would nearly 50 fewer seats last general election combined , according joint vote share 2017 election. mriganka singh bjp hopes ride sympathy wave even though numbers stacked kairana also provides opposition parties crucial chance case joint ahead 2019. gorakhpur magic repeats , incentivized stick together ; , newly-achieved papering differences quickly crumple.for rld president ajit singh son vice-president party , jayant chowdhury , kairana election presents opportunity reclaim core supporters jats , dominant agrarian caste western , shifted loyalties bjp general election hindu-muslim violence tore areas muzaffarnagar shamli districts 2013.kairana parliamentary constituency population 16 lakhs located shamli district one areas worst hit violence. choosing muslim candidate , rld - extension , opposition - hoping unite jat base muslim voters , form nearly half population kairana.at least 60 people , mainly muslims , killed 2013 western riots 50,000 displaced homes. hindu votes consolidated around bjp prime minister narendra modi wowed india campaign gave succulent victory. jats moved away rld return state election last year saw yogi adityanath take head uttar pradesh.when hukum singh bjp kairana , victory margin 2014 2.30 lakh votes combined votes sp , bsp rld. rld candidate tabassum hassan earlier kairana 2009 bsp ticket defeating hukum singh. time , takes daughterwhile campaigning state election last year , alleged nearly 350 hindu families fled muslim-dominated towns kairana kandhla due "" threats extortion criminal elements belonging particular community lack security.

the results will be declared three days later.on thursday, one of two opposition candidates opted out of the by-election. that means it's a direct contest now between mriganka singh of the bjp, whose father hukum singh was the mp till he died in february, and tabassum hassan who belongs to the rashtriya lok dal or rld, the regional party headed by ajit singh, but is being backed by the congress and the two other main players in the state, mayawati's bahujan samaj party or bsp and akhilesh yadav's samajwadi party.in many ways, it is their new comity that's being tested. in march, they drew a line under decades of rivalry to collaborate on a crucial election - for gorakhpur, represented for nearly 20 years by yogi adityanath, the saffron-robe-wearing monk who became chief minister of uttar pradesh. together, they easily wrested the bjp stronghold, proving that they could control india's most important political arena if they remained on the same side.the bjp would have won nearly 50 fewer seats in the last general election if they had combined, according to their joint vote share in the 2017 election. mriganka singh of the bjp hopes to ride the sympathy wave even though the numbers are stacked against her kairana also provides other opposition parties with a crucial chance to case the joint ahead of 2019. if the gorakhpur magic repeats, they will be incentivized to stick together; if not, the newly-achieved papering over of differences will quickly crumple.for rld president ajit singh and his son and vice-president of the party, jayant chowdhury, the kairana election presents the opportunity to reclaim their core supporters of jats, the dominant agrarian caste of western up, which shifted loyalties to the bjp in the general election after hindu-muslim violence tore through areas of muzaffarnagar and shamli districts in 2013.kairana parliamentary constituency which has a population of 16 lakhs and is located in shamli district was one of the areas worst hit by the violence. by choosing a muslim candidate, the rld - and by extension, the opposition - is hoping to unite its jat base with muslim voters, who form about nearly half the population in kairana.at least 60 people, mainly muslims, were killed in the 2013 western up riots and more than 50,000 were displaced from their homes. hindu votes consolidated around the bjp as prime minister narendra modi wowed india in a campaign that gave him a succulent victory. jats moved away from the rld and did not return in the state election last year that saw yogi adityanath take over as head of uttar pradesh.when hukum singh of the bjp won kairana, his victory margin in 2014 of 2.30 lakh votes was more than the combined votes of the sp, bsp and rld. rld candidate tabassum hassan had earlier won from kairana in 2009 on a bsp ticket by defeating hukum singh. this time, she takes on his daughterwhile campaigning for the state election last year, he alleged that nearly 350 hindu families had fled the muslim-dominated towns of kairana and kandhla due to ""threats and extortion by criminal elements belonging to a particular community and lack of security."" investigations revealed that some of the people on his list were dead, or had left their homes for other reasons, many of them several years before the 2013 riots. later, hukum singh also backtracked saying there was no communal angle to the migration. but the bjp was able to make the alleged exodus of hindus into a politically emotive issue and it won four of the five assembly seats that together make up the kairana lok sabha constituency.the loss, however, had a sliver of hope for the opposition.googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display(""adslotnativevideo""); });in 2014, hukum singh had managed a whopping 50.54 per cent of the votes; in 2017, his party's share fell by 24%. and his daughter, mriganka singh, was defeated by nahid hassan. next week's election is between his mother, tabassum, and mriganka singh.""it was a section of the 1.5 lakh hindu jat vote which moved away from the bjp (in last year's state election),"" claims yashpal mallik, president of a local jat organization who says the community is now upset with the bjp for failing to include it in groups that benefit from affirmative action policies. ""for a while, the jats believed in narendra modi's promise of creating employment outside of agriculture and government through programmes like 'make in india', but where are the jobs after four years? young jats have no choice but to demand reservation or live off the land, where the distress is growing, because the bjp has reneged on its assurances to sugarcane farmers."" ajit singh is confident of re-building the rashtriya lok dal's jat-muslim vote bank ahead of the 2019 polls.kairana has six sugar mills which together have purchased sugarcane worth nearly 1,200 crores from farmers since october last year. but instead of paying them within the stipulated time of 14 days, the mills, almost eight months later, still haven't paid half the bill.""and this is the situation when the minister for sugarcane development, suresh rana, is one of the mlas from the kairana parliamentary constituency,"" jayant chowdhury points out to a gathering of farmers. ""we would have ensured timely payment to every cultivator, but you did not elect a single mp or mla from the rld. you were persuaded to think of yourselves, not as farmers, but as hindus. and look where it got you?""he is campaigning in phugana, a large and prosperous village dominated by jats where 16 muslim men were killed in 2013 and six women allegedly gangraped. phugana's jats have voted for the bjp in the two elections since then, but this time, balbir mallik, a prominent landlord, insists ""our community will vote for the rld candidate (tabassum hassan) in spite of her religion, because this time we are supporting ajit singh. every caste in up has its own party now, whether it's the yadavs, rajbhars or kurmis. we had one for more than two decades, but drifted away from it, now it is the time for ghar-wapsi (home-coming).""in the nearby village of lisad, where 13 muslims were killed in 2013, rajinder chowdhury, a local jat leader, is accused in 36 cases of arson and murder. in february, yogi adityanath's government began the process of withdrawing the firs or police cases filed against some of the hindu jats. ""but nothing has happened so far,"" said mr chowdhury because the cases against him remain open. farmers in up's sugarcane belt have accused the yogi government of failing them.by having mayawati on its side - though her support is implicit rather than explicit - the opposition also hopes to win kairana's 2.5 lakh dalits who in 2014 also voted for the bjp.""we got carried away by the bjps 'bahu beti bachao' - 'save our daughters and daughters-in-law rhetoric' in the build-up to the muzaffarnagar-shamli riots, but soon realised that our own bahu-betis were repeatedly teased and raped, but no one talked about protecting their honour,"" says sachin, a college student and member of the bhim army, an organization of young dalits formed in 2015 after attacks on dalits by upper castes in saharanpur, also in western up.mriganka singh, however, is confident of victory. apart from the bjp's traditional upper caste hindu vote, she also has the loyalty of members of her own caste, kairana's 1.4 lakh hindu gujjars. she refutes the charge that yogi adityanath's administration, accused of extra-judicial encounters, has targeted minorities including muslims. ""law and order has improved,"" she says, cheered on by her supporters.the biggest push for mriganka singh, however, could come from pm modi himself who isn't campaigning for her but is inaugurating a major freeway and holding a public meeting next door in baghpat the day before voting. the opposition has said this amounts to indirectly violating the prohibition on campaigning in the hours before voting.like with other by-elections in uttar pradesh, kairana is a political notable. and will serve as a crash course on 2019.",0.0854365447477692,"mayawati ' big hug moment , test opposition jhappi","kairana , uttar pradesh : highlightsnewly-born spirit opposition tested uttar pradesh kairana also provides opposition parties crucial chance like bypolls uttar pradesh , kairana political notablewindow._pricee = window._pricee &#124; &#124; [ ] ; _pricee.push( { container : ' _pcwgtmid ' } ) ; barely week show-stealing hug mayawati sonia gandhi , newly-born all-for-one spirit opposition tested uttar pradesh , state decides forms national government.the embrace karnataka , offered nearly 23 top opposition leaders took stage proclaim giant effort block prime minister narendra modi ' re-election , already seen follow kairana western , votes new member parliament monday ; results declared three days later.on thursday , one two opposition candidates opted by-election. means ' direct contest mriganka singh bjp , whose father hukum singh mp till died february , tabassum hassan belongs rashtriya lok dal rld , regional party headed ajit singh , backed congress two main players state , mayawati ' bahujan samaj party bsp akhilesh yadav ' samajwadi party.in many ways , new comity ' tested. march , drew line decades rivalry collaborate crucial election - gorakhpur , represented nearly 20 years yogi adityanath , saffron-robe-wearing monk became chief minister uttar pradesh. together , easily wrested bjp stronghold , proving could control india ' important political arena remained side.the bjp would nearly 50 fewer seats last general election combined , according joint vote share 2017 election. mriganka singh bjp hopes ride sympathy wave even though numbers stacked kairana also provides opposition parties crucial chance case joint ahead 2019. gorakhpur magic repeats , incentivized stick together ; , newly-achieved papering differences quickly crumple.for rld president ajit singh son vice-president party , jayant chowdhury , kairana election presents opportunity reclaim core supporters jats , dominant agrarian caste western , shifted loyalties bjp general election hindu-muslim violence tore areas muzaffarnagar shamli districts 2013.kairana parliamentary constituency population 16 lakhs located shamli district one areas worst hit violence. choosing muslim candidate , rld - extension , opposition - hoping unite jat base muslim voters , form nearly half population kairana.at least 60 people , mainly muslims , killed 2013 western riots 50,000 displaced homes. hindu votes consolidated around bjp prime minister narendra modi wowed india campaign gave succulent victory. jats moved away rld return state election last year saw yogi adityanath take head uttar pradesh.when hukum singh bjp kairana , victory margin 2014 2.30 lakh votes combined votes sp , bsp rld. rld candidate tabassum hassan earlier kairana 2009 bsp ticket defeating hukum singh. time , takes daughterwhile campaigning state election last year , alleged nearly 350 hindu families fled muslim-dominated towns kairana kandhla due "" threats extortion criminal elements belonging particular community lack security.

2018-07-16,modi-shah leave bjp defenceless in karnataka - by yashwant sinha,"the sordid drama enacted by the bjp in karnataka has finally come to an end with the ignominious exit of its three-day chief minister bs yeddyurappa. his downfall was a foregone conclusion unless, as the bjp leaders camping in bengaluru were claiming, its recourse to the most shameless act of poaching other parties' mlas succeeded. since that did not happen because the mlas refused to be bought, the exercise sank into the septic tank. yet the karnataka episode will go down in as one of the sorriest chapters in our democratic history.the campaign for the assembly elections was bitter in itself. the prime minister threw all decency to the winds, as he did during the gujarat assembly elections, and attacked his rivals in a language which did not behoove his high office. his charge that generals cariappa and thimaiyya were insulted by the then congress regime fell short of facts. it was also in bad taste. after the bitterly fought elections, the results produced a hung assembly. the bjp emerged as the single largest party with 104 seats; the congress party's tally come down from 122 to 78 and the jd(s) was placed third with 38 seats. the bjp was seven short of majority in a house of 221 because elections were postponed in two assembly seats and kumaraswami had won from two seats. with the help of a pliant media, the bjp's seat tally was projected as an unprecedented victory and modi and shah were shown as great heroes of the electoral battlefield. let us look at some cold facts to see whether this indeed was an exceptional performance by the bjp.the 2018 election can and should be compared only with the 2008 election because in 2013, yeddyurappa had split the bjp, formed a new party and contested the elections under its banner. this had reduced the bjp's tally to only 40 seats in the assembly. in the 2013 election, the congress party had won 122 seats and secured a clear majority in the 224-member assembly. its vote share was 36.6%. it formed the government with siddharamaiah as the chief minister. in the karnataka elections, pm modi and amit shah were shown as great heroes of the electoral battlefield. (file)let us go back to 2008 with which alone a valid comparison can be made between the performance of the congress party and bjp. in that year, the bjp had won 110 seats with a vote share of 33.86%. the congress party had won only 86 seats but with a higher vote share of 35.3%. modi and shah were nowhere on the scene then as far as the karnataka elections were concerned. yet the bjp won 110 seats. do you remember anyone shouting from the housetops about the sterling leadership qualities of rajnath singh and his superb management skills as he was the party president then? it was celebrated as a significant victory no doubt, as for the first time, the bjp came to power on its own south of the vindhyas. the bjp then was only three seats short of the majority mark. the congress acted with alacrity and quickly offered the chief ministership to hd kumaraswamy. (file)today's chanakya and chandragupta of the bjp have not been able to replicate the victory of 2008, much less surpass it. yet, they are the greatest ever.a majority of the observers of the karnataka scene in this election were predicting that the congress party had an edge in the elections. and they were right,because the party was able to improve its share of votes from 36.6% in 2103 to 38% in 2018. but it lost out on the number of seats. the bjp's strike record was better than that of the congress party in 2008 also, as it was in the lok sabha elections in 2014 in which it was able to win more seats with a smaller percentage of the votes than its rivals. it's campaign ethics apart, the bjp covered itself with mud immediately after the announcement of the results. it was the single-largest party no doubt, but still seven short of a majority. but the congress party acted with alacrity and quickly offered the chief ministership to hd kumaraswamy, the leader of janta dal(s). they even informed the governor of this post-poll alliance which had a clear majority in the assembly as together they had 116 members. the two independent members also pledged support to this combination. the governor, an old bjp/rss man from gujarat, acting in utter disregard of the principle on which the bjp came to power in goa, manipur, meghalaya and bihar, and formed the government in jammu and kashmir, rejected the claim of the congress-jds combine, and in a stunning move which defied all logic invited the bjp leader yeddyurappa in the late evening of may 17 to take oath as chief minister the next morning. this was clearly meant to pre-empt any court intervention. further, he gave yeddyurappa 15 days to prove his majority on the floor of the house. it's another matter that the supreme court agreed to hear the petition of the congress-jd(s) combine during the night itself and while it did not stop yeddyurappa from taking oath, it ordered in a subsequent hearing on may 18 itself, to reduce the period of the floor test from 15 days to 24 hours. it also ordered that the pro-tem speaker would conduct the floor test in full glare of the media.googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display(""adslotnativevideo""); });the pro-tem speaker by convention is the senior-most member of the house. this was violated with impunity by chief minister yeddyurappa and more so by the governor, who, instead of appointing rv deshpande who is the senior-most mla in the house, appointed kg bopaiah as the pro-tem speaker. kg bopaiah was the speaker earlier also and the supreme court had passed strictures against him in a case were he had favoured yeddyurappa. the governor (l), an old bjp/rss man from gujarat, acted in utter disregard of the principle. (file)all these moves were clearly being orchestrated from delhi by the modi-shah team. this was in accordance with the new doctrine in the bjp that elections must be won at any cost. ethical considerations, norms and traditions of democracy do not matter. further, even if bjp does not get a majority, it must form the government by hook or by crook. yet the spokespersons of the bjp will climb the pulpit and preach sermons to others on ethics and morality.on may 19, shanta kumar, one of the senior-most leaders of the bjp announced that he would not contest the next lok sabha election. when asked about the goings-on in karnataka, he said that in 1982, the bjp had won 29 seats in the himachal pradesh assembly elections and the congress party had won 31. six independent mlas were ready to support the bjp to form the government. atal bihari vajpayee had then announced that the bjp would sit in the opposition rather than resort to horse-trading. where is that bjp today?unfortunately, today's bjp is not the bjp of atal-advani, which i had joined. it has been taken over by people to whom nothing matters more than power. i am glad i am out of it.the political mood in the country has changed dramatically after the events of karnataka. it has shown that the bjp can be outwitted at its own game. the ball is now squarely in the court of the parties in opposition.yashwant sinha, former bjp leader, was minister of finance (1998-2002) and minister of external affairs (2002-2004) disclaimer: the opinions expressed within this article are the personal opinions of the author. the facts and opinions appearing in the article do not reflect the views of ndtv and ndtv does not assume any responsibility or liability for the same.",0.1658033020370682,modi-shah leave bjp defenceless karnataka - yashwant sinha,"sordid drama enacted bjp karnataka finally come end ignominious exit three-day chief minister bs yeddyurappa. downfall foregone conclusion unless , bjp leaders camping bengaluru claiming , recourse shameless act poaching parties ' mlas succeeded. since happen mlas refused bought , exercise sank septic tank. yet karnataka episode go one sorriest chapters democratic history.the campaign assembly elections bitter itself. prime minister threw decency winds , gujarat assembly elections , attacked rivals language behoove high office. charge generals cariappa thimaiyya insulted congress regime fell short facts. also bad taste. bitterly fought elections , results produced hung assembly. bjp emerged single largest party 104 seats ; congress party ' tally come 122 78 jd( ) placed third 38 seats. bjp seven short majority house 221 elections postponed two assembly seats kumaraswami two seats. help pliant media , bjp ' seat tally projected unprecedented victory modi shah shown great heroes electoral battlefield. let us look cold facts see whether indeed exceptional performance bjp.the 2018 election compared 2008 election 2013 , yeddyurappa split bjp , formed new party contested elections banner. reduced bjp ' tally 40 seats assembly. 2013 election , congress party 122 seats secured clear majority 224-member assembly. vote share 36.6 % . formed government siddharamaiah chief minister. karnataka elections , pm modi amit shah shown great heroes electoral battlefield.
