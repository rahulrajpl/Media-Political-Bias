2015-03-20,"truth vs hype: anti-beef laws in maharashtra, haryana based more on hyperbole than facts","new delhi: under criticism for maharashtra's new cow protection law the bjp has denied any overt political motive. they claim the ban was important in the interests of indian agriculture. the same logic was used to defend tough new cow protection laws in haryana.but cow slaughter was already banned in both states. what the maharashtra law does is ban the slaughter of bullocks, which so far was permitted after the animal was declared unfit for agriculture.bjp mp from mumbai kirit somaiya who led the campaign to pass the maharashtra bill, defended the ban on bullock slaughter saying that even infirm animals help the agricultural economy by generating cow dung and urine. ""electricity or pumps are not yet available- we are talking about the bio-electricity,"" he said, meaning biogas, extracted from dung and other organic waste. also cattle urine, when mixed with neem, can be an effective pesticide.the vinayog parivar, an animal rights trust based in mumbai, which has lobbied for states to pass tougher cow protection laws, claims that nearly 30-40% of indian farmers use this urine-neem mix.but a standing committee of parliament suggests that bio-pesticides only make up 16% of all pesticide use. there is no mention of what proportion of that is composed of waste from cattle.moreover, there is little evidence to suggest that permitting slaughter of infirm cattle hurts agriculture. states which have the most liberal laws on cattle slaughter, like andhra pradesh, west bengal and tamil nadu - all of which permit the conditional slaughter of cows and bulls - have remained high performers agriculturally.west bengal retains the title of the biggest rice producing state in the country. andhra pradesh is in third place according to a government report on the value of agricultural output in 2013.in fact, farmer leaders say the ban on bull slaughter hurts their interests. raghunath dada patil, president of the maharashtra's shetkari sanghatan (farmers organisation) told ndtv that cattle, once past their prime, are a drain on farmers resources. ""slaughterhouses are our biggest buyers. it's our way to dispose of them and that's how work gets done. if the bjp is so against it, why don't they buy the cattle from us?""but groups in favour of the ban allege that healthy bullocks, even cows, are secretly slaughtered in abattoirs. ""everybody knows what's happening. they don't go by age or capacity of the animal. nobody was able to stop it,"" said somaiya.but at deonar, mumbai's biggest abattoir, they are aghast at the suggestion. deonar operates under mutliple government agencies - it is run by the mumbai municipal corporation, while doctors from the state government's animal husbandry department inspect each animal to ensure that it is unfit for agriculture before permitting slaughter. ""i've been working here for 20 years now. i've never heard of such things (cows being slaughtered),"" said vijay dhumal, the chief doctor in deonar.googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display(""adslotnativevideo""); });but pro-ban activists also allege that meat exporters secretly slaughter cows, pushing up india's meat export. the prime minister even referred to this as the congress government's ""pink revolution"" on the campaign trail last year.a representative from the meat exporters association pointed out that only buffalo meat is allowed for export, not beef.even if there are stray instances of illegal cow or bullock slaughter, there is little evidence to suggest that it as large a scale as the bjp alleges.the last animal census, in 2012, shows that the population of cows has grown by 3.5 per cent since the previous count in 2007. ""i don't think there is a threat to cattle. the population has in fact gone up in the last census,"" said kml pathak, deputy director general at the indian council for agricultural research's animal science department.the number of bulls, on the other hand, decreased by 16 percent during the same period. but this, said pathak, is because farmers are moving away from traditional agricultural practices. ""i don't agree the population is decreasing due to slaughter. the main reason is that the bull's utility has decreased in the past few years because of the rise in motorised farming,"" he said.moreover, india's status as the world's largest milk producer has not waned. the country increased milk production by 30 per cent between 2006 and 2013. maharashtra and haryana - the two states which have toughened beef laws - have also kept pace, growing by 24 per cent and 32 per cent respectively.""the population of animals has gone up in maharashtra; cow and buffalo milk production has also gone up. if all of them end up in the slaughterhouse, then who gives milk?"" asked dada patil.the claims about illegal, rampant slaughter of cattle seems to be backed more by myth and anecdote rather than any real evidence, which only adds to the perception that political motives more than farmers' interests, may have been driving these laws.",-0.02231409331409331,"truth vs hype : anti-beef laws maharashtra , haryana based hyperbole facts","new delhi : criticism maharashtra ' new cow protection law bjp denied overt political motive. claim ban important interests indian agriculture. logic used defend tough new cow protection laws haryana.but cow slaughter already banned states. maharashtra law ban slaughter bullocks , far permitted animal declared unfit agriculture.bjp mp mumbai kirit somaiya led campaign pass maharashtra bill , defended ban bullock slaughter saying even infirm animals help agricultural economy generating cow dung urine.

2015-10-03,beef is between my god and me," i've been thinking about this story ever since the man from dadri got killed because he was suspected to have eaten beef. i've been thinking of sharing what happened 20 years ago, because all around me, i see people acting in a strange manner, their own coping strategies to the news that our dinner plate is now food for politics.like my friend mq who put this out as his facebook status - ""i don't eat beef and nor do i store it in my fridge. with this declaration i hope not to be dragged out of my house and killed. inshallah i bought myself a few extra days to live, until the crazy freaks find another reason to kill.'' i love mq and to show my support, to tell him he's not alone in his fears, i wanted to like that post, or just add a comment to it, but it all seemed too inadequate to convey what we were all feeling. what i do have is the story of when i accidentally served beef to my god-fearing-vegetarian-on-saturdays-temple-going-parents.it happened when we'd first moved to london for my dad's tenure there for three years. it was one of the first weekends when we were still exploring the city and we landed in a fast food restaurant. i remember my father giving me his wallet, as was his habit, and asking me to get something for all of us. my younger brother went along with me, just to tell me what he wanted, and i remember ordering burgers and fries all around. it was all good till the trays arrived and we were back at the table.i remember that moment very clearly. i was grappling with how to get a bite of the burger without breaking it - when i noticed a small but clear print on the wrapping of my burger. it said ""made with 100% beef. horrified, i looked towards my parents - and my worst fears had come true - they'd had their first bite and now were on their second. how was this happening? didn't i order cheeseburgers? it didn't say beef anywhere on the menu, so how could this happen? it's the classic nightmare story that those who had moved abroad before us had told us, and i had made it true for my parents.i could barely eat while watching my parents ingest what they believed to be sin. i wanted to stop them so they could wash their mouth with some ganga jal when they went home but i was frozen at the thought of my father, sitting there with the sacred thread around his torso, chomping on the holy cow. these were hindus who went by the book, they never left home before doing puja and always turned the lights on with the evening puja. as a young teenager, i couldn't deal with the potential fury the fine print of their burger would unleash and so i swallowed my need to come clean, letting it eat into my conscience beef by beef.as the years went by with safer eating out ventures, and my teenage awkwardness receded, i shared everything with my parents, but this secret shame i couldn't reveal. the truth was i didn't forgive myself for letting them continue with eating those burgers - as if the sin mounted bite after bite. every time my parents would mention some story about avoiding beef at diplomatic dinners, i'd turn a little purple with fear.the guilt remained till my brother grew up and expressed the freedom of his own tastes. he ate beef, pork, especially the ones made by his friends' families from the north east. and once his friend's mum sent some specially made roast beef for my brother to eat. he relished it and then left the leftovers in the fridge. and what changed things for me was my mother's mild reaction, saying something like - ""oh ho, what all does he eat"", knowing fully well what was inside that box and that it was right next to her dal. this was the woman who wouldn't even eat garlic on saturdays, assigned vegetarian days, and who, along with my father, is still sticking to rituals like no non-vegetarian food for 15 days even if a fifth cousin dies!it was at that precise moment when i thought it's quite cool to be a hindu - your god seemed an understanding person who'd understand your need to try new things, who understood that sometimes you made mistakes, who was flexible with things. for instance, my brother never had his sacred thread ceremony when he reached puberty, but no problem, there was some make-up puja for it when he got married! my parents, born of parents who wouldn't eat chicken eggs because hens were unclean but ate duck eggs, never forced us to go to temples but practiced their faith in a way that my brother and i followed.and so it was in this way that i came to terms with the day i fed my parents beef. i finally confessed to my father before writing this piece and his reaction was as anti-climactic as my mother's had been to my brother's portion of beef in the fridge. if you asked my parents if they considered themselves proud hindus, they'd say yes without hesitation. so would i, probably. i know that many others wouldn't. i don't care though - that's between me and my god.(sunetra choudhury is editor, national affairs, ndtv 24x7)disclaimer: the opinions expressed within this article are the personal opinions of the author. the facts and opinions appearing in the article do not reflect the views of ndtv and ndtv does not assume any responsibility or liability for the same.

2015-10-04,fight the 'silence india' project," the senseless and bone-chilling lynching of a 50-year-old man at his home in his village just about 40 kms from the national capital should jolt us as a nation.mohd akhlaq and his son danish were assaulted by a blood-thirsty mob of about a hundred of their fellow villagers just because someone announced from the local temple that a cow calf had been slaughtered in the village. only two muslim families live in the main village, which is predominantly a rajput hamlet. the other house belonged to akhlaq's elder brother, who, incidentally, was out of the village on that fateful tuesday night. so the ""angry"", or the ""excited"" mob as the former bjp mla from dadri, nawab singh nagar, put it, descended on akhlaq's family like the agents of death.the madness lasted for about 30 minutes and left, apart from an old man dead and his son in icu, the amity of bisara in tatters and stained in akhlaq's and danish's blood.the alleged cow meat recovered from akhlaq's fridge is now with the forensic lab and some people have been arrested by the police for the murder. a magisterial probe has been ordered. the wheels of law will turn at their own pace. the test report of ""that meat"" is now immaterial. ""will they bring back my father, if it doesn't turn out to be beef?"" asked akhlaq's daughter.but the question that stares we the people in our face today is this: what took over that mob of bisara village on that night. the law might uncover in due course who killed akhlaq, but as a society, we have to face up to what killed akhlaq and left his son in the icu? was it just a gang of blood-thirsty murderers that got ""excited"" by an announcement from a temple? what sort of hate rushed through their minds and veins, blinding them for those 30 minutes in which they smashed a family that lived in their midst for decades, if not for generations, with brick and rods? what gripped akhlaq's neighbours that they became deaf to this one family's cries of pain and for help? what made a young girl from the village say that this ghastly act ""may be sad but will be a good deterrence for others""? yes, the sister of an accused actually said that!this incident cannot be seen in isolation. for months there has been a concerted effort to develop an anti-meat and anti-meat eaters' sentiment.this latest murder should also be seen in continuity with the recent killings of rationalists and with the lynching of a muslim man in kanpur who was branded a pakistani terrorist.it tells us a lot about the kind of society we are fast turning into. who are these people who go about ""teaching lessons"" to people? who has decided that law be damned in this country? instant and mob justice. my way or no way. fall in line or fall out.there is toxicity in the air. rank majoritarianism is fast becoming order of the day. the country is sought to be divided in clear, binary, black and white us vs them quarters. live according to what is being sold as the majority view or be prepared to die. and the worst part is there are many in the real and the virtual world who dish out justifications to all the barbarities and excesses. a wave of hate has hit the country and is threatening to engulf all those who refuse to swim along.and people seem to be happy surfing this wave at the moment. it gives a temporary politically hormonal rush but deep down are the currents of hatred that propel this wave. this hatred won't stop at the libtards, sickulars, minorities, beef eaters. it will turn against all and sundry. it won't stop till people are converted into unthinking, walking zombies who do nothing but prostate in front of the hate.we have a tall task. to save our country, our sanity from getting drowned in this black hole of hate that churns out the mob like the one in dadri.there is a grand ""silence india"" project going on. the only antidote to it is the noise of democracy. shout, scream, stand up. this country is much more than a boring, unilateral, skewed narrative.there is a mob out there. and the choice is simple. shout it down or wait for your turn.(mohd asim is senior news editor, ndtv 24x7)disclaimer: the opinions expressed within this article are the personal opinions of the author. the facts and opinions appearing in the article do not reflect the views of ndtv and ndtv does not assume any responsibility or liability for the same.",-0.024512365029606416,fight ' silence india ' project,"senseless bone-chilling lynching 50-year-old man home village 40 kms national capital jolt us nation.mohd akhlaq son danish assaulted blood-thirsty mob hundred fellow villagers someone announced local temple cow calf slaughtered village. two muslim families live main village , predominantly rajput hamlet. house belonged akhlaq ' elder brother , , incidentally , village fateful tuesday night.

2015-10-11,you can call me pseudo-sickular," so i am a beef-eating hindu brahmin, married to a south african of no religious affiliation. i am a trained bharat natyam dancer and i also love hip-hop, belly-dancing and jazz ballet. i studied sanskrit and tamil as second languages along with hindi which i still struggle to speak with correct grammar and pronounciation, making english my first language. tamil is my mother tongue. i love yoga, i love chanting sanskrit shlokas but over and above all of that, i am a woman and an indian.my culture - and i mean mine personally - is one of lovely contradictions. no one can tell me i am not hindu. no text can tell me how exactly to be one. no, the ramayana is a story, not the ""word"" like the bible or the quran. in fact, i prefer the mahabharata any day. my mother is a pure vegetarian, my father is not. he taught me that the sunrise, a little bird song, a tall tree are all god. he taught me that the observer, me and the observed, the universe are intimately entwined. he taught me if we do not see ourselves in others, then there is no beauty to being human.so when dangerous nitwits try and circumscribe me into narrow boxes with their filtered jingoistic take on hinduism, it makes me wonder what kind of people they are, and do they even see india the way i do? let me say that i am not going to romanticize my view of india. i see the poverty, the helplessness, the garbage, the corruption, the violence. i wake up to stories of an old muslim man killed by a mob on the suspicion he was eating beef. his younger son was also beaten badly. his older son is an engineer in the iaf. i wake up to news that a khap panchayat, that lovely bastion of patriarchal kangaroo court justice, ordered the rape of two sisters because their brother married outside his caste. caste. paint it whichever way you like, it's a sick degrading practice, as much an apartheid as the old system in south africa, the country in which i now live. i have seen more racism in india than i have here in south africa. i was called a ""madrasi"" casually by people who would be shocked if you told them they were parochial idiots. i have alternately been asked how i am not dark as all madrasis are and also been told by an acquaintance that her summer holidays made her as dark as me. on work for a shoot at the taj mahal, the ticket window guy argued that my camera person had to pay the foreigner rate because he was korean. my camera person was from manipur. i was flatly told we were lying as indians did not look like him. it's not just north india but also south india that has all these issues. so, no, i have no romantic view of india.but i have also seen another india, travelled in it, lived in it, been told stories about it. in that india, i have been fed without having to ask, been welcomed without questions, seen unbelievable dignity in the face of all odds. i remembered a story of how the great bismillah khan was once on a train and when it stopped at a station, he heard a most haunting melody, a raga he could not identify. it was a young boy walking through the train playing the flute. he stopped near the ustad, and the ustad was mesmerized by the tune. and just as suddenly as the boy came, he left. the ustad was convinced he had been in the presence of divinity. he swore the young boy who played for him was none other than lord krishna. ustad was on his way to the kumbh mela to perform, in a profoundly hindu festival. when he did perform, he played the raga he heard the boy play and that raga was called kanhaira by him.my hinduism is simple. it is ""aham brahmasmi"" or ""the core of my being is the ultimate reality, the root and ground of the universe, the source of all that exists."" there is only one supreme being and it is the super consciousness, from which we all sprang and into which we will all be absorbed. just as a seed carries the secret of a mighty tree within, we carry the supreme conciousness. when that is the central philosophy of hinduism, where the microcosm and the macrocosm are linked in an infinite beautiful cycle, how can i ever accept what the extreme right wing would like to see as hinduism? when hinduism, a way of life, a philosophy that roots itself in a bedrock of tolerance, is twisted into narrow rules and regulations trapped by bars of hate, i cannot and will not accept it. when my hinduism, asks me to believe in athithi devo bavah, or ""the guest is god"", when it asks me to find god in myself because tatvamasi is the heart of the matter and therefore makes me find the divine in others, how can the rule makers separate us into individuals instead of humanity? my hinduism is stories i danced to. when bhakt jayadeva wrote the geeta govindam while writing of the love between radha and krishna, he spontaneously composed a line, ""dehi pada pallava mudharam"" or ""krishna asked radha to place her lotus-like feet on his head."" appalled by this thought that had come to his head, jayadeva left the house to go bathe and clear his thoughts. a few minutes later, much to his wife's surprise, he came back and sat down and wrote and left again. a few minutes later he came back again. he sat down and then with great anger asked his wife how she could have written the words that were such an insult to god, his wife, most puzzled, said that he himself had just come back and written them and that's when jayadeva knew it was krishna himself who had done so. god was saying that in the presence of love, even god is the lesser. yet, today, we hate, hate so much. that is not my hinduism.in our culture we will ignore that charvaka is an ancient hindu philosophy that embraces philosophical skepticism and rejects the vedas, vedic ritualism and supernaturalism. it encourages questions and arguments. established by brihaspati, one of our most venerated sages. yet we will murder professors and social workers who subscribe to it. our gayatri mantra, asks for the benevolent light of the sun, the life giver, to inspire our intelligence, to inspire our understanding and to banish ignorance and bathe us in enlightenment. where is any of that now? in our culture, we will ignore that all meat was consumed by hindus in the vedic times and erase that part of history. indeed that over 60% of india eats meat is rejected. i reject that hinduism. that narrow confined box.you can call me a pseudo sickular liberal presstitute. i will just bow and say namaste, which means ""i greet the divine in you"".(swati thiyagarajan is an environment editor with ndtv)disclaimer: the opinions expressed within this article are the personal opinions of the author. the facts and opinions appearing in the article do not reflect the views of ndtv and ndtv does not assume any responsibility or liability for the same.",0.023241157935035485,call pseudo-sickular,"beef-eating hindu brahmin , married south african religious affiliation. trained bharat natyam dancer also love hip-hop , belly-dancing jazz ballet. studied sanskrit tamil second languages along hindi still struggle speak correct grammar pronounciation , making english first language. tamil mother tongue. love yoga , love chanting sanskrit shlokas , woman indian.my culture - mean mine personally - one lovely contradictions. one tell hindu. text tell exactly one. , ramayana story , "" word "" like bible quran. fact , prefer mahabharata day. mother pure vegetarian , father not. taught sunrise , little bird song , tall tree god. taught observer , observed , universe intimately entwined. taught see others , beauty human.so dangerous nitwits try circumscribe narrow boxes filtered jingoistic take hinduism , makes wonder kind people , even see india way ?

2015-10-19,the hypocrisy of the bjp and cow slaughter," ignorance can be condoned and remedied. bigotry and prejudice as has been displayed by the haryana chief minister in his open threats to the muslim community under the guise of protection of the cow should come under provisions of hate speech and be dealt with by the law.such statements by leaders have a direct impact on the actions of their supporters. the hate campaign in the name of prevention of cow slaughter has taken its toll of another young muslim life in himachal pradesh. this follows the attacks on cattle traders in mainpuri. in response to a question after the lynching in dadri, the prime minister had replied, ""what has the central government to do with it? it is for the state government to respond.""this is like an arsonist blaming the fire services for not coming in time to douse the fire he has lit.when cabinet ministers or members of parliament belonging to the ruling party make inflammatory statements which have direct consequences in inciting violence against the muslim community, the centre has everything to do with it. removing them from their posts would, for example, have an immediate and salutary impact in preventing others from making such statements, but this is not the preferred path because of the larger more fundamental agenda of the hindutva forces of polarizing india on religious lines, with which the prime minister clearly agrees.this is not to say that state governments have no responsibility. certainly, the uttar pradesh government is answerable for its failure in preventing the spread of communal feelings by the rss and its cohorts. it is equally responsible for the provocative statements made by serial offenders like minister azam khan against whom action should be taken.the snowballing impact of the hindutva offensive on the issue of cow slaughter was felt last week when the himachal pradesh high court in a questionable judgement asked the central government to ""consider to enact the law prohibiting slaughtering of cow/calf, import or export of cow/calf, selling of beef or beef products, in its own wisdom at the national level, within a period of three months""...it also gave a directive to the central government ""to provide funds for the upkeep of stray cattle.""not surprisingly, this has immediately been picked up by the vishwa hindu praishad to demand such a national law. there is a deliberate attempt to whip up a feeling that cow slaughter is rampant because of weak laws.the 2012 cattle census shows that there has been an increase in the number of cows in india by 6.2 per cent compared to the previous census in 2007 whereas the numbers of sheep, goats and pigs declined. this hardly points to rampant slaughter of cows. secondly, most states in india, with the exception of the north eastern states already have laws prohibiting the slaughter of cows and their progeny. however, most of these states allow the slaughter of draught animals including bulls and bullocks if the cattle are found to be ""unfit for work or for breeding"" and certified to be fit for slaughter.according to the website of the animal husbandry department of the government of india, such states which permit slaughter of ""useless cattle"" include andhra pradesh, assam, bihar, goa, karnataka, kerala, madhya pradesh, maharashtra, odisha, tamil nadu, uttar pradesh, west bengal. the procedures and standards for slaughter may differ - such as the age of the animal which can vary from 10 years in kerala to 15 years in madhya pradesh. in some states such as bengal and tamil nadu and kerala, dry cows can also be slaughtered.this is quite in tune with article 48 of the directive principles of the constitution, which gave special protection to the cow not for religious reasons but on grounds of ""scientific agriculture"" and for ""taking steps for preserving and improving the breed and for prohibiting the slaughter of cows and calves and other milch and draught cattle."" of course this article itself was a compromise worked out with the proponents of a national ban on cow slaughter by dr ambedkar in the constituent assembly, who was opposed to such a ban.but with the advent of the modi regime, the hindutva right wing wants to reverse the compromise, change the legal provisions and extend it to a total ban removing the ""fit for slaughter"" provisions and also to link it with a ban on the consumption of beef. this has been done by the bjp government in maharashtra as well as haryana this year and earlier by gujarat in 2005.however, the purpose is less for the protection of the cow than for targeting the muslim community. this agenda also requires the rewriting of history and the creation of a narrative that cow slaughter was introduced by muslims. the national commission on cattle set up by the vajpayee government in 2002 asserts ""cow slaughter in india first started around 1000 ad when various islamic invaders came to this country.."" (introductory chapter, para 25). the works of eminent historians showing how beef was an integral part of the dietary preferences of ancient india are brushed aside as the ""propaganda of leftists.""swamy vivekananda in a series of lectures published in volume 3 of his collected works had this to say: ""you will be astonished if i tell you that according to the old ceremonials, he is not a good hindu who does not eat beef. on certain occasions he must sacrifice a bull and eat it..."" again: ""there was a time in this very india without eating beef no brahmin could remain a brahmin...in time it was found that as we were an agricultural race, killing the best bulls meant annihilation of the race. therefore the practice was stopped and a voice was raised against the killing of cows...""the rewriting of history goes along with falsehoods about the realities of the present. khattar's comments were deliberately aimed against muslims when it is well known that more than muslims or christians in the north east, beef is the dietary preference of a substantial section of hindus too. the commission report also reluctantly admitted (para 167) that ""extreme poverty and customary practices in the coastal areas and among some sections of scheduled tribes, scheduled castes and other backward castes also make them beef eaters."" clearly the issue of beef consumption also has a class and caste dimension.but such is the power of the goebbelsian lie that after dadri, when lalu yadav said that hindus too are beef eaters, he was so aggressively attacked by the bjp that he felt it was better to deny he had ever made such a comment!the communal and divisive mobilisation also helps to conceal the utter hypocrisy of the anti cow slaughter campaign. the demand for a total ban on slaughter of all cattle even those who are legally ""fit for slaughter"" is in total contrast to the plight of such cattle.according to the cattle census of 2012, there are 53 lakh stray cattle including cows, bullocks and bulls. these cattle have been turned out by the peasants who own them because it is not economically viable to look after them. on a conservative estimate, maintenance of a dry cow or useless cattle will cost a hundred rupees a day. this is precisely why in an earlier judgement the supreme court had held that a "" total ban on slaughter of useless cattle which involves a wasteful drain on the nation...cannot be justified.""the plight of such stray cattle, including dry cows, slowly starving to death or dying because of ingestion of toxic wastes including plastic does not however move the hindutva forces. in states, where they are in power such as gujarat, madhya pradesh, chhattisgarh, the numbers of such stray cattle are large. at an all-india level, the minimum cost of feeding 53 lakh stray cattle would be around 20,000 crores rupees a year at 100 rupees per head. this is more than the entire amount allocated for the scheduled tribe sub plan in this year's budget. but the concern for the cow does not stretch to finances. in haryana, for example mr. khattar gives only 40 rupees per head of cattle to registered gaushalas. since these gaushalas also include milch cattle which require a different more expensive diet, the useless cattle even in gaushalas starve to death.such is the hypocrisy of the hindutva right.india does not need a national anti cow slaughter law. it does not require laws that determine dietary preferences of its citizens. it has other priorities it should be addressing such as being the country with the highest malnourished population in the world.(brinda karat is a politburo member of the cpi(m) and a former member of the rajya sabha.)disclaimer: the opinions expressed within this article are the personal opinions of the author. the facts and opinions appearing in the article do not reflect the views of ndtv and ndtv does not assume any responsibility or liability for the same.",0.010052424639580606,hypocrisy bjp cow slaughter,"ignorance condoned remedied. bigotry prejudice displayed haryana chief minister open threats muslim community guise protection cow come provisions hate speech dealt law.such statements leaders direct impact actions supporters. hate campaign name prevention cow slaughter taken toll another young muslim life himachal pradesh. follows attacks cattle traders mainpuri. response question lynching dadri , prime minister replied , "" central government ? state government respond.

2015-10-19,the hypocrisy of the bjp and cow slaughter," ignorance can be condoned and remedied. bigotry and prejudice as has been displayed by the haryana chief minister in his open threats to the muslim community under the guise of protection of the cow should come under provisions of hate speech and be dealt with by the law.such statements by leaders have a direct impact on the actions of their supporters. the hate campaign in the name of prevention of cow slaughter has taken its toll of another young muslim life in himachal pradesh. this follows the attacks on cattle traders in mainpuri. in response to a question after the lynching in dadri, the prime minister had replied, ""what has the central government to do with it? it is for the state government to respond.""this is like an arsonist blaming the fire services for not coming in time to douse the fire he has lit.when cabinet ministers or members of parliament belonging to the ruling party make inflammatory statements which have direct consequences in inciting violence against the muslim community, the centre has everything to do with it. removing them from their posts would, for example, have an immediate and salutary impact in preventing others from making such statements, but this is not the preferred path because of the larger more fundamental agenda of the hindutva forces of polarizing india on religious lines, with which the prime minister clearly agrees.this is not to say that state governments have no responsibility. certainly, the uttar pradesh government is answerable for its failure in preventing the spread of communal feelings by the rss and its cohorts. it is equally responsible for the provocative statements made by serial offenders like minister azam khan against whom action should be taken.the snowballing impact of the hindutva offensive on the issue of cow slaughter was felt last week when the himachal pradesh high court in a questionable judgement asked the central government to ""consider to enact the law prohibiting slaughtering of cow/calf, import or export of cow/calf, selling of beef or beef products, in its own wisdom at the national level, within a period of three months""...it also gave a directive to the central government ""to provide funds for the upkeep of stray cattle.""not surprisingly, this has immediately been picked up by the vishwa hindu praishad to demand such a national law. there is a deliberate attempt to whip up a feeling that cow slaughter is rampant because of weak laws.the 2012 cattle census shows that there has been an increase in the number of cows in india by 6.2 per cent compared to the previous census in 2007 whereas the numbers of sheep, goats and pigs declined. this hardly points to rampant slaughter of cows. secondly, most states in india, with the exception of the north eastern states already have laws prohibiting the slaughter of cows and their progeny. however, most of these states allow the slaughter of draught animals including bulls and bullocks if the cattle are found to be ""unfit for work or for breeding"" and certified to be fit for slaughter.according to the website of the animal husbandry department of the government of india, such states which permit slaughter of ""useless cattle"" include andhra pradesh, assam, bihar, goa, karnataka, kerala, madhya pradesh, maharashtra, odisha, tamil nadu, uttar pradesh, west bengal. the procedures and standards for slaughter may differ - such as the age of the animal which can vary from 10 years in kerala to 15 years in madhya pradesh. in some states such as bengal and tamil nadu and kerala, dry cows can also be slaughtered.this is quite in tune with article 48 of the directive principles of the constitution, which gave special protection to the cow not for religious reasons but on grounds of ""scientific agriculture"" and for ""taking steps for preserving and improving the breed and for prohibiting the slaughter of cows and calves and other milch and draught cattle."" of course this article itself was a compromise worked out with the proponents of a national ban on cow slaughter by dr ambedkar in the constituent assembly, who was opposed to such a ban.but with the advent of the modi regime, the hindutva right wing wants to reverse the compromise, change the legal provisions and extend it to a total ban removing the ""fit for slaughter"" provisions and also to link it with a ban on the consumption of beef. this has been done by the bjp government in maharashtra as well as haryana this year and earlier by gujarat in 2005.however, the purpose is less for the protection of the cow than for targeting the muslim community. this agenda also requires the rewriting of history and the creation of a narrative that cow slaughter was introduced by muslims. the national commission on cattle set up by the vajpayee government in 2002 asserts ""cow slaughter in india first started around 1000 ad when various islamic invaders came to this country.."" (introductory chapter, para 25). the works of eminent historians showing how beef was an integral part of the dietary preferences of ancient india are brushed aside as the ""propaganda of leftists.""swamy vivekananda in a series of lectures published in volume 3 of his collected works had this to say: ""you will be astonished if i tell you that according to the old ceremonials, he is not a good hindu who does not eat beef. on certain occasions he must sacrifice a bull and eat it..."" again: ""there was a time in this very india without eating beef no brahmin could remain a brahmin...in time it was found that as we were an agricultural race, killing the best bulls meant annihilation of the race. therefore the practice was stopped and a voice was raised against the killing of cows...""the rewriting of history goes along with falsehoods about the realities of the present. khattar's comments were deliberately aimed against muslims when it is well known that more than muslims or christians in the north east, beef is the dietary preference of a substantial section of hindus too. the commission report also reluctantly admitted (para 167) that ""extreme poverty and customary practices in the coastal areas and among some sections of scheduled tribes, scheduled castes and other backward castes also make them beef eaters."" clearly the issue of beef consumption also has a class and caste dimension.but such is the power of the goebbelsian lie that after dadri, when lalu yadav said that hindus too are beef eaters, he was so aggressively attacked by the bjp that he felt it was better to deny he had ever made such a comment!the communal and divisive mobilisation also helps to conceal the utter hypocrisy of the anti cow slaughter campaign. the demand for a total ban on slaughter of all cattle even those who are legally ""fit for slaughter"" is in total contrast to the plight of such cattle.according to the cattle census of 2012, there are 53 lakh stray cattle including cows, bullocks and bulls. these cattle have been turned out by the peasants who own them because it is not economically viable to look after them. on a conservative estimate, maintenance of a dry cow or useless cattle will cost a hundred rupees a day. this is precisely why in an earlier judgement the supreme court had held that a "" total ban on slaughter of useless cattle which involves a wasteful drain on the nation...cannot be justified.""the plight of such stray cattle, including dry cows, slowly starving to death or dying because of ingestion of toxic wastes including plastic does not however move the hindutva forces. in states, where they are in power such as gujarat, madhya pradesh, chhattisgarh, the numbers of such stray cattle are large. at an all-india level, the minimum cost of feeding 53 lakh stray cattle would be around 20,000 crores rupees a year at 100 rupees per head. this is more than the entire amount allocated for the scheduled tribe sub plan in this year's budget. but the concern for the cow does not stretch to finances. in haryana, for example mr. khattar gives only 40 rupees per head of cattle to registered gaushalas. since these gaushalas also include milch cattle which require a different more expensive diet, the useless cattle even in gaushalas starve to death.such is the hypocrisy of the hindutva right.india does not need a national anti cow slaughter law. it does not require laws that determine dietary preferences of its citizens. it has other priorities it should be addressing such as being the country with the highest malnourished population in the world.(brinda karat is a politburo member of the cpi(m) and a former member of the rajya sabha.)disclaimer: the opinions expressed within this article are the personal opinions of the author. the facts and opinions appearing in the article do not reflect the views of ndtv and ndtv does not assume any responsibility or liability for the same.",0.010052424639580606,hypocrisy bjp cow slaughter,"ignorance condoned remedied. bigotry prejudice displayed haryana chief minister open threats muslim community guise protection cow come provisions hate speech dealt law.such statements leaders direct impact actions supporters. hate campaign name prevention cow slaughter taken toll another young muslim life himachal pradesh. follows attacks cattle traders mainpuri. response question lynching dadri , prime minister replied , "" central government ? state government respond.

2015-10-20,gai pe charcha: bjp and cow violence," for nearly three weeks after the dadri lynching, the prime minister, confronted by mounting pressure to respond, oscillated between ducking the issue by keeping silent, turning it into a wider existential clash between hindus and muslims, and finally describing it as a 'sad incident' while drawing an administrative distinction: ""what do incidents like dadri,"" he asked, ""have to do with the centre?""we are now told that the prime minister is ""angry"" with the incendiary statements made by his party colleagues. they were in turn summoned by party president amit shah and given a dressing down. characteristically, some of them have denied this.while this may or may not assuage those still awaiting a more convincing response, it isn't quite clear why the prime minister is angry. after all, the troops were dutifully following the general's lead.in the campaign for the national elections, the repeated ""pink revolution"" references by mr modi, then the party's prime ministerial candidate, inserted the alarmist, cow-under-attack rhetoric into the national conversation. his primary contention (which underwent mild variations in each speech): the upa government was promoting the large scale illegal - and immoral - slaughter of cows, thereby bringing in a ""pink revolution.""in bihar, for instance, in a speech on april 2, 2014, he taunted lalu yadav, who comes from the caste of gau-palaks (cow rearers) for forging an alliance with a upa that experiences garv (pride) at the massacre of cattle. by way of proof, mr modi spoke of the subsidies to the meat industry given by the upa, and of the existence of large slaughterhouses everywhere. this, he explained to a crowd in ghaziabad in western uttar pradesh two days later, is the upa's pink revolution, which wants ''india to be made the biggest meat exporter,"" a series of clever distortions and half-truths to conceal the larger lie of the cow in peril.it is true that india's meat exports have steadily risen in the past several decades. but even as campaigner, mr modi would have known that government rules only permit the export of buffalo meat, not cow. buffalo is technically not classified as beef by the government, even if it is treated as such in some of the countries it is exported to.the upa subsidy was for the agri-food export industry as a whole, of which meat export is a component.as for the possibility of illegal killing of cows in slaughterhouses bound for export, here is what db sabharwal, a representative of india's meat exports association had to say: ""there are 66 meat processing plants registered with the state and central government, which are only allowed for export. in each of these plants, a government veterinary doctor is posted at the gate and at the plant who does the ante-mortem and the post-mortem of the buffalo. in each plant, there are cctv cameras installed all over as per the instruction of the state government. in most of the countries which are importing meat, some of them post their own veterinary doctors in the plants to ensure that the quality is safe and that it is buffalo meat. in addition, everything is monitored on the website and each animal when it goes for slaughter, it is accounted for and the meat from that animal is also accounted for.""moreover, the approximately rs 27,000 crore buffalo meat export trade is not the monopoly of a single religion; the recent discovery that a particularly acid-tongued bjp mla had part ownership of a meat export firm for three years only underlines the fallacy of making such divisive insinuations. in light of this, for mr modi's assertion to hold true - that india, is in effect illicitly exporting a buffalo-cow mix - would involve a sinister, decades-long collusion between central and state governments, meat traders, exporters and perhaps even consumers in the 65 countries to whom india exports meat (of which the three biggest are vietnam, malaysia, and thailand). it was a breathtakingly provocative claim for a politician of his stature; if he had proof to back it up, it is yet to be shared with the indian public.but with one stroke, he was handing to the dangerous ecosystem of self-styled gau-rakshaks their 'aha!' moment. damn the evidence, they could now say (and they do) - no less than the prime ministerial candidate is airing the very conspiracy theories they deployed to justify their vigilantism.it can be no one's case that violence over cow slaughter is a new phenomenon; if anything, it occupies one of the oldest chapters in our communal history. which is why the freedom for states to pass cow protection laws was given a constitutional mandate under the directive principles. as a result, over the past five decades, all but 11 states have banned cow slaughter outright. the cow slaughter debate, at least in theory, ought to have been settled, but for individuals and groups - some of whom owe direct allegiance to the hindu right, others whose links are more ambiguous - who have kept alive the myth of 'cow in peril' through a volatile mix of half-truths and rumour.this attack-first-proof-be-damned modus operandi is evident in the killing in dadri and in similar assaults. there is today a partial curfew in many parts of kashmir over the killing of a man after a mob in udhampur firebombed a truck he was driving. the grounds: that he and the others in the truck had illegally killed two cows. the police found that the cows had died of food poisoning. the truck was transporting coal. in mainpuri in uttar pradesh, the ""discovery""of the skinning of an already dead cow led to a near-riot and the near-lynching of four men. police suspect that the son of the man who gave the dead cow to the men for skinning had tipped off the mob.we were witness firsthand to prevarications of these groups when, ten days after dadri, we filmed with the gau raksha dal, a self-described cattle protection group based in haryana, but with units across north india. they had called us to a temple compound in east delhi, where, flanked by local members of the bjp, they claimed to have rescued two trucks of cows bound for slaughter to uttar pradesh (where cow slaughter is banned). when we asked how the simple stoppage of a truck automatically establishes the cattle inside were being transported for slaughter, a bjp person present changed tack, saying it was a violation of animal cruelty laws, which stipulate that cattle need to be transported under certain guidelines. even if this was the case, it has less incendiary potential than claiming cow slaughter, not to mention milder punishment under the law.also, the ""rescued"" cows in this case were not cows at all, but bullocks. (this turns out to be true for almost all their videos, and a good amount of the propaganda material we were shown by similar groups in uttar pradesh and maharashtra). the bull, in popular imagination, does not carry the same emotive charge as gau mata. in fact some states which ban cow slaughter - like maharashtra, until recently - permit the slaughter of bulls after they have been certified as infirm.how did the dal explain this anomaly? they did not. standing next to a herd of emaciated bulls, they threatened the worst possible fate for anyone caught harming the gau mata.but it can be said with confidence that the images from delhi would have already passed into the self-sustaining loop of context-less, time-less, date-less images (or increasingly, whatsapp videos) of cattle ""rescues"" or even gory carcasses that we have been shown by similar outfits as far apart as maharashtra, haryana, and uttar pradesh. in almost every case, there is very little indication of where or when these were shot, what was the specific illegality, whether a case was registered, and if so, what was the outcome. instead, each image, each video or anecdote validates the other, creating the perception of large-scale illegal cow slaughter.the power of rumour allows the cow vigilantes to bypass what is a more likely scenario: an illicit cattle trade far smaller in scale than their hysteria will have us believe.even such as it exists, it has less to do with an islamic conspiracy and more with the compulsions of the cattle economy, where farmers sell livestock that they have no use for to meat traders. for the most part, these take place inside government-run cattle markets, where scope for illegality is slim. but there are bound to be outliers, of cattle changing hands outside the purview of local laws. the solution to this is not harsher cattle protection laws and increased vigilantism - which only increases the possibility of illegal transactions - but to address the question of potential remuneration to the farmer.in maharashtra, farmers' groups that protested alongside meat traders after the state government extended the ban to infirm bulls posed the question most directly: ""if the hinduvatva-waadis are so fond of the gau, why don't they come to the market and buy it from us?"" several cow protection groups we have posed this question to had no answer. for good reason. foregrounding the role of the farmer and of cattle economics deflates the selective, communalised narrative of gau-rakshaks, raising questions about their true motive: is it to protect cows, or to use exaggerated myths of the cow in crisis to stoke sectarian tension, even political gain?that this vigilantism is allowed to operate with impunity is a disgrace to the law and order machinery of all governments, regardless of political colour. the gau raksha dal, for instance, has operated for years in what was until recently congress-run haryana.but the blind eye policy came with an unspoken rider - that the alarmist and rumour-powered grammar of cow paranoia will not leak into the higher tiers of political establishment, even by those who may privately sympathise with its proponents. in the case of the rss parivar, it has been until now largely left to the domain of the vhp, the bajrang dal, or within the bjp to the adityanaths and sakshi maharajs.that is why the current political regime stands answerable today - starting with the prime minister himself, for breaking this unspoken lakshman rekha with his pink revolution remarks.even if he could be forgiven the poetic license of the campaign trail, where are the prosaic clarifications once in power? the mob may understandably want nothing to do with inconvenient statistics, but that fig leaf cannot extend indefinitely upwards. the last animal census conducted between 2007-2012 finds that the indian cow population grew 6.5%. overall, though, its growth rate is 1.5% less than that of the female buffalo.this, according to kml pathak, an animal scientist at the indian council for agricultural research, is due to simple economics: buffaloes have higher, richer milk yield. ""milk prices are fixed on the fat percentage. the fat percentage in buffalo milk is more than cow's milk,"" said pathak. ""that's why there's an increase in the buffalo over cattle population.""the only drop of any significance has been in the population of the bull, which has no dairy benefits, and has fallen by 19 %. according to pathak, the main reason for this is the increased preference for mechanised farming.instead of the toning down of cow rhetoric, we have the chief ministers of two states where the bjp registered a significant electoral victory, again on the back of a mandate seemingly for progressive governance, making much of passing anti-beef laws. on cue, both drew praise from bjp president amit shah, who in his speech to the party national executive in april this year, praised maharashtra and haryana for proving that only the bjp has the interests of the cow on its mind.this is, of course, another clever evasion. cow slaughter was already banned in both states for years. haryana merely made the laws tougher, while maharashtra extended the ban to bull slaughter. it's hard to gauge what these announcements achieved on practical terms, other than keeping alive cow-alarmism.even after dadri, and the first round of supposed disapproval expressed at the highest level, the bjp/nda's cow-pitch remained high: the otherwise moderately inclined sushil modi began to speak of a cow slaughter ban in bihar (which, again, already has such laws). a minister in the haryana government is running an opinion poll to replace the tiger with the cow as national animal. his boss, the chief minister, made a statement (which he later claimed was a misrepresentation) saying muslims can continue to live in india, but they will have to give up eating beef.why then is the bjp surprised that its centre of power will be held to account when murders are taking place on manufactured rumours of cow slaughter? even if not the administrative centre that the prime minister sought to absolve of responsibility, what about the party's political centre which lit the spark in 2014 and has since kept the flame on slow burn? is it surprising, furthermore, that the supposed chastisements of party hotheads will continue to be viewed with skepticism, given the closed-door, source-based manner in which they were conveyed?since the killing of mohammad akhlaq in dadri village, the district magistrate of gautam buddh nagar, under whom dadri falls, has been going from village to village speaking of the gradual leak of poisonous propaganda into the veins of impressionable young men. the bjp's top brass needs to decide whether it is sincere about turning off the tap, or letting the slow drip continue.(with inputs from manas roshan)sreenivasan jain is managing editor ndtv 24x7 and anchors the ground-report show truth-vs-hype.disclaimer: the opinions expressed within this article are the personal opinions of the author. the facts and opinions appearing in the article do not reflect the views of ndtv and ndtv does not assume any responsibility or liability for the same.",0.012574218248302021,gai pe charcha : bjp cow violence,"nearly three weeks dadri lynching , prime minister , confronted mounting pressure respond , oscillated ducking issue keeping silent , turning wider existential clash hindus muslims , finally describing ' sad incident ' drawing administrative distinction : "" incidents like dadri , "" asked , "" centre ?

2015-10-31,why pakistan won't burst crackers if bjp loses bihar," in an election address in bihar yesterday, the bharatiya janata party's election chanakya and president expressed concern about crackers in pakistan. ""even if by mistake,"" he said, and repeated the caveat, ""should the bjp lose bihar, there will be fireworks in pakistan. would you like that?""by now i don't know what the bjp is seeking votes in bihar for: for the ganga of development to flow in the state, to ban cow slaughter which has already been banned here since 1955, to save or disturb affirmative action for the lower castes, or to prevent fireworks in pakistan.let us take his statement at face value for a moment, and not infer it to mean that muslims in bihar would happy to see the bjp lose.amit shah's concern over firecrackers in pakistan not only reveals his anxiety over the numbers that november 8, counting day, will throw up, but also what he thinks the bjp represents in pakistan. he seems to suggest that pakistan likes the bjp to be out of power in india. this is not true.the truth is, many in pakistan were looking forward to narendra modi becoming prime minister. if you glance at media coverage from pakistan around the 2014 general elections, it was quite positive.for one, many pakistanis think the bjp is better placed for an india-pakistan detente. as a right-wing party, it whips up nationalist paranoia when the congress tries to do the same. liberal pakistanis fondly remember how atal bihari vajpayee was able to push india-pakistan peace, both before and after kargil. the congress' dr manmohan singh didn't even have the support of his own party to pursue peace with pakistan beyond a point.secondly, the trade lobby in pakistan thought that narendra modi, like nawaz sharif, was more openly for laissez faire than the congress was, and would thus be good news for india-pakistan trade.these hopes haven't come true, because they were silly in the first place. for liberal pakistanis to think the indian right-wing in power is good for crossing the wagah border is akin to indians loving general pervez musharraf in power.thirdly and most importantly, modi's ascent has been the best news for the pakistani right-wing. why just right-wing, even a liberal pakistani friend told me why he was happy to see modi take the prime minister's office. ""india's secular mask needed to go,"" he said. ""india pretended to be this secular country and pakistan looked bad in contrast.""it goes further. pakistan's formative idea is the two-nation theory, the idea that hindus and muslims are not just separate communities but separate nations, deserving their own nation states. it's an idea whose polar opposite is indian secularism, which sees hindus, muslims and everyone else co-existing together, with no state discrimination on account of religion.so why would pakistan be unhappy to see the rise of the bjp and the discrediting, indeed disavowal, of indian secularism?when an akhlaq is murdered on false beef rumours, pakistanis feel vindicated. when bjp leaders and ministers justify the incident - it was an accident, cow slaughter hurts sentiments, etc, - it proves for pakistanis the rationale of the two-nation theory. that without their own country, pakistanis would have been facing bans on cow meat, and getting lynched even if they were eating mutton.the rss-bjp's clear agenda is to make indian muslims second class citizens, one election at a time, which is exactly what jinnah said he feared, except he feared it from the congress!the hindu right likes to provoke neighbouring countries with the idea of a greater india, akhand bharat, but if you sit down and ask, they don't think partition was such a bad thing. partition reduced the proportion of muslim population vis-a-vis hindus, how could it be a bad thing?""narendra modi is the best thing that could have happened to pakistan,"" veteran pakistani journalist ayaz amir wrote recently. ""he is making india look like general zia's pakistan. can there be a bigger favour to pakistan than that?"" he asked.he writes what india looks like from pakistan these days: ""assaults on liberalism, threats to free speech, people killed because of their beliefs or what they stand for, hate and bigotry on the loose, extreme expressions of religiosity, indeed religion entering the political discourse like never before...these were things that were supposed to happen in pakistan.""""narendra modi is a godsend to pakistan. more power to hindutva,"" ayaz amir writes. amit shah should read his column to realise pakistanis would actually burst crackers not if the bjp loses bihar, but if it wins bihar.no matter who wins bihar, the falling depths of the bjp's communalised campaign have already made india lose some of its claim to moral superiority over pakistan.pakistanis won't need to wait till 8 november to say, in fahmida riaz's words:tum bilkul hum jaisey nikleyab tak kahaan chhupe thay bhai(you turned out to be just like uswhere were you hiding all this while).(shivam vij is a journalist in delhi.)disclaimer: the opinions expressed within this article are the personal opinions of the author. the facts and opinions appearing in the article do not reflect the views of ndtv and ndtv does not assume any responsibility or liability for the same.

2015-11-09,why congress is untrustworthy ally for liberals,"this was an opening statement in a panel discussion at the rajiv gandhi foundation's conference on republican values. the theme of the discussion was 'freedom'.this discussion on ""freedom"" has two contexts. one is the recent troubles in our country, the feeling that we are living through a time when our freedoms are challenged by an intolerant majoritarianism. this is a good time to reflect on the cardinal republican values: equality, democracy, secularism and freedom.the second context for this discussion is quite literally this conference's location: the rajiv gandhi foundation, an institution closely associated with the congress. taken together, these two contexts give me my theme. i want to examine the relationship of the republican congress with the freedoms guaranteed in our constitution.in this time of political crisis, when anxious citizens look for political allies to defend their freedoms, how likely are they to look to the congress? not very likely, because the congress in its decades in office helped create the legal and administrative apparatus that eroded our civil liberties. congress governments either pioneered illiberal laws or willingly built on oppressive precedents authored by others.take the example of cow-slaughter, if only because the lynching of mohammad aklaq created such moral revulsion. congressmen condemned the murder and denounced the bjp for its bigotry in its aftermath. but the historical record shows that it was congress governments in bihar, uttar pradesh, rajasthan and madhya pradesh that passed the first cow-protection acts. they didn't have to; directive principles aren't justiciable, but they chose to. it's these precedents that the bjp built upon when it legislated draconian punishments for cow-slaughter in states like haryana.the congress doesn't seem embarrassed by this record. last month mr digvijay singh claimed credit for it. ""out of 29 states,"", he said, ""cow slaughter is banned in 24 states and these bills were promulgated during congress rule."" he said this after the lynching of mohammad akhlaq. he challenged the bjp to draft an all-india bill which he said the congress would support. how does a party condemn hysterical mob violence over cow-slaughter one moment and press for a general ban the next? the bjp, for all its wickedness, stands for one side of this argument; the congress manages to stand for both.freedom of religion is a foundational republican value. several indian states have passed misleadingly named freedom of religion acts that were designed to curb the individual's freedom to convert, implicitly to islam and christianity. the first bills of this sort were passed in the late 60s by non-congress governments in madhya pradesh and orissa. after the congress regained power in these states, it made no effort to repeal them.when a party that fetishises secularism won't defend the freedom of an adult to choose his religious beliefs without government interference, what claim does it have to that value? in 2006, a congress government in himachal pradesh passed a freedom of religion bill on the same lines as the law passed that same year by narendra modi's gujarat government. we know the core issues that define the bjp; what does the congress stand for? how can it claim religious freedom as a defining principle if it won't expend political capital to defend it?the congress's record in the matter of defending civil liberties is dismal. all of us here remember the emergency as a nightmare of authoritarianism and unfreedom. we forget, though, that a state of continuous emergency prevails in large parts of our country thanks to afspa, the armed forces special powers act, passed by a congress government in 1958 and upheld by successive congress governments up to the present. indian citizens in kashmir and the north-east have no civil liberties that can't be abrogated at will, and no recourse. in ten years in office, the upa couldn't find the courage or conviction to repeal afspa. if the congress sees fundamental freedoms as a luxury that can be suspended in the name of national interest, how is it different from the bjp?nehru's words on freedom have a special resonance in delhi at this time of year. 31 years ago in this first week of november, sikhs in delhi had neither peace nor freedom nor even the right to life. that hideous pogrom and the congress's responsibility for it should haunt us all when we discuss abstract republican values in comfortable conference halls. if the congress wants to claim these values, it should stop treating indians like clients with needs and start treating them as free citizens with rights. the right to embody freedom can't be inherited from nehru; it has to be earned. mukul kesavan is a writer based in delhi. his most recent book is 'homeless on google earth' (permanent black, 2013).disclaimer: the opinions expressed within this article are the personal opinions of the author. the facts and opinions appearing in the article do not reflect the views of ndtv and ndtv does not assume any responsibility or liability for the same.",0.07083333333333333,congress untrustworthy ally liberals,"opening statement panel discussion rajiv gandhi foundation ' conference republican values. theme discussion ' freedom ' .this discussion "" freedom "" two contexts. one recent troubles country , feeling living time freedoms challenged intolerant majoritarianism. good time reflect cardinal republican values : equality , democracy , secularism freedom.the second context discussion quite literally conference ' location : rajiv gandhi foundation , institution closely associated congress. taken together , two contexts give theme. want examine relationship republican congress freedoms guaranteed constitution.in time political crisis , anxious citizens look political allies defend freedoms , likely look congress ? likely , congress decades office helped create legal administrative apparatus eroded civil liberties. congress governments either pioneered illiberal laws willingly built oppressive precedents authored others.take example cow-slaughter , lynching mohammad aklaq created moral revulsion. congressmen condemned murder denounced bjp bigotry aftermath. historical record shows congress governments bihar , uttar pradesh , rajasthan madhya pradesh passed first cow-protection acts.

2016-07-17,the atrocious charge of cow slaughter for akhlaq's family," it is not even a year since the brutal murder and public lynching of mohammad akhlaq on the night of september 28, 2015. there are no timelines for sorrow and grief. time does not heal, it may help to hone personal survival strategies for those who have to overcome the overwhelming loss of a beloved. but mohammad akhlaq's family is being denied even that chance. they are shattered with the news that they are now to be investigated on the charge of slaughtering a calf.up has a stringent law against cow slaughter. under section 3 of the uttar pradesh prevention of cow slaughter act, 1955, the slaughter of a cow, bull, bullock or its progeny is completely banned and penalty for violation, including an attempt to slaughter, is seven years of imprisonment. it is therefore a very serious matter with grave implications, given the political situation when under the present central regime, those who believe cow slaughter is justification for the death penalty adorn ministerial positions.akhlaq's family have expressed their willingness for a full investigation and in fact have demanded that it be completed speedily so that the truth can once again be reiterated.those who accuse them are the murderers of akhlaq. 17 of them, including sons of bjp leaders are in jail. the murder case is coming up for hearing on july 26 where charges are expected to be framed by a court. everything is being done by the accused and their supporters to weaken the case and get the charges changed. family members of akhlaq who are witnesses in the case are being threatened to withdraw.in a diabolical move prior to this crucial court hearing, a petition was filed in the local court demanding that an fir be registered against akhlaq's family members on grounds of violating the cow slaughter laws in uttar pradesh. the actual petitioner himself confesses that he is not an eyewitness; clearly he is the proxy for those in jail; yet the petition was accepted.in a total travesty of justice, a local court in sujapur ordered an investigation under section 156 (3) of the crpc on the basis of that petition. among those to be investigated is the slain man's daughter, a young woman named shaista. at the terrible time of her father's murder, we saw her, grief-stricken and asking the world, ""and when they find that the meat was that of a goat, will it bring my father back?"" today, she is accused along with her elderly mother, of holding the calf down while akhlaq's brother, who lives far from the village in town, is accused of actually wielding the knife and cutting the throat of the calf. other members of the family including a daughter-in-law, also living away in town, are all named as accomplices.the narration of events in the petition are so obviously fake and motivated. astonishingly it is claimed that the ""calf, adored by the whole village"" and ""fed milk and bread by the doting villagers"" was killed in broad daylight by akhlaq's family and at different stages, this was witnessed by three villagers, who have been named. this is supposed to have occurred on september 25, three days before akhlaq was killed. astonishingly, at the time of this supposed slaughter of their beloved calf, the eye witnesses remained silent - leave alone reporting it to the police, they kept it a closely-guarded secret even from the other villagers. why, one would ask? according to the petition, they were scared. of whom? no answers.but there is more of such drivel. the remains of the animal, according to the petition, were disposed of only three days later. the villagers, according to the petition, now busy looking for their revered missing calf, suddenly find akhlaq trying to dispose of a black plastic bag. no prizes for guessing that it contains the remains of none other than the missing calf. having been caught red-handed, not only does he confess, but he actually invites the villagers to his home to check the contents of the fridge which he says contains the rest of the meat. the angered villagers then beat him up.for communally-driven criminals capable of lynching, murdering a helpless, unarmed senior citizen, unable to defend himself, the manufacture of bizarre defence stories are to be expected. but should courts so easily permit what is clearly the blatant misuse of section 156(3)? this clause is meant to protect citizens' right to justice when the police refuse to act or investigate a complaint. under this clause, the magistrate is the deciding authority and does not require to hear anyone other than the complainant. but if the complaint itself is prima facie without any basis, why should it be entertained? here the petition itself is so full of contradictions, so clearly motivated to serve the purpose of intimidation of witnesses in an on-going murder case as also to influence the main case in which charges are to be framed, that it surely should have been dismissed. instead the police are ordered to investigate.but the police role too is highly questionable. instead of bringing on record the details of the investigation into the murder case which necessarily included investigation of the alleged motive, including cow slaughter, the police made no efforts whatsoever to convince the court that a fresh investigation was not required. it just produced a one-line written statement that no investigation had been conducted on cow slaughter. this provided the ground for the order.there is another side pointed out by the bright young lawyer representing the family, yunus saifi, who feels the petition may turn out to be a self-goal. he says that the petition actually admits to the killing of akhlaq and names specific people at the scene who should now be included as accused in the main case of murder. he and some members of the family are now targets of the merchants of hate who populate the sangh parivaar organisations in the area.at the time of akhlaq's death, rss and bjp leaders had justified the killing quoting the so-called vedic injunctions that the punishment for cow slaughter was death. now they want the judiciary to work on this understanding. the statements by bjp leaders welcoming the court order make it clear that they are fully with the murderers. in fact, it was sanjeev balyan, a minister in the modi government who said, ""akhlaq couldn't have eaten the full cow all alone. the meat would have gone to 20 families there. it's time to track them down and ensure justice is done to the other side"", the other side meaning those in jail.with the up elections as the immediate agenda, the sangh parivaar is back to doing what it knows best, the creation of communal polarization through spreading lies and hatred. this is a bigger battle against these forces which has to be fought and won, but in the meanwhile, the immediate concern is for the security and welfare of akhlaq's family. the country owes them. stand with them, stand by them, let them know they are not alone. this will also force the up government and administration to take the necessary urgent legal and administrative measure to ensure that justice is done and that they are protected from this vicious and inhuman onslaught.(brinda karat is a politburo member of the cpi(m) and a former member of the rajya sabha.)disclaimer: the opinions expressed within this article are the personal opinions of the author. the facts and opinions appearing in the article do not reflect the views of ndtv and ndtv does not assume any responsibility or liability for the same.",-0.025204136141636142,atrocious charge cow slaughter akhlaq ' family,"even year since brutal murder public lynching mohammad akhlaq night september 28 , 2015. timelines sorrow grief. time heal , may help hone personal survival strategies overcome overwhelming loss beloved. mohammad akhlaq ' family denied even chance. shattered news investigated charge slaughtering calf.up stringent law cow slaughter. section 3 uttar pradesh prevention cow slaughter act , 1955 , slaughter cow , bull , bullock progeny completely banned penalty violation , including attempt slaughter , seven years imprisonment. therefore serious matter grave implications , given political situation present central regime , believe cow slaughter justification death penalty adorn ministerial positions.akhlaq ' family expressed willingness full investigation fact demanded completed speedily truth reiterated.those accuse murderers akhlaq. 17 , including sons bjp leaders jail. murder case coming hearing july 26 charges expected framed court. everything done accused supporters weaken case get charges changed. family members akhlaq witnesses case threatened withdraw.in diabolical move prior crucial court hearing , petition filed local court demanding fir registered akhlaq ' family members grounds violating cow slaughter laws uttar pradesh. actual petitioner confesses eyewitness ; clearly proxy jail ; yet petition accepted.in total travesty justice , local court sujapur ordered investigation section 156 ( 3 ) crpc basis petition. among investigated slain man ' daughter , young woman named shaista. terrible time father ' murder , saw , grief-stricken asking world , "" find meat goat , bring father back ?

2017-05-29,modi government seeks to impose a food code on indians," the attempts to impose a food code on indians by the saffron brigade has now been taken forward by the central government in the form of an atrocious amendment to the rules under the prevention of cruelty to animals act. issued on may 25, on the eve of the celebrations of the completion of three years of the modi government, it symbolizes the irrational and warped priorities of this government.as has been widely reported, the notification number 396, called regulation on livestock rules 2017, imposes a ban on sale of cattle for slaughter all across india. cattle in this notification are defined as bulls, cows, bullocks, buffaloes, steers, heifers, calves and camels.what are the implications and consequences of this notification?the jurisdiction to decide on policies related to a ban on cattle slaughter lies with the state governments. it is for this reason that in january this year, a bench headed by the chief justice of the supreme court had stayed the order of the himachal pradesh high court which, through a judgement in 2016, had directed the central government to enact a national law against cow slaughter. the supreme court did not accept that the central government has the jurisdiction to do so. the case is still before the top court.however, the present notification by the central government circumvents the supreme court stay order. instead of a national ban on cow slaughter, it imposes a national ban on the sale of all cattle for slaughter. this includes the six states where there is no law at present against cow slaughter. if, for example, at a cattle fair in bengal or kerala, owners of cattle bring their cattle for sale and the buyer buys it for slaughter, the sale will be considered illegal according to the notification, even though there is no ban on slaughter of cows in these two states. secondly, no state has a ban on slaughter of buffaloes. but the notification will have the effect of a virtual ban. what other reason would there be to sell an unproductive buffalo, if not for slaughter? thus the notification is a direct encroachment on the rights of the states and on the federal structure of the constitution.the notification sets up a draconian system which not only criminalizes the cattle trade, but puts the burden of responsibility on the seller of cattle to ensure that the animal sold is used for agricultural purposes and not for slaughter. how could a farmer coming to sell his animal at a cattle fair be expected to know what the intentions of the buyer are? as far as the buyer is concerned, even if there are urgent reasons, he cannot sell the animal for at least six months. it is hypocritical that a regime claiming ""minimum government"" and putting an end to ""inspector raj"" should set up a highly bureaucratized maze where there is intense government scrutiny on the sale and purchase of animals. the thought of inspectors snooping outside the cowshed would be laughable, had it not had such serious consequences for farmers who will be vulnerable to harassment and corruption.at a time when there is rampant goondaism in the name of cow protection, this notification will act as a shot in the arm for cow vigilante groups. now in the name of prevention of cruelty to animals, they will have a license to terrorize. the notification is also going to result in a serious loss of livelihood for millions of cattle traders and dairy farmers.over the years, as far as milch cattle are concerned, there has been a shift in preference to keeping buffaloes rather than cows. it is interesting to note that the states with the most stringent anti-cow slaughter laws are precisely those which have seen a shift in preference for the buffalo. for example, take the states of haryana or even gujarat. here, milk production from buffaloes is far higher than that from cows, reflecting the shift in preference in the animals that farmers keep. it is in these states that the number of stray cows is far higher, uncared for and turned out by their owners. on the other hand, in both bengal and kerala, the production of milk from cows is far higher than that of buffaloes. the number of stray cows is also far less.the ministry of animal husbandry, which also conducts a cattle census every five years, has a detailed statistical profile of the bovine population on its website which provides the explanation for such a shift. according to its estimates, indigenous cows, the original gau mata, produce on an average 2.5 kgs of milk a day. the exotic/cross breed variety produces 7.15 kgs, but its cost and upkeep is very high. the female buffalo produces 5.15 kgs of milk on an average. in this case, economics trumps other considerations, and therefore, there has been a shift in the preference of most dairy farmers to the female buffalo over the gau mata. moreover, once the buffalo gets dry, it is sold easily for slaughter.googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display(""adslotnativevideo""); });however, notification 396 now criminalises trade in buffaloes too. thus all those farmers who had shifted to keeping buffaloes will find it difficult to sell the animal. this has long-term implications for the dairy industry.farmers in india are already in considerable distress. in the last three years, farm suicides have gone up to over 36,000, making it an average of 32 suicides every day. with the government reneging on its promise of implementing the recommendations of the swaminathan commission, agriculture for the majority of kisans is a loss-making enterprise. the swaminathan commission had recommended a minimum profit over and above the cost of production to be the basis for fixing a remunerative procurement price for agricultural produce. without such a backup, animal husbandry and trade in cattle is an important alternative source of income for kisans. as it is, the stringent laws against cattle slaughter, which includes even bulls in most states, has led to a steep fall in the prices of cattle. it costs a farmer a minimum of 35,000 to 40,000 rupees a year, excluding the cost of family labour, mainly that of women, to care for a single animal. if the animal cannot be sold for slaughter after it becomes unproductive, the farmer will have to bear the entire burden.along with farmers, those involved with the export of beef, mainly buffalo meat valued at 30,000 crore rupees, will take a huge hit. lakhs of meat shop owners will also be affected. the entire chain of the leather industry, also worth thousands of crores of rupees and providing jobs to around 2.5 million people, will be further affected.there is also the impact such regulation will have on nutrition. it is commonly thought that it is only minority communities who eat beef. but the nsso shows that there are substantial numbers among the majority hindu population who eat beef. for poorer sections of the population, it is a cheaper source of nutrition which will now be stopped. this at a time when india has unacceptably high levels of malnutrition and anaemia.those who use grounds of religious belief and sentiment to justify the imposition of a food code against the consumption of beef have always sought to hide the reality that in india, in any case, it is mainly buffalo meat that is consumed and that the definition of beef includes buffalo meat. in the frenzied campaign of the bhakts, where man slaughter is justified against cow slaughter, facts are always concealed. the website of the ministry shows that the number of slaughtered cattle (bulls and cows) is just 1.6 per cent of the cattle population. the percentage of buffaloes slaughtered is 10.2 per cent of the total numbers of buffaloes. this shows the utter falsity of the hate campaign that is terrorizing minority communities and is leading to the destruction of the livelihood of millions of people across caste and creed.the kerala government has taken the lead in opposing the notification. the central government should withdraw it.brinda karat is a politburo member of the cpi(m) and a former member of the

2018-09-28,"opinion: ""will you remain silent?"" - akhlaq's daughter on his 3rd death anniversary","on this day, september 28, three years ago, mohammad akhlaq, a resident of the bisada village in the dadri area of western uttar pradesh, was brutally killed in his own home by a mob of men on the accusation of cow slaughter. his younger son danish was grievously injured. his mother was also badly hurt. three years after this horrific killing and violence, charges have not yet been framed by the court, all the 18 main accused in his killing are out on bail, his home is locked up, his family have had to leave the village. instead of getting justice, his family, including his teen daughter shaista have to contend with a false case of cow slaughter foisted on them by a an individual linked to the murderers. the complaint which should have been outright rejected by the lower court, was admitted, and a police investigation ordered. this hangs like a sword over them, ever threatening. even while their grief and trauma was raw and hurting, they had to go through the tense process of getting anticipatory bail.akhlaq's murder was the first in the type of lynchings which have become the hallmark of the modi regime. a report by indiaspend has collated data which shows that between 2014 when modi took office and march 2018, there have been 80 incidents of violent mob attacks in which 45 persons have been killed. there is no official record of cases of hate crime because there is no separate law for it. but the contours of akhlaq's case are important to know as different dimensions of his murder are being repeated in case after case.a mob had killed mohammad akhlaq and brutally beat up his son danish in september 2015akhlaq, like most of those who have been similarly lynched after him, lived a life far removed from violence. there is no record of any dispute, leave alone a clash between him and his neighbours, all of whom testify to him being a peace-loving man who lived a quiet life with his family. there was not even a remote connection between the way he lived his life and his terrible violent death. this is true of almost all the victims of crimes committed in the name of the cow. there was nothing in their lives which represented enmity or violence. even if one went by the grossly erroneous justification that the killing was a reflection of spontaneous anger against cow slaughter, in not a single case has there been actual evidence of such slaughter. the killings are political killings as they have been committed to further a specific political agenda of communal polarization and hate.the lynchers in akhlaq's case used the local temple to announce their manufactured lie. according to the statement the priest gave to the police, four young men, whom he identified and named, forced him to make an announcement that a cow had been slaughtered and its remains were lying in a drain near a transformer at the side of the village where akhlaq's house stood. the call was that every hindu should come out of their homes to defend the gau mata and their religion. these highly provocative statements were given from a supposed place of worship. those who claim to be representing the interests of hindus have no compunction in using centres of worship as centres of crime. there are numerous examples as to how communal violence gets fanned through provocative hate language from places of worship. yet the law has no provision against such misuse of places of worship.there was nothing spontaneous about the lynching. bisada village had escaped any kind of communal violence, even during the violence which rocked the state of uttar pradesh after the demolition of the babri masjid in 1992. akhlaq's family members spoke of the close ties that had developed over the years across religious communities among their neighbours. during festive occasions, including eid, food was sent from one house to another. shaista used to go to the local school facing no problems. but things started changing in the period before the 2014 elections, with the aggressive communal campaign of the sangh parivar.family members of mohammad akhlaq, who was lynched by a mob in dadri over allegations of consuming and storing beefat the state level, the government was then run by the samajwadi party. in this area of the state, the bjp gave lok sabha tickets to known communal elements, including those who were accused in the terrible muzaffarnagar communal violence. after their victory, they were further emboldened. the first half of 2015 saw highly provocative campaigns. in march, the akhil bharatiya pratinidhi sabha of the rss had given a call for national campaigns against so-called love jihad and against cow slaughter, and this was implemented with a vengeance in up. the magazine frontline reported that ""according to senior officials in the uttar pradesh administration, there have been close to a hundred minor and major assault cases over alleged cow slaughter.""the planned campaign of the sangh parivar to target minorities on the issue of cow slaughter was reflected in the village too. local bjp leaders led the campaign with provocative slogans and actions. on that terrible day, the ring leaders who committed the crime were known to be linked with the ruling party. the son of a local bjp leader was one of the first to be identified and arrested.top bjp leaders made the most offensive statements justifying the crime. the mp of the area and minister of state in the bjp government termed it ""an accident""; another described it as ""a mistake committed by children""; the vice president of the state unit declared that a mahapanchayat was being called to protest against the harassment of hindus; a then rajya sabha member tweeted ""why should the responsibility to keep peace be on the hindu community""? and through all this the prime minister did not say a word. it took ten days and only after a strong statement by the then president pranab mukherjee for him to criticize the violence - and that too, only obliquely. the involvement of the sangh parivar through gau rakshak committees, and the defence of their criminal activities of harassing, bullying, intimidating and also the killing of muslims with senior leaders of the bjp directly helping the accused in cases like akhlaq, have now become commonplace. if jayant sinha can garland the killers of alimuddin ansari who was lynched in a similar case in jharkhand, it is because he knows that this is acceptable to the leadership of his party. his ministerial colleague mahesh sharma had wrapped the body of one of the accused in the akhlaq murder case in the national flag after he died of an illness in jail. political patronage to the alleged killers has been a critical factor in the subversion of justice in the akhlaq case and all the others that followed.union minister jayant sinha with the men who killed a meat trader on suspicion of carrying beefjust four days ago, the supreme court directed the government to implement the slew of orders it passed in july on a public interest litigation or pil against cow vigilantism. the court had said that people should know that they would invite the ""wrath of the law"" on themselves after such incidents.googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display(""adslotnativevideo""); });the wrath of the law should first be faced by the modi government. it is responsible for non-compliance with the orders of the court. although the government set up a committee under the home ministry to implement the orders, nothing substantial has been done. most importantly, the court orders to consider a separate law for cases of mob lynching has not been implemented by the committee. nor has the government made any move to implement the order to set up fast-track courts for all such cases.meanwhile, it is the benevolence of the flawed judicial process that is being extended to the killers in mob-lynching incidents. sartaj (l), the elder son of mohammad akhlaq who is a corporal with the indian air forcein not a single case have any of the accused been punished. in the one case of alimuddin ansari where the lower court had found the accused guilty and sentenced them, the high court came to their rescue, acquitting some and allowing bail to the others. in almost every other case, the accused are out on bail. in akhlaq's case, every trick in the book has been used to ensure that even the charges have not been filed. the lawyer in the akhlaq case, yusuf saifi, has received threats to give up the case. the security protection given to him has been withdrawn by the present uttar pradesh government. a key witness, the local priest, has been declared as untraceable by the police. it is a shameful travesty of justice.three years after the murder, the family of akhlaq are without their home; akhlaq's eldest son, employed in the defence services, is now looking after them along with his own wife and children. their mother is unwell and is being medically treated, they need help to rebuild their lives, danish needs a job, shaista needs assistance to finish her higher secondary exams so that she can follow her wish to study fashion designing. their spirit remains unbroken. yesterday the two siblings joined a solidarity dharna organized by the all india democratic women's association at jantar mantar. speaking to the assembled crowd, shaista said, ""they took my abu from me, but am i expected to remain silent? should you remain silent? it was my abu they killed three years ago, tomorrow it could be anyone's. once humanity is lost, nothing can remain.i believe in justice and that is why i am here to fight for it.""brave words from a brave daughter. but are we

accused are out on bail. in akhlaq's case, every trick in the book has been used to ensure that even the charges have not been filed. the lawyer in the akhlaq case, yusuf saifi, has received threats to give up the case. the security protection given to him has been withdrawn by the present uttar pradesh government. a key witness, the local priest, has been declared as untraceable by the police. it is a shameful travesty of justice.three years after the murder, the family of akhlaq are without their home; akhlaq's eldest son, employed in the defence services, is now looking after them along with his own wife and children. their mother is unwell and is being medically treated, they need help to rebuild their lives, danish needs a job, shaista needs assistance to finish her higher secondary exams so that she can follow her wish to study fashion designing. their spirit remains unbroken. yesterday the two siblings joined a solidarity dharna organized by the all india democratic women's association at jantar mantar. speaking to the assembled crowd, shaista said, ""they took my abu from me, but am i expected to remain silent? should you remain silent? it was my abu they killed three years ago, tomorrow it could be anyone's. once humanity is lost, nothing can remain.i believe in justice and that is why i am here to fight for it.""brave words from a brave daughter. but are we
