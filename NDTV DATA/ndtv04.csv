2014-10-03,it'll take more than politicians with jhadoos,"(siddharth varadarajan is a senior fellow at the centre for public affairs and critical theory, shiv nadar university) make no mistake, swachh bharat is a laudable goal and the prime minister has done well to make it a priority. even if the compulsory pledging added a goofy touch to the abhiyan, making the ordinary citizen conscious of her or his role in ensuring a clean india is surely a good thing.that said, the harsh reality must also be recognised: that the anti-litter campaign being hard-sold as the central part of the 'swachh bharat' operation will do nothing to clean up the squalor that the majority of indians live with thanks to decades of official neglect, inaction and callousness. indeed, for the hundreds of millions who live without proper access to running water (forget about its potability) and a sewerage system - two necessary conditions for basic sanitation in urban areas and as well as the countryside - the idea that the cosmetic wielding of brooms by volunteers for two hours a week will provide cleaner and healthier living conditions is a cruel joke.let us be honest in recognizing the problem of cleanliness at the outset. urban litter - the target of choice for most politicians who have wielded the broom as part of the campaign - is actually the least of the problems from an urban sanitation point of view. yes, litter and trash look unsightly, but - like the green screens the gujarat government erected to keep ahmedabad's slums out of xi jinping's during his recent visit to the city - it is also easy to find a cosmetic solution for it. the real challenge begins when litter and trash are all swept up and have nowhere to go because few indian cities or towns have invested in proper garbage collection and disposal systems. the problem with the way in which the swachh bharat campaign has started is that voluntarism is not being deployed or encouraged where it would be most effective - at the household level, where trash must be minimized, recycled and segregated. instead, individual action is being sought where there is actually need for organized collective action by a state or municipal body in the collection and proper disposal of garbage. disposal itself poses a huge problem because existing landfills are poorly located and designed and are already bursting at the seams. with india's urban population set to grow at a rapid rate, modi's campaign could simply end up relocating the problem of filth to backyards elsewhere unless the endpoint of the process is not worked upon with great urgency.googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display(""adslotnativevideo""); });in his 1937 paper 'the fantasy of dirt', lawrence kubie may have been right in berating human society for treating 'soft' and 'wet' dirt as more 'dirty' than dirt that is 'hard' and 'dry'. it is, therefore, easier to get volunteers to sweep someone else's dry trash than wash their dishes or toilets, something a gandhi could do but not any modern day politician. and yet, sewage treatment and disposal is surely the single biggest sanitary challenge of our times. a public campaign can make people change their behaviour but it cannot alter or stop the metronomic rhythm of bodily functions. we can stop chucking garbage on the street or using plastic but the call of nature will always have to be answered. because politicians never cared to plan for the urban poor, crores of families in towns and cities across india live beside open drains, with few toilets and no running source of water to clean themselves or their environs. where sanitation pipelines exist, the raw sewage that flows through them usually ends up being dumped untreated into rivers and water bodies. in rural and rurban india, the problem is equally acute if less visible. while both the modi government and the manmohan singh government it replaced have spoken of the need to end the practice of open defecation, it should be obvious that the binding constraint is not necessarily access to toilets, but water and a system for disposing of fecal matter. in the absence of the latter two, those toilets that exist often go unused or add to the cleaning burden of women or dalit workers. there is talk of waterless toilets but designing and producing them on the scale required will surely require state intervention. here, modi must move beyond spectacle to substance, and address the mismatch between his government's promise of sanitation for all by 2019 and the meager increase in funds provided by finance minister arun jaitley. all his first budget offered was a mere six crore rupees increase over the previous budgetary allocation of rs 15,260.70 crore. as long as the prime minister doesn't put the exchequer's money where his mouth is, a 'swachh bharat' will remain out of reach for india's poor, even if high-profile public spaces are spotless.put simply, a clean india will require modern sewerage in urban areas and piped water for every rural and urban settlement. without this infrastructure, the mass sweeping of streets every few weeks or the opening of toilet blocks will accomplish little. a clean india also needs a professional system of garbage collection and disposal. this system need not be centralized, and may be more effective if run at the neighborhood or ward level. in the longer term, it requires not the chimera of new 'smart cities' but the retrofitting of existing cities with proper masterplans.it should be obvious that any modern system of urban sanitation requires professional workers with proper pay, entitlements and equipment, not the haphazard use of underpaid staff working under contract in unsafe or unsanitary conditions. in this context, is worth asking whether modi or his advisors paused to think about the symbolism of launching the clean india campaign from the valmiki colony in new delhi. sure, gandhiji stayed there awhile during the freedom struggle and the mahatma encouraged everyone to help make their environment clean, but his messaging was primarily aimed at those in the caste hierarchy who believed in untouchability. by starting the swachh bharat abhiyan from a basti of valmikis, who have been locked into the occupation of cleaning by the caste system despite 67 years of democracy, what message was modi trying to convey? that the valmikis are the designated cleaners of india? that the valmikis are the ones who need a prime ministerial lesson in cleanliness the most? if the purpose was to dignify the labour of sanitation workers, the pm should have made concrete commitments to improve their working conditions.does modi have the will to see the through the kind of reforms a clean india really needs? so far, there is little evidence to suggest he even recognizes their importance. that is why the performative aspect of the swachh bharat abhiyan was so important. apart from the immediate mileage the prime minister himself derives by picking up a jhadoo for a few minutes, the voluntarist message he gave also serves a longer-term political purpose. by the time the next election comes around and most indians find themselves without the promised sanitation and clean environment, they will be told to look inward and ask themselves why they failed. rather than pointing their finger at the prime minister.disclaimer: the opinions expressed within this article are the personal opinions of the author. ndtv is not responsible for the accuracy, completeness, suitability, or validity of any

for all his wisdom, mr aiyar himself failed to make a success of the jan kerosene pariyojana which he launched with much fanfare on 2nd october 2005 as the union petroleum minister. the objective of the jan kerosene pariyojana scheme was to effectively distribute kerosene to end consumers and prevent diversion of the fuel. it also sought to involve panchayati raj institutions in monitoring of the scheme. the scheme was hardly a trailblazing success, and within three years, the government was forced to consider dumping it altogether. obviously it takes much more to deliver than to criticize. but even that experience has not mattered after all for mr aiyar and his ilk. googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display(""adslotnativevideo""); });compare this with the pradhan mantri jan dhan yojana (pmjdy). if enabling the access of banking services to the marginalised was a professed goal for the nationalisation of banks in the early 1970s, what prevented the congress from achieving this over the next four decades?

2014-10-09,pm's references to indira and nehru,"(ashok malik is a columnist and writer living in delhi)at a public meeting recently, prime minister narendra modi asked people to devote the week between jawaharlal nehru's birthday (november 14) and indira gandhi's birthday (november 19) to extending the swachh bharat campaign to primary schools and anganwadis. this has led to some speculation in the media that modi, having appropriated vallabhbhai patel and madan mohan malviya, among other congress stalwarts, is now ready to claim a slice of the legacy of nehru and indira. is this a fair and realistic assessment - or is it journalistic imagination? before answering that question, it is important to point out that there is no uniformity to the history or legacy of the congress. it all depends on which congress one is talking about.as an institution, the indian national congress is 129 years old. its life can be divided into three near-equal segments:between 1885 and about 1920, the pre-gandhi period, it was a collective of the early elites of modern indiabetween the 1920s and the mid to late 1960s, it was the pan-indian movement that gandhi put together, and which had something for almost every indianafter 1969, the indira gandhi period, it became just another political party and faction - albeit the largest one - in a competitive and partisan electoral environment.the bjp's quarrel is largely with that third incarnation of the congress. of course this is not to suggest there are no differences with earlier avatars of the congress, or with congress governments before indira gandhi. take nehru for example. the sangh family blames him for not pushing a uniform civil code in the first years of independence, when it was politically feasible to institute such a code. it also charges him, justifiably, with mishandling and misunderstanding the kashmir problem as well as the challenge from china in tibet and beyond.googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display(""adslotnativevideo""); });having said that, nehru was not without his achievements. he presided over a foundational and formative period in indian history, and the task before modi at the dawn of the 21st century, with a young and hungry population, is comparable. nehru's strategic project of building heavy industry in india and his considerable public investments in higher education are certainly something one can see a modi replicate. of course, modi's policies will have far more room for the private sector and for indian enterprise.the supposed appropriation of indira is much more problematic. just what is there to appropriate, other than the determined leadership in 1971, the year of the bangladesh war? indeed modi's campaign in 2014 was virtually a repudiation of indira raj and indira's legacy. her dismantling of public institutions and packing of the bureaucracy and even the judiciary with favourites; her weakening of the federal balance by crushing the autonomy of state governments; her treatment of political opponents as enemies; her promotion of cronyism, self-defeating nationalisation and licence-permit toxicity; her paranoiac personality that left india rattled and in constant turmoil; her hostility to key countries that isolated india in south asia; her feckless instigation of violence, whether in punjab or sri lanka, to hurt political opponents: so much that the upa government did and defended had its roots in the indira period. even the coal scandal can be traced back to her policies.in many senses the nation and the society we have to rebuild - and whether modi does it or a later prime minister is for posterity to judge - is the nation and the society indira gandhi ruined.as such, the so-called appropriation of nehru and indira, especially of the latter, needs to be considered with sobriety. modi has simply used two dates that the congress is hyper-sensitive about to further his national cleanliness campaign. he has attempted to at once invite the congress to take part in the campaign, and provoke it into appearing churlish should it stay away. beyond that, one cannot really see an appropriation. disclaimer: the opinions expressed within this article are the personal opinions of the author. ndtv is not responsible for the accuracy, completeness, suitability, or validity of any information on this article. all information is provided on an as-is basis. the information, facts or opinions appearing in the article do not reflect the views of ndtv and ndtv does not assume any responsibility or liability for the same.",0.10274034141958673,pm ' references indira nehru,"( ashok malik columnist writer living delhi ) public meeting recently , prime minister narendra modi asked people devote week jawaharlal nehru ' birthday ( november 14 ) indira gandhi ' birthday ( november 19 ) extending swachh bharat campaign primary schools anganwadis. led speculation media modi , appropriated vallabhbhai patel madan mohan malviya , among congress stalwarts , ready claim slice legacy nehru indira. fair realistic assessment - journalistic imagination ?

2014-10-16,"bjp, swachh politics is what's needed","(brinda karat is a politburo member of the cpi(m) and a former member of the rajya sabha.)the voter has voted. whatever the results, one thing is for sure - the maharashtra election campaign and related issues show that unless parliament wakes up to the urgent need for electoral reforms, it's sunset time for indian democracy.the need for proportional representation, state funding, an end to corporate money in elections, and setting limits for expenditures of political parties are just some of the urgently required reforms thrown up so clearly in the experience of the maharashtra elections.this of course would require an initiative from the ruling party. the congress showed no interest for nearly a decade. whether the bjp will is to be seen. the maharashtra experience shows that there is little difference among the main contenders as far as the injection of a toxin of the multiple cs into the body politic in maharashtra is concerned - corruption, cash, criminals, caste and communalism. if all this did not become an important poll issue, it is because all four major contenders were pretty much equally guilty in spreading the toxins around, though in differing degrees. let's look at the aspect of cash and criminals.nitin gadkari, a central minister and the former president of the bjp, was charged by the election commission for his outrageous remarks in an election rally. in a public meeting in the latur district on october 5, gadkari said ""in the next 10 days all of you will have in your stars the chance of laxmi darshan. do not kick away the laxmi (wealth) that will come to you. . . there will be foreign liquor for the special leaders and country liquor for the petty leaders. eat what you want, drink what you want and keep what you get!"" forget ethics. this is a clear violation of the election code of conduct. it constitutes a corrupt practice but gadkari got away with a reprimand. when a central minister speaks this language, what is the hope of cleansing indian politics? these were not just empty words.the official figures of cash and liquor intercepted by the police in maharashtra three days before the elections are of around rs 16 crore in cash. the nodal officer in pune reported that the unaccounted-for cash seized by his team was over rs 24 crore. according to the director of enforcement of the state excise department, the liquor seized was 15.81 lakh litres. the raids that brought out liquor were indeed according to the declared menu of nitin gadkari from foreign liquor to toddy. but this is a highly underestimated amount, just a fraction of the actual amounts spent by leaders to bribe the voter. regretfully, corruption has become so all pervasive that there are few to report it. googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display(""adslotnativevideo""); });it is true that cash-for-votes is nothing new but the sheer scale of it today is enough to completely distort and subvert a free and fair election. when the prime minister is setting the pace, one would expect that the old corrupt ways of the congress-ncp combine in winning elections would have been replaced with a swachh politics campaign. but nitin gadkari would have put everyone straight on that expectation. there was not a word from narendra modi in all his 27 rallies against the use of money power to buy votes. it is obvious why.maharashtra also showed the completely unequal, non-level playing field for different contestants. one of the instruments which help national parties to ""legally"" cross the expenditure barrier is the concept of ""star campaigners."" national parties or state-level recognized parties get to appoint a list of around 30-40 star campaigners. the expenditure of these campaigners, like hiring of helicopters, private planes etc. are not counted in the accounts of the candidates they are campaigning for, which gives an advantage to the candidate who has the richest leader. worst of all, the hundreds of crores spent in advertisements, hoardings, television ads, mobile vans projecting a national leader is not calculated as poll expenditure at all. it is attributed to the expenditure of the political party for which there is currently no limit. so whether the expenditure on modi's campaign is rs 200 crore as alleged by raj thackeray or rs 2,000 crore, it is all the same as far as election rules are concerned.a direct impact of this dominance of money is in the profile of candidates. we are fast getting to a stage when only the really rich can successfully contest elections in most states where the major mainstream national parties dominate. in this election, the richest candidate with declared wealth of rs 353.53 crore was from the bjp; so was the second-richest with rs 200 crore. the poorest was a cpi(m) candidate with rs 15,000. a large majority of candidates, 236 from the four main parties are crorepatis several times over. maharashtra is fifth on the list as far as per capita income is concerned, but still the gap between the earnings of ordinary folk and their representatives gets wider every election. this is more like corporatocracy than democracy.it is also a sobering thought that the larger-than-life created image of the prime minister acted as a shield to push away from public scrutiny the more murky aspect of the choice of candidates. 60 of the bjp's candidates were leaders from other parties. among them was a candidate accused of the murder of two north indians when raj thackeray was arrested in 2008; another is a man who spent four years in jail as an accused in the multi-crore telgi scam; yet another a man who was booked for spreading communal hatred. according to maharashtra election watch, the bjp has one-third of all candidates who are accused in cases of serious crimes such as murder, rape, crimes against women, dacoits, robbery. the mns has 42 per cent, shiv sena 41 per cent and the ncp and congress have 29 and 20 per cent respectively.india's parliamentary democracy is already subverted in umpteen ways. now we have a winner-takes-it-all philosophy on display, when anything and everything goes as long as you win.disclaimer: the opinions expressed within this article are the personal opinions of the author. ndtv is not responsible for the accuracy, completeness, suitability, or validity of any information on this article. all information is provided on an as-is basis. the information, facts or opinions appearing in the article do not reflect the views of ndtv and ndtv does not assume any responsibility or liability for the same.",0.037750999000999,"bjp , swachh politics ' needed","( brinda karat politburo member cpi( ) former member rajya sabha. ) voter voted. whatever results , one thing sure - maharashtra election campaign related issues show unless parliament wakes urgent need electoral reforms , ' sunset time indian democracy.the need proportional representation , state funding , end corporate money elections , setting limits expenditures political parties urgently required reforms thrown clearly experience maharashtra elections.this course would require initiative ruling party. congress showed interest nearly decade. whether bjp seen. maharashtra experience shows little difference among main contenders far injection toxin multiple cs body politic maharashtra concerned - corruption , cash , criminals , caste communalism. become important poll issue , four major contenders pretty much equally guilty spreading toxins around , though differing degrees. let ' look aspect cash criminals.nitin gadkari , central minister former president bjp , charged election commission outrageous remarks election rally. public meeting latur district october 5 , gadkari said "" next 10 days stars chance laxmi darshan. kick away laxmi ( wealth ) come you. . . foreign liquor special leaders country liquor petty leaders. eat want , drink want keep get !

});even more important, i have stressed from the very beginning that i don't believe in photo-ops, and that i am not interested in an exercise that involves a few prominent vips wielding a broom for five minutes and never touching one again till the next gandhi jayanti. so while doing a thorough cleaning of a filthy beach - which entailed my personally clearing plastic, paper waste, assorted debris and even a dead rat - i also announced the donation of a bio-gas plant to vizhinjam ward, which would process a tonne of waste a day and give the local residents another place to bring their garbage, rather than to throw it on the beach. long-term waste management plans are vital to take the idea of a clean india beyond photo ops.nor did i discover the environment only through mr modi's aegis. i have been writing and speaking about it since my united nations days. in fact, one of my essays, first published in 2005, about the lack of civic responsibility for public cleanliness in our culture (""the bond that threatens""), has been included in kerala's high school english textbooks since 2008. no one is going to argue convincingly that participating in a cleanliness drive is inconsistent in any way with my long held and publicly-expressed beliefs. swachh, to me, doesn't involve any switch.at the same time, in uploading a video of the drive and its results, i called upon the prime minister to take his idea of ""swachh bharat"" beyond broom-wielding to the large-scale, challenging and expensive projects that require central government resources to execute. in my constituency flowed the parvathy puthenaar canal, once the lifeblood of the city; boats used to ply on it, people drank its water, kids swam in it. today it is an open sewer, choked with garbage and muck, as the sewage from houses on both sides flows into the canal and locals toss their waste into it. a serious project for its revival will require not merely the huge task of cleaning out the filth, but the construction of alternative underground sewage systems for the residents on either side of the canal, and the injection of fresh water to flush out the canal and restore it to being a living water body. this would cost hundreds of crores, but it would be an extraordinary transformation that makes the idea of swachh bharat a reality for lakhs of people in thiruvananthapuram. having called upon the local mp to do his bit, i think it's fair to ask: is the prime minister now prepared to do his?disclaimer: the opinions expressed within this article are the personal opinions of the author. ndtv is not responsible for the accuracy, completeness, suitability, or validity of any information on this article. all information is provided on an as-is basis. the information, facts or opinions appearing in the article do not reflect the views of ndtv and ndtv does not assume any responsibility or liability for the same.",0.041175706646294885,"' bit , modi ji. ?","( dr. shashi tharoor two-time mp thiruvananthapuram , chairman parliamentary standing committee external affairs , former union minister state external affairs human resource development former un under-secretary-general. written 14 books , including , recently , pax indica : india world 21st century. ) rarely much media fuss made something minor chorus greeted cleaning , saturday , beach vizhinjam constituency , thiruvananthapuram. amid noise ' hearing , simple clarifications seem order.as ' repeatedly pointed , ' see political exercise bjp , national mission - first prioritized mahatma gandhi , instituted jawaharlal nehru pursued , different names , every government since - given new impetus visibility prime minister india , narendra modi. invited , without prior warning , support effort , felt obvious accept. media described climbing aboard modi bandwagon , see action patriotic indian citizen responding call duty nation.i bit dismayed see actions portrayed political naif "" duped "" "" publicity stunt "" . various distinguished indians , including rajya sabha member national icon nominated party , congress chief minister well others , done bit cleaning. merely complicit canny politician ' publicity stunt , see providing useful service setting example fellow indians?strikingly , joined cleaning local congress councillor , political leadership congress party area ( including "" mandalam president "" "" block president "" ) , large number local residents youth , well president secretary local jama ' ath ( area predominantly muslim ) . last people play along purely bjp-driven political exercise. local residents wake dirt waste around , stake cleanliness area , publicity stunt.vizhinjam beautiful area arabian sea , blessed nature. poet wrote , "" every prospect pleases , man [ man ' waste ] vile.

not unexpectedly, countless congress spokespersons were clueless. in a piquant position, they preferred to lecture the nation on the benefits of secularism and nehruvian ideology rather than providing a cogent answer that could even remotely answer their leader's irreverent comment.mr. rahul gandhi's use of the term ""photo opportunity"" is, in itself, fascinating - ironically coming from one whose entire political existence appears to be a string of carefully planned events crafted as near perfect photo opportunities. whether it was the travel in local trains of mumbai, or spending a night at the house of a dalit family in a village; or angrily tearing an ordinance issued by the upa government to protect convicted politicians; or the visit to bhatta parsaul village riding pillion on a motorcycle; every event achieved nothing beyond a photo session combined with sound-bytes that essentially reminded the nation of mr. gandhi's political existence and supposed concerns.in his outburst, mr. gandhi also expected a billion plus people to believe that a country which won its independence on the principle of love and non-violence was today ""being ruled by people who are angry"" and further in his assessment, ""spreading poison"". obviously this profound comment was to be appreciated, perhaps even applauded, by citizens who experienced runaway inflation, corruption and a lack of governance for years under the erstwhile congress-upa government. mr. gandhi seems oblivious to the fact, that in a few months of mr. modi's government taking charge, over 70 million marginalised, poor citizens have opened bank accounts owing to the implementation of the pradhan mantri jan dhan yojana, among several other large initiatives. googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display(""adslotnativevideo""); });it is also amusing to note, that following prime minister modi's announcement, students across schools in india are to observe the entire week cleaning their school and surroundings between the birth anniversaries of jawaharlal nehru on the 14thand indira gandhi on 19th november, occasions that accord respect to mr. rahul gandhi's maternal great grandfather and grandmother. are these not examples of good governance that should be celebrated by every indian irrespective of political affiliation? how are these, even remotely, examples of spreading poison? should not a government, young in tenure, be supported for causes that benefit the country and its citizens en masse? such concerns, one might suppose, would appeal to those who value and respect work and accomplishment. beyond the inherited goodwill of prime ministers jawaharlal nehru, indira gandhi and rajiv gandhi, what might mr. rahul gandhi lay claim to? could he showcase efforts he might have made instead of relying on a preferential existence founded on an inherited legacy? in over a decade as member of parliament, mr. gandhi's attendance in sessions has been far from exemplary; his participation in debates virtually non-existent. he seems to lack a sustained interest in the responsibility so fondly meted out to him by his constituency and by others who, at some point, regarded him as a possible future leader.perhaps that explains the urgency to hold onto a legacy of the past with such desperation. take the political inheritance away and mr. rahul gandhi would be the dimpled boy of his more politically astute mum. unfortunately, that's all he has been living by, at least so far.disclaimer: the opinions expressed within this article are the personal opinions of the author. ndtv is not responsible for the accuracy, completeness, suitability, or validity of any information on this article. all information is provided on an as-is basis. the information, facts or opinions appearing in the article do not reflect the views of ndtv and ndtv does not assume any responsibility or liability for the same.",0.08289170506912442,"really , rahul ?

2015-05-18,"truth vs hype: crores of swachh bharat toilets, but where are the users?","lucknow: at parvar purab village, an hour from uttar pradesh's capital lucknow, newly-built toilets dot the front yards of modest homes. on them are brightly painted slogans - 'swachh rahenge, swasth rahenge (stay clean, stay healthy)' and 'bahu betiya dur na jaye, ghar mein shauchalay banvaye (so your daughters don't have to go far, build toilets in homes)'.residents tell us they were all built just a month or two ago.across india, toilets like these are springing up under the nda's swachh bharat mission, an ambitious scaling up of the upa's nirmal bharat abhiyan, which claimed to have built 1 crore toilets in two years. the swachh bharat mission hopes to increase that tenfold: building 11 crore toilets in five years, at the rate of one toilet every second.but nirmal bharat faltered: on paper, it was meant to be demand-driven, which means toilets are only built if people ask for them. in october last year, when we visited villages in up's sitapur district, we found, in village after village, that toilets built by the local pradhan or district administration. no one had consulted villagers on the location, design or operation of the toilet. no one had briefed them on the health risks of open defecation. as a result, most of the toilets were unused - some turned to store rooms for grain and fertilizer.a 2013 study of toilet usage conducted by the delhi-based rice institute across five north indian states found that over 40 per cent of households with a functional latrine had at least one person defecating in the open.swachh bharat appears to be going down the same route. as per the programme guidelines, each household is entitled to rs 12,000 to build a toilet, an increase of rs 10,000 under nirmal bharat mission.but in parvar purab, the construction had been unilaterally carried out by the pradhan and panchayat secretary. no one seemed to know how much the new toilets cost.""they brought all the material, cement, bricks, everything was bought by them. they didn't tell us the cost,"" said one woman. as with the nirmal bharat mission, there was no effort to build literacy over use of toilets.the pradhan, a local god-woman named aarti shukla, told us that officials were under pressure to meet construction targets. ""this scheme was introduced and immediately we, the pradhans, were told that we had to finish building the toilets within a month,"" she said. ""so we did not have the time to gather everyone and inform them about the purpose of the scheme.""ram kripal yadav, the union minister of state for drinking water and sanitation (the department that oversees the construction of toilets) said that there was a real demand for the toilets. ""we can't go and forcibly make toilets in someone's home without their permission,"" mr yadav said.but the swachh bharat mission's claims of constructing one crore toilets in one year suggest that like the upa, the nda government is focused almost solely on meeting construction targets. it also means that it has spent close to rs 12,000 crore of the programme's whopping rs 1.34 lakh crore budget, without an indication, at least until now, of toilet usage.""one of the great things included in the swachh bharat guidelines was a survey (to monitor usage of new toilets),"" said sangeeta vyas, managing director of rice. ""but, we haven't heard anything about this survey since december.""googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display(""adslotnativevideo""); });while the construction budget has expanded, the allotment for information, education and communication (iec) under the swachh bharat mission has been halved from 15 per cent to eight per cent of the overall budget. in uttar pradesh, only three per cent of iec funds had been spent since october last year.as the swachh bharat scheme enters its second year, the government claims it is trying to prioritise a shift in attitudes. an official told us that they have conveyed to states that no toilets will be built without public demand.to underline this, regular workshops are being held in new delhi for district collectors from across the country on how to trigger behavioural change. one of the speakers was aarti dogra, the collector, until recently, of bikaner district in rajasthan.ms dogra has been credited with making the district largely open defecation-free through a sustained, two-year-long campaign that began in 2013, and which used women's honour as a persuasive tool.""we talked about the dignity of gram panchayat as being able to provide a dignified atmosphere for women,"" she told us. ""and when women became the central focus point, the issue became that any village which didn't have toilets, whose women and whose daughters and daughters-in-law were going out, this issue became the lack of dignity so to speak of the village,"" she said.in contrast to the government-driven construction model being followed by nirmal bharat and replicated by the swachh bharat abhiyan, the people of bikaner were encouraged to build their own toilets.""if you get something built by the people themselves, they will use it and they will construct it according to their needs. so, throughout we would emphasise that don't look towards us for funds. we would only pay the subsidy after the entire gram panchayat became open defecation-free. now, out of the 219 gram panchayats in bikaner, about 196 have been made open defecation-free and hopefully, now the rest of the district will soon catch up,"" ms dogra added.like bikaner, the government is keen to point to other districts where change is taking place: in chhattisgarh, odisha or karnataka. but in most of these cases, the changes predate the swachh bharat mission and are based on the individual initiative of the local collector.more fundamentally, these isolated instances of championing a community-led model do not seem to have radically changed swachh bharat's subsidy-led, top-down construction-driven approach.but as ms dogra told us, ""you have to create a mindset change. as an administrative system, we will have to start looking at the open defecation-free communities as against just counting the number of toilets that are being built.""",0.08781441869677165,"truth vs hype : crores swachh bharat toilets , users ?","lucknow : parvar purab village , hour uttar pradesh ' capital lucknow , newly-built toilets dot front yards modest homes. brightly painted slogans - ' swachh rahenge , swasth rahenge ( stay clean , stay healthy ) ' ' bahu betiya dur na jaye , ghar mein shauchalay banvaye ( daughters ' go far , build toilets homes ) ' .residents tell us built month two ago.across india , toilets like springing nda ' swachh bharat mission , ambitious scaling upa ' nirmal bharat abhiyan , claimed built 1 crore toilets two years. swachh bharat mission hopes increase tenfold : building 11 crore toilets five years , rate one toilet every second.but nirmal bharat faltered : paper , meant demand-driven , means toilets built people ask them. october last year , visited villages ' sitapur district , found , village village , toilets built local pradhan district administration. one consulted villagers location , design operation toilet. one briefed health risks open defecation. result , toilets unused - turned store rooms grain fertilizer.a 2013 study toilet usage conducted delhi-based rice institute across five north indian states found 40 per cent households functional latrine least one person defecating open.swachh bharat appears going route. per programme guidelines , household entitled rs 12,000 build toilet , increase rs 10,000 nirmal bharat mission.but parvar purab , construction unilaterally carried pradhan panchayat secretary. one seemed know much new toilets cost.

2015-08-12,the dirty filthy north indian," so what's new about the swachh bharat survey of indian cities? nothing. did they really need a survey to tell us that north indian cities and towns are without doubt the dirtiest in the land (and probably in the world)? that delhi (the part administered by the mcd - which is most of the capital) is among the country's 100 filthiest cities, joining 73 other north indian cities in that lowly group. this conglomerate of smelly eyesores (multiple assault on senses) includes our holiest of holy - varanasi, allahabad, ajmer and amritsar. obviously godliness and cleanliness are not related, or at least in the north. the last time i went to vishwanath gali in varanasi, i ran away in disgust; i wasn't going to walk barefoot to the sacred temple, because the idea was quite revolting. the lovely hindi word ""ghin"" (revulsion), describes what one felt. and what is true of the road to the temple is true of the temple, the ghats, and much of varanasi. i could not understand people's love for this eternal city. and i am not alone on this. sample this review from tripadvisor - ""we visited this temple in march 2013. to enter we had to lock our cameras in the locker and we had to take off our shoes. in the previous hindu temples, i had no problem as it was kind of clean, but here you had to cross the street full of cow excrements and pee. in the temple itself it was not different just with that difference that there were monkeys peeing instead of cows.""why don't we feel this when we go to temples in the south? or in their cities? seven of the 10 cleanest cities are from the south, and 39 in the top 100. why is it that south indians (madrasis, as all we northerners disparagingly term them) manage to keep their cities and places of worship cleaner than we do? what is wrong with us? are we just plain uncivilized (as most madrasis would have us believe) or is there something more to it? is it just a north indian hindu problem? it is plausible to argue that our severely caste-ridden society has basically created a people who completely lack any sense of community? we pride ourselves on our caste and our cleanliness at home - we bathe, sweep and swab the house, but the minute we step out of our domain, we don't give a damn. after all, those outside our home are not from our jaat and why should we care about them and their sensibilities? this would explain why my neighbour, who everyday hoses down his driveway, has no compunction in throwing his garbage onto the main road. or why my other neighbour, who is building his palatial home, has covered the pavement with all sorts of building materials.the cleanliness of mysuru (now india's swacchest city) is attributed to a collective and community effort: the government, ngos and people working together to keep a place clean. compare that with delhi. with multiple bodies looking after different aspects of the city, nothing works properly and certainly not in keeping delhi clean. most cities around the world have a system by which garbage is collected by the municipality from outside your doorstep and taken to the landfill in trucks designed for garbage. delhi runs on a multiplicity of systems ranging from throwing the garbage onto the street in front of you, or into the drain nearby, or cycle carts organized by resident welfare associations carrying the garbage to nearby dump. these are often located in front of market places and soon overflow with garbage. once in a while, trucks and earthmovers arrive to load this onto trucks to carry away. amazing! where in the world does this happen except in india? almost a century after western towns streamlined garbage collection, we haven't been able to figure out what to do.it is embarrassing when we compare ourselves to other asian countries outside the old british india. while we all know singapore is antiseptically clean, on the filth index, we trail almost every other asian country without exception. even poor cambodia, which suffered decades of war, violence and pol pot's killing fields, has a better-organized garbage collection system than we do, and siem reap and phnom phen are far cleaner than agra or delhi. so poverty itself is not an excuse; and in any case in india, the better off are much more likely to be dirtying our towns than the poor, who have little to throw. and ask yourself why do these same indians, who go abroad, suddenly become model citizens? they use dustbins, don't throw banana peels from moving vehicles, and stop flicking cigarettes onto the ground. what happens to them? have they suddenly converted to a new religion, or is it the fear of being fined that makes them behave? my guess is the latter. fear is probably the key. for all our north indian bluster, the idea of being punished is not a happy thought. unfortunately, india is a soft state, where punishment seldom happens and a little bit of hafta keeps the law in abeyance. the top clean cities of the world fine heavily for littering.so where is the hope in the swachh bharat scheme? is it in building toilets or building the mindset? delhi got a whole host of public toilets, partly funded by foreign aid, but aside from being used as advertising kiosks, they're ignored by the city's male population which continues to urinate against any wall they feel like. so it has to be a change in the attitude of people. how that is achieved is the real challenge. moralising alone is not going to work, and fining will be blocked by politicians, who fear that any punishment leads to a loss of voter support. aap is a shining example of this belief: autowallahs no longer have to take anyone where they don't want to go, nor follow any metering system, because as the newly-ordained brahmins for supporting aap during the elections, they can do what they want. and as long as this attitude governs our society, we will remain a filthy mess.(ishwari bajpai is senior advisor at ndtv)disclaimer: the opinions expressed within this article are the personal opinions of the author. the facts and opinions appearing in the article do not reflect the views of ndtv and ndtv does not assume any responsibility or liability for the same.",0.08191070367540955,dirty filthy north indian,"' new swachh bharat survey indian cities ?

""karoonga (will do).""i hope he does. because what i said in those brief words goes to the heart of the problems with mr modi's much-vaunted swachh bharat abhiyan.a clean india would benefit all of us, and i had been pleased last year, at some political cost to myself, to support the prime minister's initiative when he asked me to be one of its original nine ambassadors. at the same time, as i also said in accepting his invitation, i am not a fan of tokenism, and i was worried the campaign would descend to symbolic photo opportunities for grandees who would pick up a broom for the cameras on gandhi jayanti, and never touch a broom again till the cameras came back the next october 2nd. clean india is a great campaign idea, the kind of agenda-setting our prime minister excels at, but the real challenge, as i said then, will be to sustain it beyond a week of photo ops.i frankly do not believe this has happened yet. the photo-ops and speeches have continued, and the original nine swachh bharat ambassadors have become over a hundred, with state-level celebrities being added to the national figures chosen by the pm. but india is no cleaner than it was when mr modi first announced his scheme.this is not surprising. as an opposition mp i have had numerous occasions to point out the gap between the prime minister's rhetoric on a number of issues and the reality on the ground. this is a government where ideas are rarely matched by implementation. a central part of the problem, glaringly apparent in the case of swachh bharat, is the lack of adequate funding, commensurate with the announced objectives. as with so much else this government has announced, there is no realistic budget, no credible plan of action, no implementation capacity. just slogans, photo-ops, breaking news.when mr modi announced his abhiyan (mission) he talked about setting up a ""swachh bharat kosh,"" which would benefit from vast amounts of resources to scale up solutions to the problem. there is no sign of such a treasure-chest. instead, the publicity budget for the programme has gone up by a factor of five, while the actual sanitation budget of the government is lower than that of the upa's nirmal bharat abhiyan.it is not just that the government needs money to actually build the toilets, install the dustbins, and improve the drainage facilities it is supposed to establish. it also needs money to ensure that there is water in the toilets it builds, so the toilets are worth using. studies suggest that most of the toilets built since mr modi announced his scheme are unused or unusable because they have no water to flush or clean them.that's not all. if you clean up a street, or a park, or a beach (as i did), you need to create viable alternative places for dumping the garbage and waste that people have got used to dumping on the street, park or beach. if you don't create those alternatives, people will dump their garbage once again in the place you've just cleaned up. those alternative places should incorporate comprehensive waste management systems, from collection to processing, perhaps conversion to biogas or other products. a clean-up, in other words, can't be an end in itself, but a mere first step in a comprehensive effort to improve public sanitation. this simply hasn't happened under the swachh bharat abhiyan.after fulfilling my cleaning drive last october, i wrote to the prime minister about why his government needed to do more to fulfil the objectives of swachh bharat. i took the example of the parvathy puthenaar canal in thiruvananthapuram, a once-beautifully-flowing water body where boats plied, people swam and even drank the water from, till the 1930s or 40s. now, however, the canal is choked with garbage, sewage and weeds; the idea of stepping into it, let along swimming in it, is unthinkable. i pointed out that the canal could be cleaned, at considerable cost. but if it was not to become a sewage dump again, steps would have to be taken to construct effective sewage systems for the people living on both sides of the canal, so their effluents didn't flow into it; waste disposal systems would have to be created so they didn't have to throw their garbage into the water. otherwise the crores spent cleaning it would prove a total waste.but this would require a mammoth effort, which an mp or even a local government would never be able to afford. it would need central funding, the kind of thing that perhaps a swachh bharat kosh - or even a larger nda sanitation budget - could have financed. it was a classic example of the kind of substance that needed to lie beyond the slogans of swachh bharat.mr modi's response? the pm still hasn't even acknowledged my letter, let alone replied to it. the detailed project proposal prepared by the district collector is presumably gathering dust somewhere in the prime minister's office. meanwhile, the canal remains choked up and filthy. and the swachh bharat photo-ops go on.i don't mean to imply that money is everything. there's also citizen involvement. when i cleaned up a section of vizhinjam beach in my constituency, i involved the local community as volunteers, because as the local residents, they were the obvious stakeholders in the exercise, with most at stake in the cleanliness of their immediate environment. since it was a largely muslim community, i involved the mosque and the leadership of the local jama'ath (as well my local congress party workers). with their blessings, it became something everyone in the area could participate in and could share the benefits of - the opposite of a few leaders sweeping a street and disappearing.the upa government appointed and paid ""swachhata preraks"" under the nirmal bharat programme. the nda has apparently abolished the provision, perhaps as a cost-cutting measure, or maybe on the laudable premise that every citizen of india, not just an appointed few, should make cleanliness his or her personal responsibility. it hasn't happened, though.there's a lot to be said in praise of the pm putting cleanliness at the top of the national agenda. as i wrote last year, no individual indian can match the reach of a prime ministerial initiative. when a pm picks up a broom, it is news; the country pays attention. by launching his swachh bharat campaign on the occasion of gandhi jayanti, the prime minister has grabbed the nation's attention. but he simply hasn't done enough with it - and the attention is, inevitably, fading.my fear is that swachh bharat will again be reduced to one of those empty rituals, a label without content, a slogan devoid of substance. if that happens, it will be far worse than if mr modi had never devised swachh bharat in the first place. nothing corrodes a nation's spirit more than empty cynicism - but raising hopes without taking the basic steps to fulfilling them produces the most cynicism of all. swachh bharat should not be reduced to one more modi public-relations gimmick, more visible in the headlines than in the streets.mr prime minister: india deserves better.(dr shashi tharoor is a two-time mp from thiruvananthapuram, the chairman of the parliamentary standing committee on external affairs, the former union minister of state for external affairs and human resource development and the former un under-secretary-general. he has written 15 books, including, most recently, india shastra: reflections on the nation in our time.)disclaimer: the opinions expressed within this article are the personal opinions of the author. the facts and opinions appearing in the article do not reflect the views of ndtv and ndtv does not assume any responsibility or liability for the same.",0.11251717032967032,latest exchange modi-ji clean india,"conversations go , ' lengthy one , fleeting encounters prime minister narendra modi , kind functions meet , rarely permit lengthy discussion. end lunch visiting sri lankan prime minister , mr modi asked , "" swachh bharat kaisa chal raha hai ?

2015-10-04,a giant flop scheme courtesy modi,"the hindu carried on gandhi jayanti a hilarious colour photograph taken last year of modi inaugurating his swachch bharat abhiyan (sba). as the pwd throws a few leaves at his feet, modi picks up a broom, in the company of another five who also pick up their brooms - including one of his security staff - to help modi brush aside the leaves that are so green in colour that they have clearly just been picked rather than actually fallen by the wayside. a great photo-op but illustrative of the total lack of thought that has gone into framing the allegedly ""new"" programme that modi announced from the ramparts of the lal kila in his first independence day speech last year, arms flailing like a windmill but not an iota of a new idea to mark any departure from the already extant nirmal bharat abhiyan. just one more jumla to add to his already large score, designed to befool, not lead to new vistas.unsurprisingly, one year later, available information indicates that the programme is a giant flop that will never reach its target of making india ""open defecation-free"" (odf) by 2019. perhaps results might have been better if modi had been shown, gandhi-like, cleaning his own toilet. but even letting that pass, if modi had shown some understanding of, and course-correcting, what was going wrong with the previous, upa-inspired total sanitation campaign, the outcomes might have been more encouraging. for, in the words of an expert, prof. dean spears, ""modi's swachch bharat abhiyan is essentially the nirmal bharat abhiyan of the previous government and the total sanitation programme with a new name"".in the run-up to the twelfth plan, as this column had pointed out on the same occasion last year, numerous academic studies had established that the problem was not the building of toilets but getting the beneficiaries to use them. this is precisely what the ""new"" swachch bharat abhiyan (sba) should have been measuring: are government-built toilets being used by the whole family? instead, the sba web-site shows that they are still building latrines without any idea of how many are being turned into cattle-sheds, how many members of a household are still going out into the open despite having in-house toilets, and why this is so. as the world bank has pointed out in a recent survey of sanitation in india, if you measure only the physical inputs without measuring the social outcomes, you end up ""manag(ing) what you can measure"".it does not take much to impose a toilet on a household (even if the cost of a government toilet in india is rs. 12,000 per unit as against rs. 2,000 in neighbouring bangladesh). the focus ought to be on motivating people to use the facility, removing from their minds misconceptions about purity and pollution, patiently explaining that millions of babies and children are in danger of losing their lives and their health because of open defecation in the vicinity of habitations. this is the missing element in modi's sba.in the absence of any government surveys measuring such parameters, despite the provision in the sba guidelines that they do so, it has been left to dedicated academics to make sample surveys to discover the truth of the matter. and what they have discovered is truly disturbing. squat (sanitation quality, use, access and trends) have found that in only 26 per cent of rural households is there no open defecation although, on a national average, over 40 percent of these households have in-house toilets. males in large numbers, even in highly prosperous areas like rural punjab, go into the open, leaving the in-house toilet to be used by old women and young brides. there are several reasons why this is so. the first is notions of purity and pollution - that it is ""dirty"" to deposit one's faeces within your own house. such misconceptions have to be deliberately addressed at both the household and community levels. a government propagandist cannot do it; it will have to be done by the more enlightened members of the community at community meetings such as the gram or ward sabhas. another is the absence of adequate running water to make it feasible to repeatedly use a toilet. this requires neighbourhood engineering solutions with day-to-day management through local 'barefoot' plumbers. third, the absence of electricity renders most government toilets unusable. this too requires neighbourhood engineering solutions and a fleet of 'barefoot' electricians. fourth, the mistaken but widespread belief that pit latrines will quickly fill up and then have to be manually cleaned. in fact, it takes up to five years to fill a 60 cubic feet pit. this too requires knowledgeable local 'wise men' patiently explaining matters to households and communities. the explanations will be believed to the extent that they are carried by local advocacy groups speaking in the local dialect. perhaps most important of all, communities have to be alerted to the dangers of open defecation, so that they clearly apprehend that the continuation of traditional practices is a serious threat to the health, indeed the very lives, of their children and other loved ones.it is not just ignorance or blind prejudice that comes in the way of sba but practical difficulties that only truly empowered gram sabhas and panchayats could remove by motivating the community as a whole to recognize the dangers of present practices and the advantages of altering modes of social behaviour and cultural mores. such sanitation extension work cannot be done by sarkari babus and certainly not by exhortations of the prime minister bellowing at ordinary mortals through the exercise of his considerable lung power. this can only be done patiently and quietly in village after village by local leaders speaking the idiom of the common people. to make a success of sba, we need empowered gram sabhas where empowered panchayat leaders are held responsible by those who elected them.25 years ago, a young prime minister, wise beyond his years, clearly saw this. he, therefore, included ""water and sanitation"" in the eleventh schedule which contains the illustrative list of subjects that the constitution indicates for devolution to the panchayats. it is only when that vision is fulfilled that we will get an odf india. tragically, modi does not believe in panchayat raj. certainly, as chief minister gujarat, he ran one of the least impressive panchayat systems in the country. not once did gujarat come anywhere near being declared the state with a relative good panchayat system or as a state progressing towards that goal. so, his sba is bound to fail unless his centralizing tendencies are lobotomized. there is little hope of that, for although he jabbers on about ""cooperative federalism"", that is restricted to power-sharing between the centre and the states. the panchayats, despite being the constitutionally sanctified third tier of government, are nowhere in the picture. and until they are placed absolutely centre-stage, sba will go nowhere.(mani shankar aiyar is a congress mp in the rajya sabha.)disclaimer: the opinions expressed within this article are the personal opinions of the author. the facts and opinions appearing in the article do not reflect the views of ndtv and ndtv does not assume any responsibility or liability for the same.

2015-11-24,he died on diwali inside a sewage pipe," in a few days, on the 29th of november, a group of four safai karmacharis (sweepers) and three beldars (diggers) along with three more senior persons, all working for the new delhi municipal council (ndmc), will be returning from a week-long official trip to japan and south korea where they are learning first-hand about sanitation, cleanliness, waste disposal as well as the maintenance of urban colonies, markets etc. the ndmc chairman, naresh kumar, said, ""we took the decision to boost their morale"".the ndmc would achieve real morale-boosting if it implemented the stringent safety regulations which govern sanitary work in those countries.a week before the team of workers departed, one of their colleagues who, unlike them, was a contract sanitary worker for the delhi jal board (djb), had died inside a pipe in the keshopur sewage treatment plant while repairing a leak.vinay sirohi, only 22 years old, was a high school graduate who was pursuing his graduation ''privately''. his mother, a widow, also works at the same plant. vinay was married to rachna only 11 months ago and had wanted to spend diwali at home but left reluctantly saying that he would be back by 3.00 pm, before the celebrations began.at 2.00 pm, his family was informed that he had gone missing. his body was found the next day after the police used gas cutters to cut through the pipe.according to the rules, sirohi should have been accompanied by two other workers when he entered the pipeline, but he went in alone; he should have been wearing a helmet, a face mask and gum boots with a safety rope around his waist, but he went in bereft of all these. a newspaper report said that ''following the incident, officials of the sewage treatment plant are likely to issue an advisory for operators and workers about the safety precautions to be taken''. that should do a lot for their morale!deaths like vinay sirohi's occur almost every day and are reported in the papers in small paragraphs that are hard to find. the fact that he died so young on diwali, a day of joyous celebration, made his death poignant enough to merit a few headlines and photographs of his grieving wife and mother in several dailies in the national capital. tv channels also covered the ''event''. had they taken the trouble to show their viewers how he died, it might have shocked many into demanding real change in the lives of sanitation workers. the fact that what happened was happening in the national capital may have brought the reality behind the facade of the swachh bharat campaign home to many.sanitation workers who clean out sewage blockages have to immerse themselves in a hell-hole. once in, they are assaulted by a ''sudden blast of putrid sludge - besides methane, hydrogen sulphide, carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide''. a worker who has been there and back says ''even if we manage not to swallow the toxic muck, it manages to enter our bodies'' (from the drishti documentary ""lesser humans"").in 2005, a study of sewer workers titled ''hole to hell'' was conducted by the center for education and communication (cec), delhi. dr ashish mittal, an occupational health physician who co-authored the report, says, ""a manhole is a confined, oxygen-deficient space where the presence of noxious gases can cause syncope - a sudden and transient loss of consciousness... the long term neurological effects of syncope can be debilitating"". in developed countries, like the ones the sanitation workers from delhi are currently visiting, the sewers are well-lit and aerated with huge fans and the workers are protected by bunny suits and respiratory apparatus. in delhi, the workers wear a belt connected with thick ropes to men outside but this offers them no protection against gases and sharp objects that assault them inside. poor vinay did not even have a rope. during mittal's six-month study using 200 workers, three of them died. the average age of sanitary workers is said to be 45 years.a 2007 article in tehelka magazine estimated that there are at least 1,43,000 sewer workers in urban india. assuming a mortality rate of 25 for this group, 3,575 sewer workers die every year, 10 every day. (according to visaria, member of the advisory council of the population foundation of india, tehelka's is a ''very conservative'' projection.)the government of india is holding a special two-day session of parliament on november 25-26 to honour dr br ambedkar whose 125th birth anniversary falls on april 14 next year. it would be most appropriate if the inhuman exploitation of sanitation workers is discussed and condemned in this session and immediate steps taken to bring their working conditions to the level prevailing in civilised countries. otherwise, the workers returning from japan and korea and hundreds of thousands like them will find little to ''boost their morale''. they will only be confronted with images of other vinays and other grieving widows, mothers and children.(subhashini ali is former mp, former member of the national commission for women and vice president of the all india democratic women's association.)disclaimer: the opinions expressed within this article are the personal opinions of the author. the facts and opinions appearing in the article do not reflect the views of ndtv and ndtv does not assume any responsibility or liability for the same.",0.0006407264610389618,died diwali inside sewage pipe,"days , 29th november , group four safai karmacharis ( sweepers ) three beldars ( diggers ) along three senior persons , working new delhi municipal council ( ndmc ) , returning week-long official trip japan south korea learning first-hand sanitation , cleanliness , waste disposal well maintenance urban colonies , markets etc. ndmc chairman , naresh kumar , said , "" took decision boost morale "" .the ndmc would achieve real morale-boosting implemented stringent safety regulations govern sanitary work countries.a week team workers departed , one colleagues , unlike , contract sanitary worker delhi jal board ( djb ) , died inside pipe keshopur sewage treatment plant repairing leak.vinay sirohi , 22 years old , high school graduate pursuing graduation ' ' privately ' ' . mother , widow , also works plant. vinay married rachna 11 months ago wanted spend diwali home left reluctantly saying would back 3.00 pm , celebrations began.at 2.00 pm , family informed gone missing. body found next day police used gas cutters cut pipe.according rules , sirohi accompanied two workers entered pipeline , went alone ; wearing helmet , face mask gum boots safety rope around waist , went bereft these. newspaper report said ' ' following incident , officials sewage treatment plant likely issue advisory operators workers safety precautions taken ' ' . lot morale ! deaths like vinay sirohi ' occur almost every day reported papers small paragraphs hard find. fact died young diwali , day joyous celebration , made death poignant enough merit headlines photographs grieving wife mother several dailies national capital. tv channels also covered ' ' event ' ' . taken trouble show viewers died , might shocked many demanding real change lives sanitation workers. fact happened happening national capital may brought reality behind facade swachh bharat campaign home many.sanitation workers clean sewage blockages immerse hell-hole. , assaulted ' ' sudden blast putrid sludge - besides methane , hydrogen sulphide , carbon dioxide carbon monoxide ' ' . worker back says ' ' even manage swallow toxic muck , manages enter bodies ' ' ( drishti documentary "" lesser humans "" ) .in 2005 , study sewer workers titled ' ' hole hell ' ' conducted center education communication ( cec ) , delhi. dr ashish mittal , occupational health physician co-authored report , says , "" manhole confined , oxygen-deficient space presence noxious gases cause syncope - sudden transient loss consciousness ... long term neurological effects syncope debilitating "" . developed countries , like ones sanitation workers delhi currently visiting , sewers well-lit aerated huge fans workers protected bunny suits respiratory apparatus. delhi , workers wear belt connected thick ropes men outside offers protection gases sharp objects assault inside. poor vinay even rope. mittal ' six-month study using 200 workers , three died. average age sanitary workers said 45 years.a 2007 article tehelka magazine estimated least 1,43,000 sewer workers urban india. assuming mortality rate 25 group , 3,575 sewer workers die every year , 10 every day.

""given the fact that there are multiple other levies such as licence fee, applicable on telecommunication industry, sbc should not be levied on telecommunication services,"" it said. regarding direct taxes, coai said there is some uncertainty on the withholding tax obligation, if any, under section 194j of the income tax act, 1961 on payments made in consideration for spectrum acquired through trading. ""therefore, a clarification may be issued that payments made in connection with the trading/sharing of spectrum are not in the nature of royalty and hence do not attract withholding tax obligations,"" it added. it said this would facilitate an effective implementation of spectrum trading and reduce any potential tax dispute arising out of such transactions. the industry body has also sought to amend the definition of the term 'royalty' with retrospective effect to exclude telephony, internet bandwidth and other similar services. coai said domestic as well as cross-border payments in respect of a wide array of telecom services are under litigation on account of retrospective amendment in the definition of 'royalty' vide finance act, 2012.

2016-10-05,swachh bharat mission's success is greatly exaggerated," october 2, 2016 marked the second anniversary of the launch of swachh bharat mission (sbm) - an event that most will remember for the photo-ops of the prime minister sweeping the streets of lutyens delhi. for those of us who have been following sanitation policy, this photo-op was, in fact, a watershed moment. it marked the first time that an indian prime minister had chosen to stake his political capital on an issue as unglamorous and complex as sanitation. this political moment was an opportunity that most sanitation enthusiasts had been waiting for. so how well has the prime minister been able to convert this high-voltage sanitation campaign into sustained action on the ground? for the moment, it is near impossible to answer this question. this is because the current administrative database (or management information system) for sanitation is deeply flawed. in december 2015, researchers from the accountability initiative, centre for policy research, set out to track the experiences of beneficiaries of the government's sanitation interventions by conducting a household survey using the government's database. the objective was to identify households whose names featured in the database as having ""achieved sanitation"" by constructing a toilet using some money provided by the government. we hit our first bottleneck when we tried to pilot the survey. households whose names featured on the government list couldn't be found and; on close inspection, we discovered that the lists were populated by duplicate names and ghost beneficiaries. to top this, there where many instances when the names of villages and habitations were misspelt, making a full-fledged audit of the government database impossible. eventually, we identified 1,500 households in our sample of 7,500 spread across 10 districts in five states, that, in fact, featured in the government's database. it would be reasonable to expect that these households would have toilets even if they weren't using them. much to our surprise, we found that nearly 1/3rd households didn't have toilets. a further 36% of households that had toilets reported that these were unusable. there were district variations. nalanda and udaipur had the largest gaps between the toilets reported and the actual presence of these them as compared to other districts like satara, where this was not the case.by government rules, every household whose name features in the achievement list ought to have been ""monitored"" by a government official and to have received some money as part of the toilet construction incentive drive. we found that as many as 38% households whose names featured in the achievement list had not been visited by a government official. more interestingly a mere 60% of those who had applied for money from the government actually reported receiving it. so for all intents and purposes, featuring in the swachh bharat mission's mis is no guarantee that a household has a toilet, or if it does, that this toilet has been supported through government financing in any way.our field work suggests that the primary reason for this data mess is the sheer lack of capacity at the block and district level where this data is compiled. most districts complained of a lack of staff including data operators. consequently, those officials who are in-position are now overburdened as districts are under pressure to meet targets, leading to obvious errors. gaps in the administrative data system apart from our survey also identified other critical limitations in the implementation of the swachh bharat mission. most of the districts we surveyed report low toilet coverage: only half of our surveyed households reported having a toilet and open defecation is very high. the good news is that toilets are being constructed especially in areas that need it most. since april 2014 (when sanitation first came in to sharp political focus), low coverage districts such as jhalawar, rajasthan (7% toilet coverage in 2011 census) sagar, madhya pradesh (11% coverage in 2011) and purnea, bihar (9% coverage in 2011) have seen some movement in toilet construction. but much of this construction is taking place with minimal government assistance. a mere 24% of households that had constructed toilets between april 2014 and december 2015 had received any money from government. pm narendra modi launched the swachh bharat abhiyan (clean india campaign) in new delhi in october, 2014this low government support is not because households didn't want money. 94% of our sample met the government's eligibility criteria for financial incentives and more than half of these eligible beneficiaries had applied for government assistance. however, only 1/5th actually received any money from the government. this despite the fact that allocations for rural sanitation have nearly quadrupled increasing from rs 2,300 crores in 2013-14 to rs 9, 000 crores in 2016-17. but what was even more worrying is that 61% of of our sample had no knowledge of the government's toilet construction incentive program under the swachh bharat mission.googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display(""adslotnativevideo""); });what explains this? one of the most important contributions of the swachh bharat mission and the pm's own engagement in the sanitation drive is the recognition that the challenge of sanitation can only be addressed through a concerted effort in awareness-raising and changing behaviour. in its guidelines, the swachh bharat mission clearly highlights the importance of awareness drives and goes so far as to recommend that state governments appoint swachhta doots or swachhta senas in every village. these swachhta doots would be tasked with engaging citizens in conversation about sanitation and promoting toilet usage. but for all the high-voltage campaigns, the swachh bharat mission has failed to put its money where its mouth is. this will come as a surprise to most readers who have been treated to vidya balan's appeals to the indian public to use toilets; expenditure on information education and communication (iec) - government parlance for awareness programs - decreased from 8% of total expenditure in 2013-14 to 1% in 2015-16. it should be no surprise then that for large parts of india, the swachh bharat mission remains invisible. the numbers from our survey are telling. only 6% of the households were aware of swachhta doots in their village. a mere 10% reported an awareness programme on sanitation being conducted in their village, and only 3% of households reported being visited by someone from within the government to explain the benefits of the programmme. thus even people who want to construct toilets remain unaware of details like the availability of financial incentives from government. as 2019 inches closer, the pressure to meet targets is only likely to increase. but to achieve these targets, urgent action needs to be taken to make the swachh bharat mission visible to people. first and foremost, the administrative databases must be cleaned up. we cannot set targets and make policy without accurate data. this needs a combination of strategies including independent checks and audits both by government machinery and non-government researchers. second, efforts need to be made on a war footing to promote innovative action on the awareness component of the scheme in a way that rewards districts and panchayats that are genuinely creative. rather than getting vidya balan and others to do radio gigs, the country will be better served if swachhta doots are appointed and trained. for the moment, most districts are following a common template - a few tv ads, slogans on walls and the threat of punitive measures if households don't build toilets. there are government orders in some districts that threaten to cut of electricity and ration supplies if households don't construct toilets! this is exactly the wrong way of achieving the target of open defaction free villages. in the ultimate analysis, the challenge of achieving and sustaining sanitation in india goes beyond mere toilet construction. it requires a concerted effort to change behavior and deal with complex issues of caste and social organization. the pm took an important step by making sanitation a political issue but if his government is to achieve its targets, it needs to go beyond the photo-ops to building an implementation system that is visible and creative on the ground.

a dream seen by our forefathers and freedom fighters. we were free to imagine and build our nation anew.for our independence, we owe so much to the countless freedom fighters who made great sacrifices to bring us here.chennamma, the rani of kittur. lakshmibai of jhansi. matangini hazra, the heroine and martyr of the quit india movement. there are so many examples.matangini hazra was an elderly woman, into her 70s. she was shot by the colonial police in tamluk, in bengal, while leading a peaceful protest march. she died with ""vande mataram"" on her lips and with the hope of a free india in her heart.freedom fighters like sardar bhagat singh, chandrashekhar azad, ram prasad bismil, ashfaqullah khan, birsa munda and thousands of others gave their lives for us. we can never forget them.gandhiji was not alone in this nationwide struggle for freedom and reform. netaji subhas chandra bose exhorted our people, saying: ""give me blood and i will give you freedom"". at his word, millions of indians joined the freedom movement under his leadership and gave their all.nehru ji emphasised that india's age-old heritage and traditions - so dear to us - could co-exist with technology and a quest to modernise our society.sardar patel instilled in us the importance of national unity and integrity. and of a disciplined national character.bhim rao ambedkar urged upon us the virtues of constitutional governance, of the rule of law - and of the vital need for education.a tradition i remember from my childhood was that when there was a wedding in one family, the entire village shared the responsibility and contributed. regardless of the caste or community, the bride became the daughter of not just a single family but of the entire village.there was a sense of caring and of sharing, and of inter-dependence. if you helped your neighbours in their times of need, they instinctively helped you in turn.today, in big cities we may not even know our neighbours. whether in cities or villages, it is important to reignite that sense of caring and sharing. this will make us a gentler and happier society and help us understand each other with greater empathy.we should also work with unity and purpose to ensure that the benefits of government policies reach all sections of society. for this, the partnership between citizens and government remains essential.the government is building toilets or helping build toilets - but it is for each of us to use those toilets and make india open-defecation free.the government can frame laws and strengthen law enforcement - but it is for each of us to be a law-abiding citizen and build a law-abiding society.the government is implementing gst to eliminate multiple taxes and simplify transactions - but it is for each of us to make this an essential part of our everyday transactions and business culture. i am happy that the transition to the gst system has been smooth.in the year 2022, our country will complete 75 years of independence. it is our national resolve to attain certain desired milestones for a new india by then.when we speak of a new india, what do we mean? there are some obvious parameters - like a house for every family, power on demand, better roads and telecom, a modern railway network, rapid and sustained growth.new india must be a society rushing towards the future, but also a compassionate society. a compassionate society where the traditionally disadvantaged, whether scs, sts or obcs, are part of our national developmental process.i am confident that a strong partnership between citizens and the government will allow us to meet the goals of new india.your immense patience and understanding in the days following demonetisation - and your whole-hearted support in the battle against corruption and black money - reflected a responsible and enlightened society.demonetisation has boosted our efforts to build an honest society. we must sustain this spirit and this momentum.poverty and new india are simply not compatible.today, the world is looking at india with admiration. our country is seen as a responsible global citizen, a growing economy, and a solution provider to various international challenges - such as climate change, disasters, conflicts, humanitarian crises, radicalism and terrorism.as citizens and children of india - whether we live at home or abroad - we must ask ourselves how we can add to our country's pride.our soldiers who guard our borders, on a hot day in the desert or high up on a cold mountain, are not just doing their duty. they are displaying an extra degree of selflessness.our police and paramilitary forces that brave death to combat terrorism or crime and keep us safe are not just doing their duty. they are displaying an extra degree of selflessness.on an appeal from the prime minister, more than one crore families voluntarily gave up their lpg fuel subsidy - so that a gas cylinder could reach the kitchen of a poorer family of fellow indians. and so that members of that family, particularly women, were saved from smoke from chulhas that damaged their eyes and lungs.i would urge you, as fellow nation builders, to help educate less-privileged children in our society. help teach a child other than your own. enrol and pay the school fees or buy the books of at least one child other than your own. just one!two thousand five hundred years ago gautam buddha said, ""be a lamp unto yourself ..."" if we follow his teachings, acting together, with the passion of our freedom movement, we can collectively be the 125 crore lamps that light up the path to a new india.googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display(""adslotnativevideo""); });",0.1540222162097162,"president ram nath kovind praises notes ban , gst first independence day speech","new delhi : highlightspresident kovind remembers freedom fighters address stresses participation citizens development hails government moves like demonetisation , swachh bharat campaignwindow._pricee = window._pricee &#124; &#124; [ ] ; _pricee.push( { container : ' _pcwgtmid ' } ) ; india celebrates 70 years independence , president ram nath kovind addressed nation part decades old tradition. first independence day address , hailed various government policies including goods services tax , swachh india campaign notes ban. since election , president kovind given assent six legislations within three weeks taking charge. one legislations extension jurisdiction trial cases maritime claims , arrests detentions ships various courts. last year , former president pranab mukherjee asserted intolerance violence betrayal letter spirit democracy.here live updates ram nath kovind ' speech ahead india ' independence day : august 15 , 1947 , became free nation. sovereignty responsibility destiny moved british crown people india.it culmination dream country -

""time therefore is running against us,"" mr jaitley said. in the next one or two decades, if india has to take a challenge for moving into a higher economic group country, ""we have to grow at a much faster pace,"" he said.mr jaitley in response to a question refuted the impression that transformational initiatives like swachh bharat, gst and demonetisation have not resulted in the desired changes on ground.""would you say there are long term benefits and the country would have to wait for those? or is there any way to mitigate the problem being faced by the country,"" the union finance minister was asked.a more serious analysis, he argued, would show that even within matter of months there is a short term positive impact of all these projects.while demonetisation and gst are having the desired impact in terms of tax compliances and squeezing the quantum of cash in the economy, the minister said for the first time, swachh bharat campaign has brought to fore the importance of sanitation and cleanliness.observing that sizable progress is being made in terms of sanitation and cleanliness, he said for the first time in indian history this has become a centrestage agenda and is moving forward. the campaign is having both short term and long-term impact.""it's a movement that has become far beyond a governmental program. it a mass movement,"" mr jaitley said.before demonetisation, indian normal was to live with a high cash economy, not paying taxes, ""you buy a property, you transact partly in cash, and in business you maintain two sets of accounts,"" he said.""how can a country, which aims to be the fastest growing major economy in the world, which aspires to grow from a developing to a developed economy, continue with the normal of this type,"" he asked.and therefore, ""you need to shake the system"" in order to reduce the quantum of cash in india and therefore obviously to make it a more tax complaint society, he observed. cash itself involves several challenges. it leads to corruption and several other problems.""let's see for even those why say that there is no short-term advantage, has the number of tax payers in india immediately increased in the matter of months? the truth is, it has.""has the digitisation transaction increased from rs 70 crores to rs 130 crores today, it almost doubled,"" the finance minister said.googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display(""adslotnativevideo""); });in the immediate aftermath of demonetisation, mr jaitley said there has been a sharp reduction in insurgent and terror activities in states like jammu & kashmir and chhattisgarh. the funding of the terror itself has gotten squeezed, he told students at berkeley.""you are having terrorist incidents (now), but the fact that you were finding 5,000-10,000 stone throwers being provided with money by terrorist organisations, why is it that in the last 8-10 months it has not happened?"" he asked.moving on to gst, the minister said this has resulted in creation of a national tax structure. ""in the three months, you have all the check points in states disappeared, you have clear flow of goods and services which has started all over the country,"" he said, adding that companies are sharing information about the distributors and retailers.slowly the whole chain is becoming simpler and transparent, he said, adding that today many more people have registered themselves.acknowledging that the problem with them is related to compliance burden, mr jaitley said the gst council has noted these challenges and is taking steps to address them. ""but in terms of cash collection, the whole process going online, the process of ... coming down, ...one thing i can tell you the tendency of some to have the whole chain operate in cash will suffer a setback,"" mr jaitley said.gst, he said has been a ""reasonable smooth transformation,"" but there is scope for improvement. ""i think in gst council we have succeeded in creating india's first federal institution,"" he said.the transition, he said, would be a far more successful experience which will plug the holes into india's taxation system.responding to questions, mr jaitley said the indian government wants to encourage startups. he said india now has an aspirational population which wants changes and reforms at a fast pace itself, but also are impatient in this regard.""the obvious challenge to the country is to grow and grow fast. it has to grow at a much higher rate than we have been growing in recent history,"" he said adding that the benefits of the growth must also reach that section of the population which till date has been the least serviced one.for this, more resources are required.india, he told the berkeley students, has transformed out of a more conservative mindset and is not tuned to getting integrated globally much more than it was in the past.therefore, policies with regard to technologies and getting investment into india are much broader than they have been in the past, he said.observing that conventionally india was a far more difficult place to do business, he said that situation has substantially improved for the better.identifying corruption as one of the two stigmas for india, mr jaitley said the institutional mechanism to fight corruption has become much stronger.asserting that direct taxes have to become ""more rational and more reasonable"" the union finance minister said he has already announced a road map to bring down the corporate tax to about 25 per cent and is trying to ensure that india becomes a far more compliance society and also tax assessment is more technology driven rather than human interaction.

2018-10-02,blog: how we can turn into a clean nation in 12 months - by sadhguru,"historically, we as a culture have always invested heavily both in personal and public hygiene. even today, most women will not enter the kitchen without a morning bath. no one enters a temple without a shower. no yogic practice is performed without cleansing the body first. taking care of the internal and external cleanliness of the body has remained with us. however, the awareness that we need to keep our public places clean has taken a beating. this has happened because bharat - the greatest economy on the planet 25 decades ago - decimated itself under the expert care of colonial guile. industries were destroyed. taxation was backbreaking. this slowly took us to a place where no one had the means, energy or resource to maintain public hygiene and sanitation.unfortunately, even after independence, governments have not taken enough care to organize cleanliness in the public space. this is not a complaint. maybe we had other things to do. but today, we know that lack of public hygiene is costing the nation dearly. malnourishment and lack of public hygiene generally complement each other. repeated bouts of bacterial and parasitical infection in the digestive tract take away the ability to absorb nutrients. this has happened to millions of children in the country.the lack of toilets is also a major issue for women. with the population growth in the last few decades, a woman has no private space left outside. so the government's initiative to build millions of toilets across the country in the last four years is much needed. but while most of india now has access to a toilet, there are still various cultural and logistics issues that the government is trying to address.it has to be understood that in this country, nothing changes just by changing policies. it takes an emotional movement, which is what i believe prime minister narendra modi is doing with the swachh bharat movement. the process of wanting to clean india is not an overnight job. at the same time, if we can inspire all citizens, it would happen much more quickly.when the prime minister announced swachh bharat on independence day a few years ago, a certain section of society was making comments, ""why is the prime minister talking about pedestrian issues when there are larger issues to be addressed?""these people do not realize that a large mass of india is pedestrian. addressing pedestrian issues is of national interest. without creating a clean nation, developing a nation into a great possibility will be out of question because the infections we carry within us will not allow us to become full-fledged human beings. besides the individual's role, today, there are many technologies evolving in the world to transform filth into wealth. there is no such thing as waste. it is just a question of whether we know how to use something or not. the time has come when we have to learn to transform everything and use it for our well-being. what was earth, we made into filth. we must at least be able to transform it back to earth. googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display(""adslotnativevideo""); });there is substantial knowledge - both traditional and new - on how to do this. we must make the transforming of filth into wealth a part of our national ethos. every city, municipality and village panchayat must take it up. for example, a city like mumbai generates 2.1 billion litres of sewage per day. most of it goes to the sea. but if this is treated and used in micro-irrigation, it can water thousands of hectares of agriculture. if you add up sewage from 200 indian cities and towns, it comes to 36 billion litres which can micro-irrigate 3 to 9 million hectares. whether it is river pollution, plastic waste or domestic waste, if you show people that what they think is filth can become wealth, you will not find any filth anywhere. swachh bharat is not just the prime minister's movement. it is a crucial step for india to move ahead and truly prosper. our jawans are standing at our borders, risking their lives every day. our farmers work hard to feed the nation. our industrial workers are sweating it out to give us a foothold in the world. one simple way through which we can show our love for our country is by creating swachh bharat. i'm sure if all of us are determined, we can turn this into a clean nation in twelve months' time. let us take this commitment that before mahatma's jayanti in 2019, we will create a clean india on every level - on the streets, at home, in rooting out corruption, and in our own minds and hearts.remember, this is a culture that built consciousness of cleanliness through public drainage systems before any other.let us make it happen.(ranked amongst the 50 most influential people in india, sadhguru is a yogi, mystic, visionary and best-selling author. sadhguru has been conferred the ""padma vibhushan"" by the government of india in 2017, the highest annual civilian award, accorded for exceptional and distinguished service.)disclaimer: the opinions expressed within this article are the personal opinions of the author. the facts and opinions appearing in the article do not reflect the views of ndtv and ndtv does not assume any responsibility or liability for the same.",0.12679486006950794,blog : turn clean nation 12 months - sadhguru,"historically , culture always invested heavily personal public hygiene. even today , women enter kitchen without morning bath. one enters temple without shower. yogic practice performed without cleansing body first. taking care internal external cleanliness body remained us. however , awareness need keep public places clean taken beating. happened bharat - greatest economy planet 25 decades ago - decimated expert care colonial guile. industries destroyed. taxation backbreaking. slowly took us place one means , energy resource maintain public hygiene sanitation.unfortunately , even independence , governments taken enough care organize cleanliness public space. complaint. maybe things do. today , know lack public hygiene costing nation dearly. malnourishment lack public hygiene generally complement other. repeated bouts bacterial parasitical infection digestive tract take away ability absorb nutrients. happened millions children country.the lack toilets also major issue women. population growth last decades , woman private space left outside. government ' initiative build millions toilets across country last four years much needed. india access toilet , still various cultural logistics issues government trying address.it understood country , nothing changes changing policies. takes emotional movement , believe prime minister narendra modi swachh bharat movement. process wanting clean india overnight job. time , inspire citizens , would happen much quickly.when prime minister announced swachh bharat independence day years ago , certain section society making comments , "" prime minister talking pedestrian issues larger issues addressed ?

2018-10-02,blog: how we can turn into a clean nation in 12 months - by sadhguru,"historically, we as a culture have always invested heavily both in personal and public hygiene. even today, most women will not enter the kitchen without a morning bath. no one enters a temple without a shower. no yogic practice is performed without cleansing the body first. taking care of the internal and external cleanliness of the body has remained with us. however, the awareness that we need to keep our public places clean has taken a beating. this has happened because bharat - the greatest economy on the planet 25 decades ago - decimated itself under the expert care of colonial guile. industries were destroyed. taxation was backbreaking. this slowly took us to a place where no one had the means, energy or resource to maintain public hygiene and sanitation.unfortunately, even after independence, governments have not taken enough care to organize cleanliness in the public space. this is not a complaint. maybe we had other things to do. but today, we know that lack of public hygiene is costing the nation dearly. malnourishment and lack of public hygiene generally complement each other. repeated bouts of bacterial and parasitical infection in the digestive tract take away the ability to absorb nutrients. this has happened to millions of children in the country.the lack of toilets is also a major issue for women. with the population growth in the last few decades, a woman has no private space left outside. so the government's initiative to build millions of toilets across the country in the last four years is much needed. but while most of india now has access to a toilet, there are still various cultural and logistics issues that the government is trying to address.it has to be understood that in this country, nothing changes just by changing policies. it takes an emotional movement, which is what i believe prime minister narendra modi is doing with the swachh bharat movement. the process of wanting to clean india is not an overnight job. at the same time, if we can inspire all citizens, it would happen much more quickly.when the prime minister announced swachh bharat on independence day a few years ago, a certain section of society was making comments, ""why is the prime minister talking about pedestrian issues when there are larger issues to be addressed?""these people do not realize that a large mass of india is pedestrian. addressing pedestrian issues is of national interest. without creating a clean nation, developing a nation into a great possibility will be out of question because the infections we carry within us will not allow us to become full-fledged human beings. besides the individual's role, today, there are many technologies evolving in the world to transform filth into wealth. there is no such thing as waste. it is just a question of whether we know how to use something or not. the time has come when we have to learn to transform everything and use it for our well-being. what was earth, we made into filth. we must at least be able to transform it back to earth. googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display(""adslotnativevideo""); });there is substantial knowledge - both traditional and new - on how to do this. we must make the transforming of filth into wealth a part of our national ethos. every city, municipality and village panchayat must take it up. for example, a city like mumbai generates 2.1 billion litres of sewage per day. most of it goes to the sea. but if this is treated and used in micro-irrigation, it can water thousands of hectares of agriculture. if you add up sewage from 200 indian cities and towns, it comes to 36 billion litres which can micro-irrigate 3 to 9 million hectares. whether it is river pollution, plastic waste or domestic waste, if you show people that what they think is filth can become wealth, you will not find any filth anywhere. swachh bharat is not just the prime minister's movement. it is a crucial step for india to move ahead and truly prosper. our jawans are standing at our borders, risking their lives every day. our farmers work hard to feed the nation. our industrial workers are sweating it out to give us a foothold in the world. one simple way through which we can show our love for our country is by creating swachh bharat. i'm sure if all of us are determined, we can turn this into a clean nation in twelve months' time. let us take this commitment that before mahatma's jayanti in 2019, we will create a clean india on every level - on the streets, at home, in rooting out corruption, and in our own minds and hearts.remember, this is a culture that built consciousness of cleanliness through public drainage systems before any other.let us make it happen.(ranked amongst the 50 most influential people in india, sadhguru is a yogi, mystic, visionary and best-selling author. sadhguru has been conferred the ""padma vibhushan"" by the government of india in 2017, the highest annual civilian award, accorded for exceptional and distinguished service.)disclaimer: the opinions expressed within this article are the personal opinions of the author. the facts and opinions appearing in the article do not reflect the views of ndtv and ndtv does not assume any responsibility or liability for the same.",0.12679486006950794,blog : turn clean nation 12 months - sadhguru,"historically , culture always invested heavily personal public hygiene. even today , women enter kitchen without morning bath. one enters temple without shower. yogic practice performed without cleansing body first. taking care internal external cleanliness body remained us. however , awareness need keep public places clean taken beating. happened bharat - greatest economy planet 25 decades ago - decimated expert care colonial guile. industries destroyed. taxation backbreaking. slowly took us place one means , energy resource maintain public hygiene sanitation.unfortunately , even independence , governments taken enough care organize cleanliness public space. complaint. maybe things do. today , know lack public hygiene costing nation dearly. malnourishment lack public hygiene generally complement other. repeated bouts bacterial parasitical infection digestive tract take away ability absorb nutrients. happened millions children country.the lack toilets also major issue women. population growth last decades , woman private space left outside. government ' initiative build millions toilets across country last four years much needed. india access toilet , still various cultural logistics issues government trying address.it understood country , nothing changes changing policies. takes emotional movement , believe prime minister narendra modi swachh bharat movement. process wanting clean india overnight job. time , inspire citizens , would happen much quickly.when prime minister announced swachh bharat independence day years ago , certain section society making comments , "" prime minister talking pedestrian issues larger issues addressed ?
