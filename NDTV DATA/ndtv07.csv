the prime minister said earlier this year that the insurance industry needs more capital than what domestic industry can provide. this bill was once seen as a key expression of the upa's intent to introduce major reforms in the financial sector. similarly, the banking laws (amendment) bill sought to increase the cap on fdi from 26% to 49%. today's rejection of the bills suggests what india inc has been dreading - that when it comes to key legislation, the government will remain painfully pregnant, unable to deliver the economic reforms that the prime minister has been heralded for in the past. googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display(""adslotnativevideo"");

""a good example of such use is the aadhar programme for providing all the residents of our country a unique identity, and also the direct benefits transfer scheme based on aadhar numbers that our government launched a few months back.... ""it will lead to better targeting of subsidies and reducing delays in the delivery of benefits such as scholarships and pensions to the intended beneficiaries. it will also help in curbing wastages and leakages, and result in greater financial inclusion,"" dr singh said. the direct benefits transfer (dbt) scheme now covers 121 districts of the country. ""i think it is also important to recognise the fact that the programmes like the direct benefits scheme also give a sense of empowerment to the people, increase their faith in the processes of governance and therefore have a far larger positive effect than can be measured by the direct advantages they give,"" he said asking the bureaucrats, involved directly or indirectly in its implementation, to ensure the scheme is a success. the dbt scheme provides for cash transfer of subsidy from the government directly to an aadhar-linked beneficiary's bank account. ""our government has also made sustained efforts to curb corruption and enhance transparency and accountability in the work of public authorities. there are several legislative initiatives that we have taken in this regard, for example the right to information act, the lokpal and lokayuktas bill and the whistleblowers protection bill. ""these are intended to also help in improving the standards of delivery of public services in our country,"" the pm said. dr singh said there was a need to take special care of socially and economically backward people of society in order to provide access to quality education and health services at affordable costs, safe drinking water, sanitation and so on to the citizens. ""we must recognise that we have a lot of work to do to bring the delivery of some of our public services up to international standards,"" he said. citing the right of citizens for time bound delivery of goods and services and redressal of their grievances bill, 2011, which is under consideration of parliament, dr singh said, the proposed law when enacted will give citizens the right to receive specified goods and services in a time bound manner. ""i would also like to mention in passing the need for strengthening the implementation of our flagship mahatma gandhi national rural employment guarantee scheme, which by most accounts has been a success,"" dr singh said. he said there was a need for much greater attention for management of urbanisation. ""management of urbanisation is an area which requires much greater attention on the part of our planners. it is estimated that in 20 years' time, nearly 50 per cent of our population will be living in urban areas. ""we have to ensure that our towns and cities provide public services of a high quality to their residents. to that end, much greater attention has to be paid to the modernisation of the processes of municipal governance. our civil services also should be better equipped with skills for managing urbanisation and urban spaces,"" he said, stressing on training of government servants for capacity building. addressing the bureaucrats, the prime minister emphasized on ways for effective management in dealing with natural disasters. owing to its peculiar geo-climatic conditions, india has always been vulnerable to natural disasters such as floods, droughts, cyclones, earthquakes and landslides. climate change is likely to further exacerbate the frequency and intensity of these natural disasters, dr singh said.

2017-01-24,silicon valley should learn from india's moves toward less-cash," silicon valley fancies itself the global leader in innovation. its leaders hype technologies such as bitcoin and blockchain, which some claim are the greatest inventions since the internet. they are so complex that only a few mathematicians can understand them, and they require massive computing resources to operate - yet billions of dollars are invested in them.india may have leapfrogged the u.s. technology industry with simple and practical innovations and massive grunt work. it has built a digital infrastructure that will soon process billions more transactions than bitcoin ever has. with this, india will skip two generations of financial technologies and build something as monumental as china's great wall and america's interstate highways.a decade ago, india had a massive problem: nearly half its people did not have any form of identification. when you are born in a village without hospitals or government services, you don't get a birth certificate. if you can't prove who you are, you can't open a bank account or get a loan or insurance; you are doomed to be part of the informal economy - whose members live in the shadows and don't pay taxes.in 2009, the government launched a massive project, called aadhar, to solve this problem by providing a digital identity to everyone based on an individual's fingerprints and retina scans. as of 2016, the program had issued 12-digit identification numbers to 1.1 billion people. this was the largest and most successful i.t. project in the world and created the foundation for a digital economy.india's next challenge was to provide everyone with a bank account. its government sanctioned the opening of 11 institutions called payment banks, which can hold money but don't do lending. to motivate people to open accounts, it offered free life insurance with them and made them a channel for social-welfare benefits. within three years, more than 270 million bank accounts were opened, with $10 billion in deposits.and then india launched its unified payment interface (upi), a way for banks to transfer money directly to one another based on a single identifier, such as the aadhar number.take the way that credit-card payments are processed: when you present your card to a store, the cashier verifies your signature and transmits your credit-card information to a billing processor such as visa, american express or mastercard - which works with the sending and receiving banks. the billing processors act as a custodian and clearing house. in return for this service, they charge the merchants a fee of 2 to 3 percent of the transaction. this is a tax that is indirectly passed on to the customer.with a system such as upi, the billing processor is eliminated, and transaction costs are close to zero. the mobile phone and a personal identification number take the place of the credit card as the authentication factor. all you do is to download a free app and enter your identification number and bank pin, and you can instantly transfer money to anyone - regardless of which bank he or she uses.there is no technology barrier to prevent a upi from working in the united states. transfers would happen within seconds, even faster than the 10 minutes that a bitcoin transaction takes.india has just introduced another innovation called india stack. this is a series of secured and connected systems that allow people to store and share personal data such as addresses, bank statements, medical records, employment records and tax filings, and it enables the digital signing of documents. the user controls what information is shared and with whom, and electronic signature occurs through biometric authentication.googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display(""adslotnativevideo""); });take the example of opening a mobile-phone account. it is cumbersome everywhere, because the telecom carriers need to verify the user's identity and credit history. in india, it often took days to produce all the documents that the government required. with the new ""know-your-customer"" procedures that are part of india stack, all that is needed is a thumb print or retina scan, and an account can be opened within minutes. the same can be done for medical records. imagine being able to share these with doctors and clinics as and when necessary. this is surely possible for us in the united states, but we aren't doing it because no trusted central authority has stepped up to the task.india stack will also transform how lending is done. the typical villager currently has no chance of getting a small-business loan, because he or she lacks a credit history and verifiable credentials. now people can share information from their digital lockers, such as bank statements, utility bill payments and life insurance policies, and loans can be approved almost instantaneously on the basis of verified data. this is a more open system than the credit0scoring services that u.s. businesses use.in november, in a move to curb corruption and eliminate counterfeit bills, indian prime minister narendra modi shocked the country by announcing the discontinuation of all 500- and 1,000-rupee (about $7 and $14) notes - which account for roughly 86 percent of all money in circulation. the move disrupted the entire economy, caused pain and suffering, and was widely criticized. yet it was a bold move that will surely produce long-term benefit, because it will accelerate the push to digital currency and the modernization of the indian economy.nobel prize-winning economist joseph stiglitz said at the world economic forum meeting in davos, switzerland, that the united states should follow modi's lead in phasing out currency and moving toward a digital economy, because it would have ""benefits that outweigh the cost."" speaking of the inequity and corruption that is becoming an issue in the united states and all over the world, he said: ""i believe very strongly that countries like the united states could and should move to a digital currency so that you would have the ability to trace this kind of corruption. there are important issues of privacy, cybersecurity, but it would certainly have big advantages.""we are not ready to become a cashless society, but there are many lessons that silicon valley and the united states can learn from the developing world.wadhwa is a professor at carnegie mellon university engineering at silicon valley and a director of research at center for entrepreneurship and research commercialization at duke.© 2017 the washington post(except for the headline, this story has not been edited by ndtv staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)",0.1093002431358596,silicon valley learn india ' moves toward less-cash,"silicon valley fancies global leader innovation. leaders hype technologies bitcoin blockchain , claim greatest inventions since internet. complex mathematicians understand , require massive computing resources operate - yet billions dollars invested them.india may leapfrogged u.s. technology industry simple practical innovations massive grunt work. built digital infrastructure soon process billions transactions bitcoin ever has. , india skip two generations financial technologies build something monumental china ' great wall america ' interstate highways.a decade ago , india massive problem : nearly half people form identification. born village without hospitals government services , ' get birth certificate.

2017-04-06,aadhaar exposed 4 lakh 'ghosts' in mid-day meals? claims may not add up,"new delhi: soon after the ministry of human resource development (hrd) issued a notification making aadhaar card mandatory for accessing mid-day meals, it released data claiming that thanks to aadhaar, four lakh 'ghost' or duplicate students enrolled with the state education department had been detected.this discovery was used to bolster the government's defence that aadhaar can help curb corruption in the school lunch scheme, and ward off criticism from critics who argue that the move is both illegal, and impractical.a closer look suggests that the government's claims do not quite add up.of the four lakh non-existent students discovered, two lakhs are from jharkhand and a similar number from andhra pradesh. both states have covered nearly their entire student population with aadhaar; the discovery of these 'ghosts' was the result of that exercise, say state government officials.but when we checked with officials in education department in ranchi, they could offer no direct evidence that these 'ghost' children were illegally consuming mid-day meals in government schools.mukesh kumar, state project director for sarva shiksha abhiyan said that the two lakh duplicate names were discovered as part of an exercise conducted to track children who had enrolled in both government and private schools.this is a common practice in india where increasingly children are shifting to a rapidly proliferating network of private schools, which in some cases may be unrecognised. as a back-up option, parents retain their admission in government schools.private schools allow this, since a higher student body gives them greater chance of acquiring recognition.""there are so many unrecognized schools, so in the village and panchayat nowadays they are going to impress and attract students, so chances of duplication and manipulation are there,"" said mr kumar. this poses a genuine challenge to india's public (and private) school system, but it's unclear how the discovery will reduce corruption in mid-day meal scheme.some students, says mr kumar, may be using the duplication to wrongly avail benefits of government schemes, like free uniforms, books or even free school lunches. he admits, though, there is no proof of how many are freeloaders.a visit to a government middle school in marda block, 40 kilometers from ranchi, whose records have thrown up three children of the two lakh ghosts underlines that reasons for duplication may be much more mundane.vibhakar mishr, principal of the school says two of the three students had simply moved to other schools and their names have been struck off from the register. that shift, however, may not have been logged in the system. the third student had transferred to the marda school from a different school three years ago; that school has yet to eliminate his name from the records.mr mishr says there is no question of school demanding funds for mid-day meals for students that have left it.""when a child comes in, attendance is taken accordingly and only then the required amount of food is made for mid-day meal. one child cannot take food from two places; neither can he or she give attendance in two places,"" he said. googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display(""adslotnativevideo""); });the centre, however is dismissive of these examples, persisting with its claims that state's exaggerate school enrollment to extract more funds for the scheme. again, the numbers belie this. jharkhand, for instance, demands mid-day meals funds for only 54 per cent of children enrolled in school.nationally, 20 per cent of enrolled children - that is three crores in all - are not served school lunches.reetika khera, professor at iit-delhi told ndtv that this does not indicate that states are significantly inflating enrolment numbers. ""if the state government wanted to embezzle funds, then it would have shown 100 per cent expenditure. but the fact that the states are reporting only 80 per cent or 76 per cent, it suggests that the states are not padding these numbers,"" the professor said.in andhra pradesh, which has also found two lakh 'ghost' entries via aadhaar, the reasons appear to be the same - children enrolled in private and government schools.an audit of the mid-day meal scheme commissioned by the state government found that the main problem was not duplicate entries.the main problem with mid-day meals, explains sowmya kidambi, director, society for social audit, accountability and transparency - a hyderabad-based government body which conducted the audit - was poor quality of food being fed to children under the scheme.""diversion of grains, issues of honorarium and salaries not being paid on time to the cook and helpers, their inability to buy vegetables or to be able to get any kind of credit that is required to feed so many children, were bigger issues,"" said kidambi.asked how registering children under aadhaar will help resolve this, ms kidambi said, laughingly, she ""doesn't know.""moreover, even if aadhaar is able to eliminate some degree of ghosts from mid-day meals, it's unclear if those gains outweigh the risk posed by its patchy implementation.in a number of states, the use of aadhaar to deliver government benefits, like subsidised food have been bedevilled by issues of last mile connectivity.in jharkhand, only two districts are experimenting with the use of aadhaar to deliver government handouts, and here too officials accept there are problems.""there are issues like infrastructural constraints. sometimes connectivity is a big issue, we are trying to resolve these problems also,"" said kumar.until these wrinkles are ironed out, is it fair to insist that children's meals are linked to a still evolving technology, all the more when its benefits remain unclear?",0.12106060606060608,aadhaar exposed 4 lakh ' ghosts ' mid-day meals ? claims may add,"new delhi : soon ministry human resource development ( hrd ) issued notification making aadhaar card mandatory accessing mid-day meals , released data claiming thanks aadhaar , four lakh ' ghost ' duplicate students enrolled state education department detected.this discovery used bolster government ' defence aadhaar help curb corruption school lunch scheme , ward criticism critics argue move illegal , impractical.a closer look suggests government ' claims quite add up.of four lakh non-existent students discovered , two lakhs jharkhand similar number andhra pradesh. states covered nearly entire student population aadhaar ; discovery ' ghosts ' result exercise , say state government officials.but checked officials education department ranchi , could offer direct evidence ' ghost ' children illegally consuming mid-day meals government schools.mukesh kumar , state project director sarva shiksha abhiyan said two lakh duplicate names discovered part exercise conducted track children enrolled government private schools.this common practice india increasingly children shifting rapidly proliferating network private schools , cases may unrecognised. back-up option , parents retain admission government schools.private schools allow , since higher student body gives greater chance acquiring recognition.

2017-08-24,foreign media on supreme court saying privacy is intrinsic right,"new delhi: in a blow to the indian government's efforts to roll out the world's biggest biometric database on its billion citizens, india's supreme court ruled thursday that privacy was a fundamental right for people.over the past few years, the government has aggressively pushed to compile the database, known as aadhaar, by sending officials out to remote villages to take iris scans and fingerprints. to ensure complete enrollment, the government this year put out several notices restricting access to essential government services for those not part of the system.the unanimous ruling by the nine-judge bench will have huge implications in a number of ongoing cases involving aadhaar, which means base or foundation in hindi. it could put an end to the government's efforts of making enrollment mandatory. it also guarantees privacy for indian citizens as an intrinsic right - removing it could have had far reaching implications beyond biometric ids for the daily lives of indians.though the full implications of the ruling will only be understood after further decisions from the court, activists say the court's message to the government is loud and clear: ""this judgment says that the people of this country have rights, in case you've forgotten,"" said usha ramanathan, an independent law researcher and activist speaking over the phone.with the right to privacy now guaranteed, opponents of aadhaar expect favorable rulings on petitions against the governments efforts to make enrollment mandatory.the government says that aadhaar is crucial for better governance and can save indian taxpayers billions of rupees by reducing welfare and tax fraud. in court, government lawyers argued that the right of all citizens to a dignified life was more important than the elitist preoccupation with privacy.but activists say that such an extensive collection of data is prone to leaks and misuse, endangering privacy for a sixth of the world's population.in extraordinary hearings, government lawyers dredged up old rulings to argue that indians did not have a fundamental right to privacy. ""it's a very dramatic thing when a government goes to court and says that,"" said ramanathan. ""it sets the government against the people.""googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display(""adslotnativevideo""); });in recent months, government notices said that as part of the aadhar program, indians would have to use a 12-digit unique identification number (known as the uid) in order to participate in almost every aspect of civic life - filing income tax returns, applying for railway jobs or opening bank accounts.government rules especially targeted the poorest and most vulnerable sections of society, ramanathan said, by restricting access to services such as free midday meals and allowances for tuberculosis patients.unlike social security numbers, uids would be accessible to various government agencies and private organizations. in recent months, government websites have mistakenly leaked thousands of uids.""they want a system where you'd have to enter that number to get basic things you were entitled to, where you'd have to give your thumbprint to get your rations, your wages which you'd worked for, or pensions for the elderly,"" ramanathan said.reetika khera, an economist at the indian institute of technology delhi said that the government could potentially use aadhaar as a surveillance program. ""they will be able to say for example that i went on the train from delhi to jharkhand, where i got off, withdrew so much cash, then went to forest of mahuadanr and conclude that she must be funding naxalites [an insurgent rebel group] whereas i've actually gone to supervise research in the forest."" the government's plan if fully implemented, she said, would treat every indian citizen as a potential criminal.
