2015-07-17,india's e-vault to store documents on cloud draws crowds,"bengaluru: a key part of the ""digital india"" initiative of prime minister narendra modi, the free government scheme that provides a virtual vault in cyberspace for the safe-keep of documents like birth certificates and property papers has attracted 830,075 people.as easy as opening an e-mail account, the free digital locker facility on a cloud, or cyberspace, allows any individual with an adhaar card and a linked mobile phone to sign up. it's a personal storage space to securely store e-documents and links of such official certificates.""one of the aims of 'digital india' is that a person should have private space on a public cloud. it is one of the desirable deliverables of this initiative,"" ram sewak sharma, secretary in the department of information technology, told ians in an interview.""a digital locker account is a convenient way of storing certificates in a digitised format. a person can then conveniently see his/her certificates online. various agencies will also be able to push documents into the locker. these can also be shared electronically,"" sharma said.a ""cloud"" in computer jargon can be described as a network of servers that is hosted on the internet rather than on the local server of individuals or organisations, allowing a much larger space to store data, and higher speeds to manage and process the same, in a cost-effective manner.each aadhaar-linked digital locker, which is hosted on such a cloud by the indian government , comes with 1-gb of free memory space. the locker has five components: ""my certificates"", ""my profile"", ""my issuer"", ""my requester"" and ""directories"".""a person has a number of certificates issued to him -- for education, birth, property. when they are digitally stored, it decreases administrative overheads of the government. there will also be less fraud. whatever you submit, you will be held responsible,"" sharma said.""if a document is found to be forged you cannot deny it,"" added sharma.""from a citizen's perspective, it reduces the hassle of carrying physical documents. suppose i have a digital locker and there is an agency which has issued a certificate in my name. there is a provision to push that certificate into the digital locker of the individual.""giving an example, the top official said: ""if a class xii certificate is issued to a person with a 'digital locker' it will have a link. this link can be shared. so wherever this certificate is submitted, it can be verified. one knows it is genuine. for the government, it is a great advantage.""since aadhaar is unambiguous, the first stage of a person's authentication is already done.""this kind of infrastructure was unique to india and the government wanted to leverage that, said sharma, adding that the potential could be guaged by the fact that more than 850 million unique identification numbers (aadhaar) had thus far been issued to people.so far, the 830,075 people who have signed up for the service have uploaded 430,324 documents. maharashtra has the highest subscribers with maharashtra 88,091 accounts, uttar pradesh is next with 79,499, followed by west bengal with 74,453.""even the american social security number does not have a biometric database,"" he said.

2015-09-27,"full text of pm modi's speech at digital india event in san jose, california","san jose: prime minister narendra modi addresed a digital india event in san jose in california.here is the full text of his speech: i am sure this was not pre-arranged. but, here on stage you see a perfect picture of india-u.s. partnership in the digital economy.good evening, everyone!if there was ever a gathering under one roof that could claim to be shaping the world, it is this. and, i am not talking about those in public office, here or in india! it's a great pleasure to be here in california. it is one of the last places in the world to see the sun set. but, it is here that new ideas see the first light of the day.it's a great honour that you have joined us tonight. i have met many of you in delhi and new york, and on facebook, twitter and instagram.these are the new neighborhoods of our new world.if facebook were a country, it would be the third most populous one and the most connected.google today has made teachers less awe-inspiring and grandparents more idle. twitter has turned everyone into a reporter. the traffic lights that need to work the best are on cisco routers.the status that now matters is not whether you are awake or asleep, but whether you are online or offline. the most fundamental debate for our youth is the choice between android, ios or windows.from computing to communication, entertainment to education, from printing documents to printing products, and, now to internet of things, it's been a long journey in a short time.from cleaner energy to better healthcare and safer transport, everything is converging around the work you do.in africa, it's helping people transfer money on phone. it has made reaching small island states no longer a journey of adventure, but a convenient click of a mouse.in india, a mother in a distant hill village has a better chance to save her new born infant. a child in a remote village has better access to education.a small farmer is more confident about his land holding and getting better market price. a fisherman on the sea has a better catch. and, a young professional in san francisco can skype daily to comfort her sick grandmother in india.an initiative by a father in haryana for ""selfie with daughter"" to draw attention to the girl child became an international movement.all this is because of the work you people are doing. since my government came to office last year, we have attacked poverty by using the power of networks and mobile phones to launch a new era of empowerment and inclusion: 180 million new bank accounts in a few months; direct transfer of benefits to the poor; funds for the unbanked; insurance within the reach of the poorest; and, pension for the sunset years for all.by using space technology and internet, we have been able to identify in the last few months 170 applications that will make governance better and development faster.when a small craftsman in a village in india brings a smile to a customer looking at his phone on a metro ride in new york; when a heart patient in a remote hospital in kyrgyz republic is treated by doctors sitting in delhi, as i saw in bishkek, we know we are creating something that has fundamentally changed our lives.the pace at which people are taking to digital technology defies our stereotypes of age, education, language and income. i like recounting my meeting with a group of unlettered tribal women in a remote part of gujarat. they were present at a local milk chilling plant i was inaugurating. they were using cell phones to take photographs of the event. i asked them what they would do with the images. the answer was a surprise for me.they said,they would go back, have the images downloaded on to a computer and take printouts. yes, they were familiar with the language of our digital world.and, farmers in maharashtra state have created a whatsapp group to share information on farming practices.customers, more than creators, are defining the use of a product. the world may be driven by the same ancient impulses. we will continue to see human struggles and successes. we will witness human glory and tragedies.but, in this digital age, we have an opportunity to transform lives of people in ways that was hard to imagine just a couple of decades ago.this is what sets us apart from the century that we have just left behind. there may be still some who see the digital economy as the tool of the rich, educated and the privileged. but, ask the taxi driver or the corner vendor in india what he has gained from his cell phone, and the debate gets settled. i see technology as a means to empower and as a tool that bridges the distance between hope and opportunity. social media is reducing social barriers. it connects people on the strength of human values, not identities.today, technology is advancing citizen empowerment and democracy that once drew their strength from constitutions. technology is forcing governments to deal with massive volume of data and generate responses, not in 24 hours but in 24 minutes.when you think of the exponential speed and scale of expansion of social media or a service, you have to believe that it is equally possible to rapidly transform the lives of those who have long stood on the margins of hope. so, friends out of this conviction was born the vision of digital india.it is an enterprise for india's transformation on a scale that is, perhaps, unmatched in human history. not just to touch the lives of the weakest, farthest and the poorest citizen of india, but change the way our nation will live and work.for nothing else will do in a country with 800 million youth under the age of 35 years, impatient for change and eager to achieve it.we will transform governance, making it more transparent, accountable, accessible and participative. i spoke of e-governance as a foundation of better governance - efficient, economical and effective.i now speak of m-governance or mobile governance. that is the way to go in a country with one billion cell phones and use of smart phones growing at high double digit rates. it has the potential to make development a truly inclusive and comprehensive mass movement. it puts governance within everyone's reach.after mygov.in, i have just launched the narendra modi mobile app. they are helping me stay in close touch with people. i learn a great deal from their suggestions and complaints.we want to free our citizens from the burden of excessive paper documents in every office. we want paperless transactions. we will set up a digital locker for every citizen to store personal documents that can be shared across departments.we have set up ebiz portal to make approvals for businesses and citizens easy and efficient so that they concentrate their energy on their goals, not on government processes.we are using technology to impart scale and speed to development.information, education, skills, healthcare, livelihood, financial inclusion, small and village enterprises, opportunities for women, conservation of natural resources, distributed clean energy - entirely new possibilities have emerged to change the development model.but for all this, we must bridge the digital divide and promote digital literacy in the same way that we seek to ensure general literacy.we must ensure that technology is accessible, affordable, and adds value.we want our 1.25 billion citizens to be digitally connected. we already have broadband usage across india go up by 63% last year. we need to accelerate this further.we have launched an aggressive expansion of the national optical fibre network that will take broadband to our 600,000 villages. we will connect all schools and colleges with broadband. building i-ways are as important as highways.we are expanding our public wi-fi hotspots. for example, we want to ensure that free wi fi is not only there in airport lounges, but also on our railway platforms. teaming up with google, we will cover 500 railway stations in a short time.we are also setting up common service centres in villages and towns. we will also use information technology to build smart cities.and, we want to turn our villages into smart economic hubs and connect our farmers better to markets and makes them less vulnerable to the whims of weather.for me, access also means that content should be in local languages. in a country with 22 official languages, it is a formidable, but an important task.affordability of products and services is critical for our success. there are many dimensions to this. we will promote manufacture of quality and affordable products in india. that is part of our vision of make in india, digital india and design in india.as our economy and our lives get more wired, we are also giving the highest importance to data privacy and security, intellectual property rights and cyber security.and,i know to achieve the vision of digital india, the government must also start thinking a bit like you.so, from creating infrastructure to services, from manufacture of products to human resource development, from support governments to enabling citizens and promoting digital literacy, digital india is a vast cyber world of opportunities for you.the task is huge; the challenges are many. but, we also know that we will not reach new destinations without taking new roads.much of india that we dream of is yet to be built. so, we have the opportunity to shape its path now.and, we have the talent, enterprise and skills to succeed.we also have the strength of the partnership between india and the united states.indians and americans have worked together to shape the knowledge economy. they have made us aware of the vast potential of technology.from large corporate to young professionals in this great centre of innovation, each can be part of the digital india story.the sustainable development of one-sixth of humanity will be a major force of good for our world and our planet.today, we speak of india-u.s. partnership as a defining partnership of this century. it hinges on two major reasons. both converge here in california.we all know that the dynamic asia pacific region will shape the course of this century. and, india and the united states, the world's two largest democracies, are located at the two ends of this region.we have the responsibility to shape a future of peace, stability and prosperity in this region.our relationship is also defined by the power of youth, technology and innovation. these can ignite a partnership that will advance and sustain prosperity in our two countries.even more, in this digital age, we can draw on the strength of our values and partnership to shape a better and more sustainable future for the world.

2015-09-29,turning your company digital in india," google, facebook, amazon, uber and airbnb. flipkart, inmobi, snapdeal, if we are talking from an indian context. whenever conversations veer to great, innovative, highly-valued companies, these are the names that inevitably come up. the business newspapers, influential blogs, myriad tweet-streams and the conference-seminar talking heads - they all gush about how these companies are changing the world around us, and how they are redefining management and business-model paradigms.all this and more is true. however, when you look a little closely at these entities, you realise that all of these companies are technology-based, digital companies. if you look a little more closely, you will realise that these companies were so from the day they were born: what i call the born digital companies.they have known no other existence. from day zero, their products have been digital in nature - apps, websites, ecommerce. whatever part is physical (goods delivered, salesforces, etc.), is all digitally-enabled. all customer interfaces are primarily digital - whether be on the web, or the phone, or across any other device. physical or voice interfaces are resolutely avoided (when was the last time you spoke to a google customer service agent?). the processes supporting these companies operations have been digital from day zero: apps for sales forces, digital payments, virtually no paper. short, crisp processes with huge empowerment, and artificial intelligence and algorithms baked in from the very beginning. significantly, the business models are digital too: ecommerce, saas, freemium, ad-supported, bitcoins... there are hardly any physical assets: the companies seem to be based in the cloud, or as a token to physicality, sprawled across prime acreage in the valley. most importantly, the people who founded and comprised these companies are true blue digital natives: young, hoodie-clad, algorithm-spouting college dropouts with smartphones as natural extensions of their arms; people who could code before they could converse.these companies dominate our conversations and our mind-spaces; the fact is that they are a tiny though very influential part of the global economy, the apocryphal 1%. however, much like in the occupy wall street famed movement, there is the other 99%. these are the 'real' or the 'old' economy companies: behemoths like walmart and gm and boeing and ge. big pharma, big finance, the mining and agricultural giants, the gigantic oil companies and the shipping giants.they are different. their products are physical and tangible - many times, you can pick them up and smell them. in many cases, the processes which power their operations are 'legacy', having existed for decades, but with incremental improvements done to them every year. their digital customer interfaces, while highly sophisticated, are secondary to their physical touchpoints - the stores, the factories, the warehouses. the business models are usually traditional and very profitable. the people are traditional too - experienced managers and leaders, great mbas and highly-educated phds.here, if you look closely, you find one common thing: most of them want to become digital. many of them, in fact, have started on this journey, a very few of them have transformed themselves digitally and have now the best of both worlds - the physical and the digital have melded seamlessly into each other to create a new, powerful hybrid - the 'phygital' company.this is what omnichannel in retail is all about, where the customer experiences a seamless, continuous interface between her phone, pc, the actual store, and the ipads in the store. the actual fulfilment can be at the store, or at home, or at a pickup point. at the backend, the entire inventory, offers, pricing, displays are all the same, irrespective of the medium. macys, crate and barrel, walmart are leading the charge here. phygital is what starbucks has done: gotten in a chief digital officer, who has stitched up the physical and digital experiences seamlessly. so has burberry: before angela ahrendts, the erstwhile ceo and now apple retail queen, not a single luxury brand embraced digital, fearing that the experience will not match up to the store. she changed all that, and made the brand appeal to the younger, digital-savvy crowd while retaining the exclusivity, and the pricing. even the quintessential old-world colossus like ge has embraced the digital world.as its engines power thousands of aircrafts across the skies, they keep on sending every conceivable piece of data back to the server clouds - the temperature, the rpm, the power, the turbulence, airstream data, and the second -by-second fuel utilization. ge's analytics engines analyse the data in real time, and figure out the most efficient way for the engine to run, and thus have saved billions of dollars of fuel for their customers. nike has done this very well - mated a conventional shoe to a fitness band and created running histories and data profiles for their customers. the big hotel chains have embraced digital, with in-app room selection, keyless entry using a mobile phone, ai-powered dynamic pricing and a thousand other ways.a few companies in india are embracing the digital world too. tata housing now sells hundreds of houses online on property aggregator sites. asian paints has been at the forefront, quietly digitizing their supply chain and their sales forces, making it extremely nimble and cost-efficient. at the mahindra group itself, mom&me has merged with babyoye, the online baby etailer, and now renamed the entire company babyoye. m2all.com is a superstore of all products of the mahindra group. each company in the group is running multiple pilots - creating digital products, mobility presences, experimenting with disruptive digital business models.becoming digital is not only about creating an app or a website, or even a new digital product. it is not only about embracing ecommerce, or a cloud-based saas-enabled crm (customer relationship management). it is about a wholesale, long-term change, a journey which will take three to five years, and will perhaps never end. it is a continuous change process of reacting to customer needs on a daily basis, and of always staying one step ahead of the competition. what the digital transformation does is that it makes a company react and change very fast, and achieve new product-market fits almost instantaneously.changing the customer interface is just the visible 5% of the effort - the real grunt work is at the backend. it is about digitally-enabling processes and simplifying them considerably. it is about piloting new digital business models and completely new ways to make money. it is sometimes about upending organisation structures, and getting in new people with new skills.the companies which transform themselves are like the brahmins - the twice born. the most successful example of this brahmanism is the most highly-valued, most-admired and the most profitable company in the entire world. it was born as another gadget-selling company, and it successfully sold a large number of computers through physical stores. it did not change, and did not embrace the new world, and it almost died. it was then resurrected and transformed, and has come back as the biggest purveyor of digital goods, with global digital platforms powering them, seamlessly sold through digital and offline stores which look, feel and act exactly the same. the company we are talking about is apple, and few people realise how rooted it is in the digital world, and how almost everything that it does is digitally enabled. the stickiness of the iphones and ipads has to do more with the app store and itunes than with its gorilla glass and the burnished aluminium backs. it is the seamlessness of the experience between digital and physical which still makes thousands of people line up outside their stores and buy the latest overpriced offering.and as you stand there, waiting for your turn, do remember that this is what a digital transformation of your own physical company can do.(jaspreet bindra is the svp -

2015-11-16,"decoding harisal, india's first soon-to-be 'smart village'","mumbai: on the state highway to melghat, you will not find harisal on milestones or road signs, not even when you are just 10 km away. it comes up suddenly - a cluster of houses, a prominent blue bank of maharashtra board, and a fading green sign that says 'harisal', which is a ""medium-sized village"" as the 2011 census described ituntil a couple of months back, harisal was a nondescript adivasi settlement left to its devices. now, it is all set to become the first ""smart village"" in the country, and ""online"" is the buzzword here, a magical string of syllables on the lips of its 1,479 residents.the buzz started on september 14, when the village received rather unusual visitors - microsoft india head prashant shukla, district collector kiran gitte and the cmo's it chief kaustubh dhawase - as a rite of initiation into the mothership called digital india.two weeks ago, maharashtra chief minister devendra fadnavis, who had visited the village last year, announced at microsoft's future unleashed event that harisal will be the first-of-its-kind ""smart village"".""technology will be the means to solve problems of health, education, skill development and employment,"" as collector gitte puts it. mobile connectivity, a wi-fi zone, a digital centre, cashless markets, health cards and telemedicine are on the agenda to transform harisal, according to officials.kaustubh dhavse, officer on special duty (it) in the chief minister's office, told mid-day, ""the idea of village smartness was the cm's concept to bring villages to the mainstream. the region has all core infrastructures in place but the people need to be made aware of the benefits they can derive from it.he added that harisal was an ideal place as most of population had smart phones and television sets that connected them with the world outside. but over at harisal, villagers draw our attention to a lone bulb that barely lights the readymade clothes shop.the village faces severe load-shedding - six hours in the night and eight hours during the day - and even when there is power, it is just enough for a low-wattage bulb. running televisions at home and motor pumps in the field invite strict reprimands; villagers say there is no water supply.jayshree kharve, an asha worker at one of the three aanganwadis in the village, said the things the aanganwadi needs the most are a compound wall, water supply, and pensions for the workers - none of which are to do with technology.in fact, looking back at dhavse's remarks, it looks like harisal will only now really get the so-called ""core infrastructure"" under the digital india plank. the sarpanch bhau chipu dhikar, an adivasi from the melghat's predominant korku tribe, believes ""online"" will be the doorway into ""sukh suvidha"" (comfort and amenities).the quiet ex-forester does not own a mobile phone and has never seen a computer. for him, digital india is ""something the american sarkar has brought to india.""thanks to digital india, dhikar is optimistic that his village will become more like a city, and that his sons, who are high-school pass-outs, will get a steady employment rather than farming.another villager, deepak nagle, 28, is one of the 14 members in an all-male nodal committee of villagers formed under the smart village plan. nagle will be trained in computer basics, and will in turn teach other villagers.nagle, who stopped at high school, works as a driver, shunting between harisal and parathwada, the nearest developed centre at the foothills of melghat.he has a mobile phone number, but with no way to charge his phone, it is pretty pointless. nagle has other pressing concerns too.the nearest undergraduate college is in dharni, 26 kms away, so pursuing engineering or medicine is not an option for every harisal student. buses do not ply frequently into harisal either.""there are new technologies in education that we can be part of if we have internet. microsoft has already mapped our houses using gps, and soon farmers will be able to ask their queries online,"" he says.power strugglewhile these ideas look great on paper, electricity is a major issue for harisal. the town dharni, which is also the taluka under which harisal falls, has 24x7 power supply.so does the neighbouring hill-station of chikladhara, a tourist destination. but in harisal, the bank, fitted with an inverter and solar panels, is an anomaly. the most solar energy that is domestically used in melghat is in the form of lanterns, provided by the forest department.dhikar says, ""we have been conducting morchas and fighting the load-shedding problem for the last four years. we had electricity supply before that; but with decreasing ground water levels and an increase in the number of bore-wells, we started facing this problem."" another villager chimes in, ""but families here still get a monthly electricity bill of rs 400.""asked about this, collector gitte said power supply will soon be directed from nepanagar in madhya pradesh. sources on the ground, however, added that these talks have been on for over a year without any results.gitte and officer dhavse added bsnl has finished laying fibre optic cables and indus will erect a mobile tower (even as one installed by reliance stands defunct) right outside the panchayat office in a month's time.dhavse, who has worked for top corporate companies before joining team fadnavis, said the information highway would be ready for transmission anytime soon.more than just digitisationat the future unleashed event in mumbai, fadnavis - speaking in the presence of microsoft boss satya nadella - said: ""the lack of nutrition, coupled with genetic health problems, and the lifestyle of people have to be changed to make it more healthy and connected with the mainstream.""district health department figures show the dharni taluka in melghat recorded 158 deaths under the age of one just in april and may, though villagers don't make much of it. the deputy sarpanch ganpat babuji gayan, in fact, claimed malnutrition figures have come down considerably in the past few years.vandana krishna, director general for the rajamata jijau mission, explained harisal's attitude thus: ""local people have become cynical. melghat has been so over-exposed as a malnutrition centre that villagers have reached a saturation point.after all, melghat is not the only hotspot. gadchiroli, pockets of nashik, and nandurbar are more backward, but with fewer ngos operating in these places.""in 1996-97, the area recorded more than 1000 deaths under the age of six, as compared to 2013-14, when a little more than 400 deaths have been seen.explaining how digitization will help curb these deaths, collector gitte said, ""while child mortality rates have been on the decline with the help of anganwadis, midday meals, etc, it is still a challenge to bring down infant mortality rates (imr). the challenge is to bring pregnant mothers well in time to hospitals and not lose them during transportation.""baby warmers in ambulances, mobile-connectivity for ambulances and tele-medicine are some of the ways by which the smart village will combat imr and (maternal mortality rate) mmr, he said.while harisal gets its fair share of basics along with digitization, the plan is that 51 smaller villages within a 15 km radius will benefit from this. gitte added that locals will be taught improved farming techniques using digitally-accessed advice in weather patterns, soil quality with the aiming of increasing the output of soybean and tendu leaves, which is used to make beedis.dr ashish satav heads ngo mahan, established in 1998 to improve health for adivasis in melghat. he said technology against malnutrition will work only with the right human intervention.in a report he co-authored in may, satav recommended home-based child care, preventing under-reporting of malnutrition cases, building child development centers and nutritious kitchens.satav also said newer diseases like tuberculosis and heart attacks were on the rise in the community and that digital initiatives should look at ways to tackle these, too.similarly, krishna said the greatest boon digitization can offer the village is to take aanganwadi reports online. currently, the reports show mere numbers, and have no details. ""the reports do not tell you what is happening to each child but show bulk figures. digitising records will help us to track the progress of each child, make comparisons, and minimise the under-reporting that is predominant in these records.""satav added that while it is good to focus on harisal, some of the other worse-off villages should not be forgotten. ""harisal, with its phc and an ambulance on call, is not the worst off among villages with malnutrition in melghat,"" said satav. ""it is on the highway and has access to health amenities. kokmar, a hamlet 25 kms away from harisal, on the other hand, has seen the worst of inaccessibility to basic healthcare.""substandard delivery kits (which include razors and sickles), diarrhea-related deaths, misbeliefs regarding check-ups are predominant in kokmar.the korku tribe, say experts, have been a challenge to health workers, since they are particularly superstitious. the tribe usually resorts to witch-doctors and quacks, who dispense amulets and taveez.'jhaad-phoonk' is the first option; approaching the phc is the last. women have as many as 12 children. dr satav says, ""making a hamlet like kokmar, which has 14 kms of kaccha road, into a smart village will be the real success story. harisal is not the real representation of melghat.""the 30 houses in kokmar have a monthly income of less than rs 3000 and are mostly korku. harisal, on the other hand, is not your average adivasi village since it has several migrants, including marathi-speakers and muslims.""people from kokmar have no market facility, no buses and are exposed to quacks. there is absolutely no electricity. is harisal then a replicable model?"" asked satav.needed: smart solutionssome of the proposed technological initiatives have already been tried out with varying degrees of success. advocate purnima upadhyay, from ngo khoj, a voluntary organization in melghat, pointed to the failure of telemedicine in the semadoh, 24 kms away from harisal, and on the highway as well.about eight months before the fadnavis government came to power, the villagers were given telephonic access to doctors in urban areas, but with no mobile phone coverage, this plan died a quiet death. moreover, the medicines prescribed by the doctors were not stocked at the phc.""the top-down model is not going to work and the basics need to be improved. the ideal way to go about with digitization is to do is simultaneously in five villages, with different indicators and then analyse different success rates,"" she said. her colleague adv bandu sane added, ""instead of waiting for so long to bring in cellphone towers to enable calling ambulances, why weren't landline facilities made available years ago?""on paper, tele-medicine is a zero-cost solution, according to sam pitroda, who launched the centre for the development of telematics as part of a similar initiative by the rajiv gandhi government in the 1980s to take telecommunication to the country's farthest corners.""all you need is access to a qualified doctor. khatam,"" he said. what pitroda is wary of, however, in this ""reasonably sound plan"" is a tight handshake between the maharashtra government and microsoft. ""we don't want proprietary software. it should be open source, which people can further develop.instead of just hardware and software getting pumped into a village, we need ngos, activists, women, social scientists, anthropologists and psychologists to be part of this model. there has to be a balance between customization and standardization,"" he says.pitroda said connecting panchayats is the building block of digitization, but it then has to be planned well, both top-down and bottom-up. he uses the term interoperability - a way of making sure that various institutions are linked together.""the old ways of doing things have become obsolete, especially with the rise of social media. what do you think will happen if you put a whole village on facebook,"" he asked. admittedly, harisal is just a pilot project, based on the successes of which 11 more clusters will be digitized in the area.and pilot projects and experiments are great, says pitroda, as long as there is a ""tough understanding"" of the needs of rural maharashtra. ""a tribal may not know the possibilities of digitization, but he knows what he wants. if you spend rs 2 crore then what do people get?"" asked the telecom engineer.state speakkaustabh dhavse, officer on special duty (it) in the cmo and the nodal officer for the harisal project tells dharmendra jore how the government will transform the villageq. why harisal?a. harisal has the dubious distinction of being the malnutrition capital of maharashtra. it has very peculiar demographics.its social indexes are highly negative and despite being blessed with ample natural resources the area suffers from a plethora of issues.the issues are solvable and only require intent and government will. when we met the people of harisal, their steely resolve to work to fix the issues inspired us and made it the right choice.the cm believes that when an effort becomes people's movement its success is guaranteed. our strategy is similar to what we did in jalayukt shivar (rural water conservation programme).q. what changes can harisal expect in the coming months?a. 1) self-sufficient and sustainable village economy with enough resource creation, 2) bringing harisal people to the mainstream by providing them access to the information superhighway, 3) to bring the entire village on the banking system with 100% compliance to pm jan dhan yojana, 4) pds, education, phc, tribal/ebc (other backward class) benefits ecosystem will be created, 5) village gdp and socio economic growth quotient will be measured and monitored on periodic basis. efforts to drive it up will be taken. focus is to drive economic growth, and 6) skill development initiatives with mahakaushalya.comq. how will the digital india programme help put an end to malnutrition in harisal?a. malnutrition is a byproduct of a system that does not organise itself well to solve the issue. policies earlier were like band-aid. it never looked at the problem in detail to see what causes this menace. we were able to dwell deeper and basis data co-relate factors affecting health to impoverishment and ignorance. it is like a vicious cycle. malnutrition problem is similar to the farmers suicide issue. the problem is systemic. our design philosophy which primarily rests on driving up economic activity, empowering villagers and giving them clarity, literacy and access to govt services will kill this menace once and for all. several thousands of crores have been spent to drive away malnutrition without understanding the problem in detail. the issue when understood completely now is in the process of resolution.q. what kind of support is microsoft receiving from the maharashtra government?a. state and microsoft are in a partnership to make harisal the first digital village in the country. ms will invest capital and gom will provide all support. the day this is ready, it will become a national example. what technology can do to common lives and how it can solve complicated issues, our implementation will show.q. harisal does not have continuous power supply. how does the government think microsoft is going to deal with that?a. power will be continuous through renewable sources. there might be a short-term issue till we get our act together, once our core (conventional) and non-conventional power sources are in place, the village will shine like never before. villagers deserve to be part of the economic growth story. we are committed to deliver this to them.1,479population of harisal village in melghat in amravati district158malnutrition deaths in harisal in april and may1,000number of children below six who died in harisal in 1996-97. this has come down to 400 in 2013-14.rs 3,000the monthly average income of kokmar village, which is just 25 km from harisal ",0.09381847890671416,"decoding harisal , india ' first soon-to-be ' smart village '","mumbai : state highway melghat , find harisal milestones road signs , even 10 km away. comes suddenly - cluster houses , prominent blue bank maharashtra board , fading green sign says ' harisal ' , "" medium-sized village "" 2011 census described ituntil couple months back , harisal nondescript adivasi settlement left devices. , set become first "" smart village "" country , "" online "" buzzword , magical string syllables lips 1,479 residents.the buzz started september 14 , village received rather unusual visitors - microsoft india head prashant shukla , district collector kiran gitte cmo ' chief kaustubh dhawase - rite initiation mothership called digital india.two weeks ago , maharashtra chief minister devendra fadnavis , visited village last year , announced microsoft ' future unleashed event harisal first-of-its-kind "" smart village "" .

""especially since you're not restricting anyone from registering. we're democratizing the entire process.''biometric datafor 46-year-old rajesh kohli, who works for a delhi state hospital, buying on the website frees up time but raises fears of misuse of his biometric data.everyone using the portal is required to register their personal mobile phone numbers and aadhaar biometric cards. aadhaar, issued by the unique identification authority of india, captures personal details including fingerprints and iris scans. india's supreme court has prohibited the government from making the unique identity program mandatory and is currently hearing cases challenging its constitutionality.""the system requires a personal vouch. that scares us,'' said kohli.

2017-02-05,the bjp's social media armies seek to divide," this past week, i made a speech in parliament in response to the motion of thanks following the president's address. the president's address takes place at the beginning of the first session in a calendar year. it usually inaugurates the budget session and has the government, through the president, explaining its assessment of how the previous year has gone, and giving an idea of how it sees economic and developmental challenges in the near future.while the odd line in my speech may have hassled the hindutva hordes on twitter and social media, i'm happy to point out that the bulk of my text was not wasted on them and their vile propaganda. neither was it a personal attack on the prime minister or any individual in the government. it was a critique of the government's economic agenda and the social tensions it has unleashed. and a warning of what was going wrong with our country.the government is celebrating demonetisation. but it cannot ignore that at least 120 people have died as a direct consequence of demonetisation. take two of the several examples i used:sudarsin surin lives in marangabahal village in odisha. when his two-year-old son fell ill, he took him on his bicycle and rode seven km to reach meghapal hospital. once there, he was advised by the doctors to take his child to sambalpur hospital, another 40 km away, as the condition of the baby had deteriorated. a desperate father pleaded with auto-rickshaw drivers to take him to sambalpur, but they refused as he had only rs. 500 notes with him. after three hours, the child died. in uttar pradesh, suresh, an 18-year-old second-year b.sc student, hanged himself as he could not withdraw money from the bank to pay his college examination fees.the media has listed details of these 120 deaths. shouldn't the government acknowledge them? shouldn't parliament mourn these unsung martyrs of demonetisation, or should i call them sacrificial lambs?this is a government of gimmicks and pr, which is fine as long as it doesn't cause tragedies and bring misfortune to the lives of ordinary people. demonetisation is a perfect example of this mess. every second day since november 8, the government has changed its mind about the reason for demonetisation - unearthing black money, fighting terrorism, promoting digital payments, widening the tax net, boosting the real estate market.and despite all this, we still have no concrete numbers about the so-called black money that has been identified. we were told to wait till december 31. now we are told to wait till march 31. let's see if that deadline too is extended.amid this tamasha-baazi, india is losing time. the bjp government was elected in 2014 to solve some large and pressing problems. one of these related to the culture of crony capitalism that had sunk indian public sector banks. it was meant to crack down on the corrupt, get crony businessmen to pay up and rescue the banks. what has it done, other than allowing vijay mallya to escape? next to nothing. today, non-performing assets worth rs. 6 lakh crore have piled up in the banks (as of march 2016). the government has sanctioned a paltry rs. 10,000 crore for bank recapitalisation. are we supposed to hail this as an embodiment of achhe din?googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display(""adslotnativevideo""); });as it happens, the only party that has consistently attacked the government on economic issues is the trinamool congress. we have paid for it. central agencies have targeted bengal and arrested our party mps on trumped-up charges, without sufficient evidence. the social media armies of the bjp have systematically threatened religious harmony and social peace in bengal. i stressed this in the rajya sabha, explaining how ""digital india"" was being turned into ""divisive india"". the examples i gave should be scary and worrying for anybody in government. out of nothing, a twitter trend was created by manipulating timelines and using hashtags like '#bengalisburning'. a mischief-maker uses photoshop to concoct an incident and his cohorts ensure it goes viral. they pretend it is an organised religious attack. actually, it is a made-up case, a hoax.who is behind all this?

2017-06-02,"india is predominantly ready for digital classrooms, says tcs ion global head ramaswamy","new delhi: in recent years, india has seen a massive revolution toward adopting digital solutions in education and recruitment sectors. with the current government's focus on transforming the country into a digital hub, there is suddenly more emphasis toward transforming the entrance, recruitment and academic assessment processes. ndtv recently had the opportunity to speak to venguswamy ramaswamy, global head tcs ion. tcs ion is the platform for many recruitment, entrance, and academic assessment examinations which are being conducted in india. mr. ramaswamy graciously enlightened about the various aspects of digitalizing these sectors including the challenges encountered, benefits of such an endeavor and also helped dispel some common myths. q. how does digitalizing a school classroom help? is india ready for digital classrooms?it is very difficult to say whether india is ready because india is too big. but i should say that post the digital development given by the current government, india is predominantly ready for digital classroom for sure. several parts of india are now connected with fiber network and hence the country is absolutely ready. having said that there are still parts of north-east and the interior parts of country where there are still hurdles in making sure that digital classrooms are ready. but it is important to understand in this context what a digital classroom is all about. it is nothing but ability to access content on the job and having an infrastructure to use that in teaching a classroom, that's all there is. digital classroom is not something hypothetical which cannot be imagined. it just means a projector, a computer and a very strong network. so india is predominantly ready and we are seeing it in the most parts of the country. even in scenarios where we are having challenges, we work with the network operators. if this question was asked 2 years or 5 years back i would definitely have said that india was not ready but i believe that now india is very much ready for the transition. q. what are the factors involved when conducting a recruitment exam online?we do three kinds of assessments - academic competitive assessment (cat, gate, clat etc.), recruitment exams (police recruitment, high court recruitment etc.), and promotional exams (internal exams). there are five factors involved. one to conduct an online exam a robust, enabled digital platform is required. people use the word online but online means conducting exam on the internet. the exam is conducted on a computer and while exam is being conducted, a system cannot be connected to the internet. number two, you need high quality content which is nothing but questions and questions. large number of problems arises out of ambiguous nature of questions. because of this every student interprets questions differently. most of the questions which are asked today are memory-based than being application based in nature. third one is you need robust infrastructure. there are one crore candidates who have appeared for these exams in the past decade. you need that many computers in several shifts across the country. fourth one is a strong set of processing - processing the application, releasing the admit card, conducting the exam, processing and releasing the result, demonstrating the responses. so there is a strong set of processing required. because these assessments are conducted on a national level you need local people. we need people who will help conduct the examination at the local centres. these are the five components which are very critical to conducting a successful online examination.q. why is a computer-based test better than paper-based test apart from the obvious reason of preventing paper leak? do you believe the computer based exam glitch free from hacking and all?first of all i must tell you that it is a myth that a computer-based examination cannot be compromised. the reason being it is a human being who sets the question, it is not a computer. but having said that in a computer based test even though the question is being set and entered into the system by a human, nobody actually knows which question is going to be used in order to set the question paper. so the risk of paper leak is minimalized. but in a computer based test there are other set of issues for example, what happens when the exam is going on and the power goes off, what happens when the exam is going on and someone pulls the network cable or the router or the switch which connects all the computer systems at an exam centre goes bad. these are other kinds of glitches which can happen. however, if you have a very robust system and infrastructure we can reduce some of the obvious problems. for example tcs provides a diesel generator set at all the exam centres so that when the power goes off there is power backup immediately available. these are all things one has to do to conduct a successful exam. even after doing all of these things, if there is still a problem, what we do is start the exam at the same time, at the same level. q. what are the problems you face when conducting online exam for any vertical?there are three issues - power issue, network related breakdown, candidate disruption for example a candidate puts mobile inside his trouser and enters the exam hall or when exam is going on and candidate creates some noise because the exam paper is tough. there are processes and mechanisms to deal with all these things. q. what are the common mistakes, candidates make when appearing for an online exam? what should a candidate remember when appearing for an online exam?first of all the most number of candidates make the same mistake that is they don't bring proper identification documents to the exam centre. second is when the students give biometric they do not take proper care in giving biometric. while giving biometrics, you have to use your fingers properly and if not done properly, your prints would not match at a later stage. so candidates need to be very careful. the third thing is candidates are not tested for using a computer; they are tested for the subject knowledge. so they should practice the use of screen before they come for the exam and there are mock exams available for every exam conducted on the internet. every information is available. apart from this there is no such difference between online and offline exam. in fact in online exam you have much better flexibility as you can go to any question, correct any answer at any stage. in offline exam you do not have the flexibility to correct an answer which you have marked on the omr sheet. q. in your experience, how has the digital space changed for education and job recruitment? do you see any change in the old indian behavior of time taking recruitment process?this is a re-imagination which tcs has done. in the last few years of coming into this domain we thought to ourselves how should we disturb this whole process of recruitment and academic assessment and ensure high quality. what used to happen earlier, if a board decides to do recruitment exam they had to make a policy, they had to take approval from the competent authorities, then they have to do question paper discussion with a number of professors. all of them would prepare questions and send them to the board. they would get the questions typed and then give it to a printer. the printer would print it, and then the questions would be distributed into different question sets. meanwhile applications had to be collected, exam dates had to be declared, then exam had to be conducted then all the omr sheets had to be collected, scanned. then the output had to be evaluated and result to be generated. these were all the steps involved in the process. now, what has happened is everything is one the cloud, the question paper is on the cloud. everything is digital. there is no dispatching of the question paper for printing. those processes are gone. today, if a board wants, it can conduct the exam and publish the result in less than 30 days. having said that, even today a board takes longer time because of the transition and transformation that the country is going through. but ideally this process should get settled and we should see many government departments and any recruitment bodies declaring results at a rapid speed. for example ibps which conducts all the major banking recruitment exams is running on our platform. they declare the result very fast that is because of the digitization that has happened in the whole process of recruitment. the old behavior i won't say has completely changed but it is in the right direction. q. what are the projects you have undertaken in the field of education?googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display(""adslotnativevideo""); });we are the largest platform in the world in terms of the number of candidates we assess and currently we are assessing 30 million candidates on a year to year basis. our country has a huge number of assessments to be done and hence the opportunity is manifold. in the field of education, first of all, for every of our institute we are doing academic assessment like clat, gate and other such examinations. second we are very large in the space of learning. because we are digitizing the content and making the classroom a digital classroom or what we call as a hybrid classroom. we are doing lot of work in digitizing the entire education process from admission to academic to promotion to library to transportation to accounts to hr to finance; all of these aspects within education domain are being digitized. we are also doing a lot of projects on examination management right from announcing the exam, to collecting application, conducting the semester exam all these things are done by us as part of exam management process. then we are doing lot of work in providing the certificate in a digital form. so now many institutes issue digital certificates for example iim kozhikode issues digital certificates and this can be stored in your digital locker and anybody can verify it at any point in time. those are the kind of projects we are doing right now in the field of education. q. what are the expenses involved in digitalizing a classroom/conducting a computer-based exam? digitizing a classroom just needs a projector, a computer, a strong network and access to content. the expense depends upon how good a projector you have and how good and vast the content you want. in case of conducting a computer-based exam it is very easy these days. per candidate anywhere between 300 rs to 700 rs is spent and it is typically a percentage of student fee. it is very simple because all of those activities are done by tcs and the difference in the expense or a range is because some board may want biometrics, some board may want cctv, some board may want content for town planning, these are all personalized subjects. but it is all done on a model which requires only a percentage of the student fee. q. what measures do you take to ensure privacy of a candidate's data?first of all, there's no different setting for online exam and offline exam because in any exam they apply, it is called application management. there are many agencies which make a mistake of storing those data in an online concept form which is normally the mistake the agencies or the board does it. for example any data collected from a candidate is stored in an encrypted form. so when you store data in an encrypted form it is not possible for anybody to access it without crossing some security level. as long as they are doing it, there is no risk of data privacy breach. i recently read a story where data of students was available in return for cash. this is all happening because agencies are not encrypting data. q. what about the 'frisking guidelines'? how strictly do you follow it?first of all there is a large set of discussion which is going on about the frisking guidelines. there are two kinds of frisking which is done. first is frisking of the body parts in which case there is a separate enclosed area for females where the security personnel check if there is any item in their body which is not allowed in the exam centre for example a bluetooth device or a mobile phone. second these handheld devices which are used to check the candidates. that is another type of frisking. obviously the body parts are checked but there are certain places in a male and female body which one cannot pat. and today the candidates have become more sophisticated in hiding those devices on their body. then the frisking becomes weaker and such issues come up or controversies come up. due to religious beliefs for example you cannot ask a sikh candidate to remove their turban or there are certain caste and religions which have certain types of attire. these are some issues which are there and now board is looking to solving these issues one by one. what such candidates should do is come ahead of the exam time and should be willing to go through a detailed process of checking or frisking before they are allowed entry into the centre. we follow it strictly but i agree that in one of the locations there might be a lapse because we have to monitor strictly through processing and that's how it is done today. but we do have a strictly detailed process for frisking for each candidate including guidelines for how do you frisk a candidate from a certain religion or caste etc. these are the things which we advise our clients on. q. tcs-ion recently managed the clat exam and there were complaints from students about exam centre location and that the exam was not conducted in a fair manner. what do you have to say about it?if you take a city and take a look at the colleges in the city, there are colleges which are at the boundary of a city. the number of colleges which serve as a centre are very less and particularly the engineering colleges with proper infrastructure for conducting the exam are very less. if you want to conduct an online exam, you as a board need to be prepared to improve the standards of the nearby colleges to conduct the exam which is not going to happen overnight and this must be accepted as a fact. so when we conduct an exam we tell our clients how we will accommodate the students because the advantages of an online exam is very many and we need to adjust on certain issues.second is one of the success factors for an online exam is high quality content. in case of clat the conducting body cnlu decided to create the content themselves. so whatever i saw most of the controversy that is there in the media about clat exam is about the quality of the questions which was the onus of the conducting body.third for every candidate in every exam centre we have click by click log available so there is no question of anybody saying that it was not done in transparency because we can reproduce every click by the candidate in the court. in general you have to accept whenever a candidate believes that the exam was tough or the questions were ambiguous we have to manage accordingly. we are the only organization which provides rti support. if the need be we can reproduce click by click log for any candidate for the board, not for the candidate but for the board. so to answer your question, i believe that the exam was conducted in a fair manner. about tcs iontcs ion provides various digital platforms not only to education bodies but also provides self-learning assistance to students appearing for competitive examinations for higher studies and recruitment. it offers solutions for all educational processes such as digital campus, digital learning, digital exams, digital marking, in-course assessment, digital records, prep tests and digital assessments. tcs-ion has been working with multiple education bodies both at state and national level along with many known organisations for recruitment.

2018-03-26,"aadhaar was supposed to end welfare corruption, but neediest may be hit hardest","new delhi: it's been nearly three years since prime minister narendra modi announced his ""digital india"" initiative, pitched as an ambitious program to modernize this country of more than 1 billion people.since then, the government abruptly invalidated 86 percent of the cash in circulation, a move toward a ""cashless society"" that led to widespread panic and a currency crisis. it has launched dozens of apps to accompany various government programs - an app to report roadside piles of garbage to authorities, one to keep indians up to date on modi's speeches and even one to find lost children.and undergirding the initiative is aadhaar, an identification program that aims to collect each indian citizen's information, such as fingerprints and retina scans, in a database linked to every part of that person's digital footprint: bank account numbers, cellphone details, income tax filings, voter ids, ostensibly allowing the government to curb identity fraud and welfare corruption.but since it began, the program has become increasingly troublesome, presenting privacy issues and preventing thousands of people from receiving basic entitlements, such as food rations, pensions and fuel subsidies.for 10-year-old nadini singh, a clerical error on her id card meant she could not return to school. she and her father, netrapal, whose name is misspelled on her card, traveled an hour to a delhi office of the unique identification authority, which oversees aadhaar, to correct the mistake this month, waiting for hours alongside a dozen other schoolchildren whose cards - made when they were toddlers - had similar errors.""if i don't get aadhaar, i won't go to school,"" said nadini, perched on a metal chair outside the government office, half asleep in the afternoon heat. ""and if i don't go to school, i can't become a doctor.""the program had also caused problems for others in line. kela devi, who works at a government-run child-care center, had not received her salary for eight months because of authentication problems with her card. avdesh yadav, 34, couldn't access his bank account because his fingerprints didn't work in the bank's machine. madanlal nanda, 74, broke into tears when he explained that he had not received his pension for two months because his fingerprints, worn with age, wouldn't register in the machines. the programme has faced privacy issues, preventing thousands of people from receiving basic entitlementsnadini's father had been trying to fix the error on his daughter's card since january. with the school registration deadline only two days away, officials at the regional office rolled down the shutters, closing for the day. the singhs would have to wait another day.india's supreme court is hearing cases challenging the biometric program. some petitioners argue aadhaar impinges on basic constitutional rights. others say it has led to needy people being excluded from welfare programs. one case suggests it could have resounding implications for people of lower castes who could face discrimination if biometrics are matched with surnames and addresses - often indicators of caste.modi's office and the unique identification authority did not respond to requests for comment. but the government said in a supreme court hearing this week that aadhaar is secure and that no one should be denied entitlements because of the biometric identification program.aadhaar was launched in 2009 by former prime minister manmohan singh's government. it was touted as india's answer to the bureaucratic conundrum of managing the country's welfare allowances. modi, who raised serious concerns about the program during his election campaign, has embraced and extended it since taking office in 2014.his government argues that aadhaar is no longer just about clamping down on welfare corruption; instead, it is the government's answer to reducing corruption and finding solutions for tricky business problems.in january, the government made aadhaar mandatory to receive various benefits, including food rations - effectively pressuring millions of indians to sign up for the program. state governments introduced machines at ration shops to identify people by their fingerprints, retinas or cellphone numbers, replacing the old handwritten ledgers.googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display(""adslotnativevideo""); });but using the machines can be difficult in india, where connectivity problems are rampant and digital literacy is limited. ""every day, i have to turn two or three people away at least,"" said one ration shop owner. ""the elderly find it the most difficult.""privacy experts and activists, including edward snowden, the former u.s. national security agency contractor and whistleblower, fear the information could be used to snoop on citizens or misused by private companies that have access to it. security experts say the details could be easily leaked or hacked.""this is an incredible tool for surveillance,"" said reetika khera, an economist and social scientist at the indian institute of technology delhi. ""there is little benefit, and it is devastating for the welfare system.""reports in the local news media have pointed out various flaws in the way data is compiled. government websites inadvertently displayed millions of people's personal details. former village-level aadhaar operators were suspected of accessing the database illegally and offering hoards of data to buyers, as reported this year in the tribune, an indian english-language newspaper. parents are sometimes asked to use their fingerprints in place of their children's, creating authentication problems later. in some cases, mistakes by aadhaar operators have led to dogs, trees and chairs reportedly being issued aadhaar cards.and activists say the core problem of welfare corruption remains.anjali bhardwaj, of the right to food campaign, cited multiple cases of people being denied rations on the pretext of authentication failures - while government records showed that the rations had been taken, pointing to ration theft by shop owners.but the program has also won international plaudits. a report by the bill and melinda gates foundation praised aadhaar, saying it ""makes it simpler and more secure for poor people to do business with banks."" a world bank report from 2016 said the program potentially saved india $11 billion every year: former chief economist paul romer said aadhaar was the most sophisticated system of its kind and should be adopted in other countries.in delhi, after the government office closed for the day, nadini and her father made their way home empty-handed. they'll be back.""we've been here for the past two days,"" netrapal said.
