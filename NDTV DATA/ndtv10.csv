2012-03-22,"coal report not final, leak causes us anguish: cag writes to prime minister","new delhi: the government has been accused of a massive coal scam by the opposition - both houses of parliament were adjourned this morning. the latest crisis for the government is based on a draft report on coal mining by the government's auditor, the comptroller and auditor general (cag). the leaked draft finds fault with the allocation of 155 coalfields to about 100 private and some public sector units or state-run firms between 2004 and 2009 instead of auctioning them off to the highest bidder. the losses, according to the draft report, add upto rs 10.7 lakh crore. the auditor does not make accusations of corruption, but says the government had extended ""undue benefits"" to the companies, and that in the absence of an auction, the sale of the coalfields was ""subjective"" and allowed ""windfall gains."" (excerpts from coal scam report by govt auditor (cag)the prime minister oversaw the coal ministry for some of the period in question in the draft report. the government says it has so far not received a copy of the report. the prime minister's office says that it got a letter from the comptroller and auditor general of india this afternoon. the letter allegedly states that ""in the extant case the details being brought out were observations which are under discussion at a very preliminary stage and do not even constitute our pre-final draft and hence are exceedingly misleading...pursuant to clarification provided by the ministry in exit conferences held on 9.02.2012 and 9.03.2012, we have changed our thinking .... in fact it is not even our case that the unintended benefit to the allottee is an equivalent loss to the exchequer. the leak of the initial draft causes great embarrassment as the audit report is still under preparation."" (prime minister's office on cag report on coal mining)the emphasis by the cag on an auction echoes the supreme court's recent order which said the government must use an auction to distribute all natural resources. that order came as the supreme court cancelled 122 telecom licenses that were sold, not through a bidding process, but to companies that were allegedly favoured in a distorted first-come-first-served process. in its draft report, the auditor says that the coal offered to firms was severely under-valued by the government and an auction of the coal-blocks would have helped ensure that the benefit of the low costs of coal production is passed on to the public.india is the world's third-largest coal producer in the world after china and the united states. state-run power company ntpc told reuters it had made no windfall profits from the allocations and that the lower costs meant cheaper electricity for consumers.coal minister sriprakash jaiswal said that the government used advertisements in newspaper ads to invite offers for the coal fields in question. he also said that all state governments were consulted before the allocations were completed, and that bjp or left led governments in states like west bengal and rajasthan had expressed reservations about an auction. ""the coal blocks are allocated through a screening committee which is chaired by coal secretary,"" he said. before that, he explained, ""we gave advertisements for allocation of coal blocks and invited applications...after the applications were received by us (coal ministry), the state governments were consulted and thereafter the coal blocks were allocated.""googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display(""adslotnativevideo""); });the indian subsidiary of arcelormittal and steel makers tata and jindal steel and power, are among the companies named in the report. jindal's controlling shareholder, naveen jindal, who is also a member of parliament, defended the policy of direct allocations, saying it had allowed private companies to jump-start production at mines left idle by state-run coal india limited, the world's single largest producerthe upa has spent the last year trying unsuccessfully to beat its image as a government operating in a continuum of corruption and crisis, unable to implement reform or introduce transparency.

is it true that you have been given undue favours during the period? i have also seen it in the newspapers. i have not read the report. so i must tell you from what i have read in the newspapers, i can only tell you ntpc's version. we have been given coal blocks to actually augment our coal requirements for power generation. because coal india was unable to meet the requirements of ntpc . when we are given a coal block, we are in a regulated system of central electricity regulatory commosion (cerc) where all our input costs are through the regulator and that is then a pass through into the tariff. so there is no way that ntpc can hedge the price and sell it somewhere else. so there are no windfall profits as far as ntpc is concerned. on the contrary, it may help the consumer or the customer of the electricity to get a little cheaper electricity. can you specify as to how many coal blocks were allocated to you during 2004-2009. have you started mining from these blocks? if yes, can you specify as to what is the production from these mines ? no, we were allocated 5 mines out of that if you know 3 had been withdrawn. recently, they have been reinstated in principle. the final letter is coming out of two mines. work has started on one of them. but now we are only removing the burden. coal production will start sometime in the next year . the 2nd block we have is more or less selected. the mdo and the mdo appointment will take place in a month or two. have you been at any point of time been contacted by cag in this regard? also, will you be taking up this issue with cag ? no, unless we get the report officially, we cannot take it up with the cag. but we have not been consulted on this by the cag and that’s all i can say as of now. we are also hearing it from the newspapers and the tv channels. are you in favour of auctioning of natural resources like coal blocks? no auctioning is always to be done against a benchmark . indian coal is of such poor quality, with almost 50 per cent ash. i do not think it can be benchmarked against international coal. secondly, coal is our only energy resource, which we have in the country. we cannot price it at international level. none of the regions like middleeast and america who have their own resources. they don't price it at the level for internal consumption. so coal will have to remain at a forward pricing. cost of production of coal should be at the right price for the power sector. that is why i have been saying that we need a coal regulator to keep an account of the actual expenditure. this is happening in mining and should be passed on into the cost of power. will you return the coal blocks if the government asks you to do so? will you participate in the bidding process if the centre decides to go for rebidding for the blocks allotted from 2004-2009? i think both are hypothetical at the moment. the centre, i don't think will ask us to return the coal blocks because we are after all generating energy and we have certain targets in consultation with the government for capacity expansion. it does not make sense to expand capacity if the fuel is not available. coming to the 2nd point again, it’s hypothetical. is there a option whether we will participate ? it is very difficult now. what i have said earlier was that i am looking at the right price. if there is a right price, i can also participate in the auction. what is the problem? there is no issue in that. what is the kind of capacity addition plans that you have for fy13 and capex for the same? see for the fy 13, our capital expenditure is around rs 20,900 crore. the capacity addition will be 2,500 mega watts. with regard to the recent boiler order, can you specify as to how many boiler orders were won by bgr? also who were the other winners and how much did each company win ? i think we had 2 categories. one is of 660 of boilers and one was the 800 of boilers and in the 660 boilers, bgr did not win any. in the 800 boilers category, i think bgr has won 5 units. if i remember correctly, i think that is the right number. you were looking for acquisitions in indonesia, mozambique & australia for your coal linkages. have you finalised any of these ? also with new laws in indonesia & australia, are you now looking at alternate options?googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display(""adslotnativevideo""); }); let me tell you that we were looking at many things, let me also tell you with new laws and change of goal post by indonesia and another countries, the coal from there has become frightfully expensive for the power sector and any addition of this goal increases the cost of energy. today with the state electricity boards’ financial health not being very good, they are unable to buy this power. so first of all whatever i had planned earlier as the amount of imported coal that i will use has substantially reduced. my boilers can use up to 30 percent of imported coal along with domestic coal but due to cost compulsions, we are keeping it at 10 percent, we are importing 10 percent of imported coal now. but it makes sense to acquire mines or start your own mining abroad provided the coal from there is available straightaway. number one and number two is the price of coal is substantially lower than what rate we are importing today, after all one must understand that we are not a mining company, we are a power generator. we need coal immediately now and we need it at the right price. if all these are ok then we are looking at it. we are still open. there are proposals, all the time in our system if the price is right, location is right and coal is of the right quality, we will just go ahead. finally, sir….what are your views on the budget…what are some of the positives and may be some negatives for you from the budget ? if you want to take the negative first, we are a little skeptic on what is going to happen on increase in service tax and excise duty. but there are many positives if you look at it closely. the extension on 80 ia ie one of them, then the withholding tax reduction in the ecb is second of them. then there is i think on the import of power equipments, duty has been exempted. we can import coal equipments, we are getting into coal mines. so that helps us in trying to import equipments for coal mining. then there has been reduction in the imported coal. so probably that might make imported coal slightly cheaper marginally, we are looking at it. these are some of the issues which we are looking very positively on the power sector side and i must tell you that my team is looking at it very closely as to how does this actually transforms into our business.",0.09481858054226472,"coal mines scam : ntpc denies windfall gains , calls regulator","new delhi : highlightsamid uproar allocation 155 coal acreages 2004 2009 100 companies , ndtv talks chairman managing director ntpc , arup roy choudhury scam future plans power producer.window._pricee = window._pricee &#124; &#124; [ ] ; _pricee.push( { container : ' _pcwgtmid ' } ) ; reports coal mines allocation scam hit upa government. amid uproar allocation 155 coal acreages 2004 2009 100 companies , ndtv talks chairman managing director ntpc arup roy choudhury , scam future plans power producer. say news reports comptroller auditor general ' ( cag ) report coal blocks ?

2012-03-27,final audit report on coal similar to 'leaked' draft: sources,"mumbai: highlightsdinesh thakkar, chairman and managing director at angel broking says that more than liquidity, inflation is matter of concern for the markets.window._pricee = window._pricee || []; _pricee.push({container : '_pcwgtmid'});a report critical of the government's handling of a coal fields sale will not change substantially from a leaked draft that talked of $211 billion in lost revenues, sources said, after the government tried to downplay the findings. last week, the comptroller and auditor general (cag) called parts of the draft ""exceedingly misleading"" and the prime minister's office scrambled to quell the row, which sparked uproar in parliament and stoked fears another major corruption scandal was about to break. but two senior sources at the auditor's office who spoke to reuters now say the final report will be close in essence to the leaked copy. ""normally our reports are not works of imagination. there is an elaborate system of verifying facts,"" a senior official at the cag, who asked not to be named, told reuters. ""our reports are always based on facts and the process of verifying them is long and intense,"" he added. another source at the auditor's office echoed his comments, but said the final report may speak in terms of windfall gains to companies rather than lost revenues. a newspaper published the draft on thursday, saying coalfields handed out to private and state companies for small fees should have been auctioned for billions of dollars. the report caused a brief adjournment of parliament and sent markets down on fears this could turn into the latest corruption scandal to hit prime minister manmohan singh government in his second term, derailing economic reforms at a time of slowing growth. singh has lurched from crisis to crisis since massive graft in the sale of telecoms spectrum surfaced two years ago, culminating in the quashing of licenses and the jailing of executives and a minister. the telecoms sale may have cost the government up to $36 billion. india's reputation for graft stretches from construction to defense contracts. the telecoms contract cancellations and jailing of company executives have made investors jittery. on monday, the head of the army said he had personally been offered a $2.8 million bribe to approve the purchase of 600 faulty vehicles. in another headache for the prime minister, the draft report suggests singh suggested auctioning the fields, but later his office backtracked, partly because of pressure from state governments. his office also said mining laws needed to be changed before auctions could be held. the report does not allege corruption as the motive for the sales.

""if the allegations against him are proved wrong, we will be happy,"" he said.in response, the prime minister's office released this evening a detailed explanation on how coal fields were allocated from 2006-2009, when the pm had direct charge of the coal ministry. (read full statement)team anna, the aides closest to gandhian activist anna hazare, say that the prime minister appears to have over-ruled advice to auction coal fields; as a result, private companies paid far less than they should have, and the government lost 1.8 lakh crores, according to some estimates. the issue has been studied by the government's auditor and its draft report was leaked in march, after which comptroller and auditor general (cag) vinod rai said the leaked portions were misleading. speaking to ndtv, union coal minister sriprakash jaiswal said that there was no question of a probe into the allegations of team anna against the pm. ""the nation benefitted with these coal block allocations. there is no question of an investigation,"" mr jaiswal said.a note from the prime minister's office states that ""the allocation of coal blocks was never looked upon as a potential source for generating revenue for the central government. the government was committed to developing infrastructure and industry.""the pmo's note says that the proposal to auction coal fields was mooted in 2005. over the next three years, different stake-holders including the state governments of chhattisgarh, west bengal and rajasthan and the ministry of power were consulted. they were allegedly worried that switching to a bidding process or auction would increase the cost of coal and affect development and industry. while they were being persuaded, the allocation of coal fields could not be suspended - investment was needed in the coal sector to ensure an adequate supply for a surging economy and to prevent higher imports. the prime minister's office stresses that the process of allocation was handled by a screening committee; ads were placed by the government to invite the maximum bids and to present equal opportunities to all interested players. in 2008, parliament was presented with amended guidelines that focused on auctioning coal fields to the highest bidder.googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display(""adslotnativevideo""); });the bjp has also called for an independent investigation into what's referred to as coal-gate, though it has earlier this week said that it does not support the language used by the activists against the pm. the party's rajiv pratap rudy described dr manmohan singh as ""an honest pm, who heads a dishonest government."" mr rudy added, ""his ministers go to jail...he becomes a suspect, because of situations.""

2012-05-30,coal ministry clarification mentioned in prime minister's reply,"new delhi: after the prime minister promised to resign if ""even an iota of truth"" was found in the charges of corruption levelled against him by team anna, the activists have urged him once again to commission an independent investigation to determine whether allegations of a huge coal scam are correct. in response, the prime minister's office released this evening a detailed explanation on how coal fields were allocated from 2006-2009, when the prime minister had direct charge of the coal ministry.here is the full text of the clarification:a clarification regarding allotment of coal blocks during the period of 2004-2009doubts have been raised in certain quarters regarding allocation of coal blocks to private companies for captive use during the period 2004-2009. as per media reports letters have also been written purportedly to the government raising similar issues. clarifications in regard to these issues had already been placed on the website of the ministry of coal on 17th may, 2012. however, certain issues are reiterated and further clarified as below:allocation of coal blocks to private companies for captive use commenced in the year 1993 after the coal mines (nationalisation) act, 1973 was amended. this was done with the objective of attracting private investments in specified end uses. initially there was not much demand for such allocation and the applicants themselves used to identify the coal blocks and seek allocation. as the economy grew in size, the demand for coal also grew, particularly due to expansion in the energy sector. it was felt that coal india ltd. alone would not be able to meet the growing demand and, therefore, the option of giving a bigger role to the private sector was explored. it is in this background that we should appreciate the reasons for allocation of coal blocks to private parties for captive use during this period. 2. while allocation of coal blocks began in 1993, it was only in 2004 that for the first time, the idea of making allocations through competitive bidding was mooted and in 2005 the government initiated a proposal to amend the coal mines (nationalization) act. the delay of three years between initiating the process of legislative changes and introducing the amendment bill in the parliament was mainly due to time taken in consensus building among divergent views of the various stakeholders. state governments such as chhattisgarh, west bengal and rajasthan were opposed to the amendment as they felt that it would increase the cost of coal, adversely impact value addition and development of industries in their areas and would dilute their prerogative in selection of an allocatee. ministry of power, too, felt that auctioning of coal may lead to enhanced cost of coal. legal issues of whether amendment was required in the coal mines (nationalization) act or mines & minerals (development & regulation) act (mmdr act) were to be carefully examined. it was only through multilayered consultations and discussions that these issues were finally resolved and the amendment bill could be introduced in the rajya sahba in 2008. the central government was always keen to quickly push through the changes. however, it could not have moved ahead without duly considering the concerns of various stakeholders. 3. in the meanwhile, keeping in view the increase in applicants for coal blocks, the government evolved a consolidated set of guidelines to ensure consistency in allocation. in september 2005 the system was further improved bringing in greater transparency. in the improved system applications were invited through open advertisements against an identified list of coal blocks. googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display(""adslotnativevideo""); });4. even as the process of switching over from screening committee procedure to competitive bidding was initiated, it was felt that the required legislative changes would be time consuming. on the other hand, imperatives of economic growth required massive capacity addition and this issue was deliberated at length in the meetings of the energy coordination committee that had recommended allocation of coal blocks to prospective power producers. it would not have been prudent to disrupt the momentum of accelerated investments in coal sector, especially as it was felt that it would take time in bringing about the required legislative and the consequent procedural changes. if the coal blocks were not made available between 2005 and 2010, it would have resulted in higher imports causing outflow of foreign exchange and would have had deleterious effect on large investments in crucial sectors like power and steel. these were the main reasons for continuation of allocation of the captive coal blocks. moreover, it may also be noted that no coal block was offered for allocation after introduction of the amendment bill in the parliament. whatever allocations have been made after 2008, are as a result of culmination of the process initiated before the introduction of the bill. 5. it may be stated that the allocation of coal blocks was never looked upon as a potential source for generating revenue for the central government. the intent of the government was to induce rapid development of infrastructure which was so very essential to keep the economy on a high growth trajectory. hence the question of maximizing revenue does not arise at all. the idea of introduction of bidding cropped up only in the wake of increasing demand for captive coal blocks and the consequent necessity of putting in place a process which is demonstrably more transparent. 6. the intent of the government was to involve the private sector to invest in identified infrastructure sectors in the interest of the country and its economy and, to this end; this developmental process was resorted to. the allocation of coal blocks to private sector companies is only for captive use and not for sale or commercial use of coal. since the blocks are allocated to private companies only for captive purposes for the specified end-use the question of linking the blocks to the market price/cil price of coal does not arise at all. 7. it may be pointed out that the coal blocks for captive end use were allotted on the basis of recommendations of a screening committee which followed a fair and transparent procedure giving equal opportunity to all applicants. the screening committee was a broad based body with representation from state governments at the level of the chief secretaries, concerned ministries of the central government and the coal companies. the procedure adopted for allocation involved wide consultations with all stakeholders. the parameters and the guidelines for allocation were duly notified and followed by the committee while evaluating the applications. comprehensive details about the applicant/the group, performance of the group, financial strength, readiness of the end-use plant, etc. were placed before the committee enabling it to assess the comparative merits of the applicants and make fair and just recommendations. details of each application were shared with the concerned state government and the line ministry. the applicant was also provided an opportunity to present his case before the screening committee. the screening committee assessed the applications having regard to the matters such as techno-economic feasibility of the end use project, status of preparedness to set up the end use project, past track record in execution of projects, financial and technical capabilities of the applicant companies, recommendations of the state governments and the administrative ministry concerned. the process of allocation of blocks was equitable, fair and just which is borne out of the fact that there has never been any serious allegation against the working of the screening committee. the move to introduce competitive bidding is to make the selection process demonstrably more transparent.",0.10205350543765183,coal ministry clarification mentioned prime minister ' reply,"new delhi : prime minister promised resign "" even iota truth "" found charges corruption levelled team anna , activists urged commission independent investigation determine whether allegations huge coal scam correct. response , prime minister ' office released evening detailed explanation coal fields allocated 2006-2009 , prime minister direct charge coal ministry.here full text clarification : clarification regarding allotment coal blocks period 2004-2009doubts raised certain quarters regarding allocation coal blocks private companies captive use period 2004-2009. per media reports letters also written purportedly government raising similar issues. clarifications regard issues already placed website ministry coal 17th may , 2012. however , certain issues reiterated clarified : allocation coal blocks private companies captive use commenced year 1993 coal mines ( nationalisation ) act , 1973 amended. done objective attracting private investments specified end uses. initially much demand allocation applicants used identify coal blocks seek allocation. economy grew size , demand coal also grew , particularly due expansion energy sector. felt coal india ltd. alone would able meet growing demand , therefore , option giving bigger role private sector explored. background appreciate reasons allocation coal blocks private parties captive use period. 2. allocation coal blocks began 1993 , 2004 first time , idea making allocations competitive bidding mooted 2005 government initiated proposal amend coal mines ( nationalization ) act. delay three years initiating process legislative changes introducing amendment bill parliament mainly due time taken consensus building among divergent views various stakeholders. state governments chhattisgarh , west bengal rajasthan opposed amendment felt would increase cost coal , adversely impact value addition development industries areas would dilute prerogative selection allocatee. ministry power , , felt auctioning coal may lead enhanced cost coal. legal issues whether amendment required coal mines ( nationalization ) act mines &amp;

2012-08-27,prime minister's statement in parliament on cag report on coal block allocations: full text,"new delhi: the prime minister was not allowed to speak in both houses of the parliament to clarify his and the government's stand on the auditor's report on the coal block allocations. the bjp shouted loudly, demanding his resignation, extending the strategy that it adopted all of last week to paralyze parliament.dr manmohan singh then stepped out and spoke to tv cameras saying he appeals to the opposition to return to the house, debate all the issues and let the country judge where the truth lies. below is his full statement.prime minister's statement in parliament on the performance audit report on allocation of coal blocks and augmentation of coal production 1. i seek the indulgence of the house to make a statement on issues regarding coal block allocations which have been the subject of much discussion in the press and on which several hon'ble members have also expressed concern.2. the issues arise from a report of the comptroller and auditor general which has been tabled in parliament and remitted to the public accounts committee. cag reports are normally discussed in detail in the public accounts committee, when the ministry concerned responds to the issues raised. the pac then submits its report to the speaker and that report is then discussed in parliament. 3. i seek your indulgence to depart from this established procedure because of the nature of the allegations that are being made and because i was holding the charge of coal minister for a part of the time covered by the report. i want to assure hon'ble members that as the minister in charge, i take full responsibility for the decisions of the ministry. i wish to say that any allegations of impropriety are without basis and unsupported by the facts. 4. allocation of coal blocks to private companies for captive use commenced in 1993, after the coal mines (nationalisation) act, 1973 was amended. this was done with the objective of attracting private investments in specified end uses. as the economy grew in size, the demand for coal also grew and it became evident that coal india ltd. alone would not be able to meet the growing demand. 5. since 1993, allocation of captive coal blocks was being done on the basis of recommendations made by an inter-ministerial screening committee which also had representatives of state governments. taking into account the increasing number of applicants for coal block allocation, the government, in 2003, evolved a consolidated set of guidelines to ensure transparency and consistency in allocation. 6. in the wake of rapidly growing demand for coal and captive coal blocks, it was the upa i government which, for the first time, conceived the idea of making allocations through the competitive bidding route in june 2004.7. the cag report is critical of the allocations mainly on three counts. firstly, it states that the screening committee did not follow a transparent and objective method while making recommendations for allocation of coal blocks. 8. secondly, it observes that competitive bidding could have been introduced in 2006 by amending the administrative instructions in vogue instead of going through a prolonged legal examination of the issue which delayed the decision making process. 9. finally, the report mentions that the delay in introduction of competitive bidding rendered the existing process beneficial to a large number of private companies. according to the assumptions and computations made by the cag, there is a financial gain of about rs. 1.86 lakh crore to private parties.10. the observations of the cag are clearly disputable. 11. the policy of allocation of coal blocks to private parties, which the cag has criticised, was not a new policy introduced by the upa. the policy has existed since 1993 and previous governments also allocated coal blocks in precisely the manner that the cag has now criticised. 12. the upa made improvements in the procedure in 2005 by inviting applications through open advertisements after providing details of the coal blocks on offer along with the guidelines and the conditions of allotment. these applications were examined and evaluated by a broad based steering committee with representatives from state governments, related ministries of the central government and the coal companies. the applications were assessed on parameters such as the techno economic feasibility of the end use project, status of preparedness to set up the end use project, past track record in execution of projects, financial and technical capabilities of the applicant companies, recommendations of the state governments and the administrative ministry concerned.13. any administrative allocation procedure involves some judgment and in this case the judgment was that of the many participants in the screening committee acting collectively. there were then no allegations of impropriety in the functioning of the committee.14. the cag says that competitive bidding could have been introduced in 2006 by amending the existing administrative instructions. this premise of the cag is flawed. 15. the observation of the cag that the process of competitive bidding could have been introduced by amending the administrative instructions is based on the opinion expressed by the department of legal affairs in july and august 2006. however, the cag's observation is based on a selective reading of the opinions given by the department of legal affairs. 16. initially, the government had initiated a proposal to introduce competitive bidding by formulating appropriate rules. this matter was referred to the department of legal affairs, which initially opined that amendment to the coal mines (nationalisation) act would be necessary for this purpose. 17. a meeting was convened in the pmo on 25 july 2005 which was attended by representatives of coal and lignite bearing states. in the meeting the representatives of state governments were opposed to the proposed switch over to competitive bidding. it was further noted that the legislative changes that would be required for the proposed change would require considerable time and the process of allocation of coal blocks for captive mining could not be kept in abeyance for so long given the pressing demand for coal. therefore, it was decided in this meeting to continue with the allocation of coal blocks through the extant screening committee procedure till the new competitive bidding procedure became operational. this was a collective decision of the centre and the state governments concerned.googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display(""adslotnativevideo""); });18. it was only in august 2006 that the department of legal affairs opined that competitive bidding could be introduced through administrative instructions. however, the same department also opined that legislative amendments would be required for placing the proposed process on a sound legal footing. in a meeting held in september, 2006, secretary, department of legal affairs categorically opined that having regard to the nature and scope of the relevant legislation, it would be most appropriate to achieve the objective through amendment to the mines & minerals (development & regulation) act. 19. in any case, in a democracy, it is difficult to accept the notion that a decision of the government to seek legislative amendment to implement a change in policy should come for adverse audit scrutiny. the issue was contentious and the proposed change to competitive bidding required consensus building among various stakeholders with divergent views, which is inherent in the legislative process. 20. as stated above, major coal and lignite bearing states like west bengal, chhattisgarh, jharkhand, orissa and rajasthan that were ruled by opposition parties, were strongly opposed to a switch over to the process of competitive bidding as they felt that it would increase the cost of coal, adversely impact value addition and development of industries in their areas and would dilute their prerogative in the selection of lessees. 21. the then chief minister of rajasthan smt. vasundhara raje wrote to me in april 2005 opposing competitive bidding saying that it was against the spirit of the sarkaria commission recommendations. dr. raman singh, chief minister of chhattisgarh wrote to me in june 2005 seeking continuation of the extant policy and requesting that any changes in coal policy be made after arriving at a consensus between the central government and the states. the state governments of west bengal and orissa also wrote formally opposing a change to the system of competitive bidding. 22. ministry of power, too, felt that auctioning of coal could lead to enhanced cost of producing energy. 23. it is pertinent to mention that the coal mines nationalisation (amendment) bill, 2000 to facilitate commercial mining by private companies was pending in the parliament for a long time owing to stiff opposition from the stakeholders. 24. despite the elaborate consultative process undertaken prior to introducing the amendment bill in parliament, the standing committee advised the ministry of coal to carry out another round of discussions with the states. this further demonstrates that the decision to seek broader consultation and consensus through a parliamentary process was the right one. 25. the cag report has criticised the government for not implementing this decision speedily enough. in retrospect, i would readily agree that in a world where things can be done by fiat, we could have done it faster. but, given the complexities of the process of consensus building in our parliamentary system, this is easier said than done. 26. let me humbly submit that, even if we accept cag's contention that benefits accrued to private companies, their computations can be questioned on a number of technical points. the cag has computed financial gains to private parties as being the difference between the average sale price and the production cost of cil of the estimated extractable reserves of the allocated coal blocks. firstly, computation of extractable reserves based on averages would not be correct. secondly, the cost of production of coal varies significantly from mine to mine even for cil due to varying geo-mining conditions, method of extraction, surface features, number of settlements, availability of infrastructure etc. thirdly, cil has been generally mining coal in areas with better infrastructure and more favourable mining conditions, whereas the coal blocks offered for captive mining are generally located in areas with more difficult geological conditions. fourthly, a part of the gains would in any case get appropriated by the government through taxation and under the mmdr bill, presently being considered by the parliament, 26% of the profits earned on coal mining operations would have to be made available for local area development. therefore, aggregating the purported financial gains to private parties merely on the basis of the average production costs and sale price of cil could be highly misleading. moreover, as the coal blocks were allocated to private companies only for captive purposes for specified end-uses, it would not be appropriate to link the allocated blocks to the price of coal set by cil.27. there are other important technical issues which will be gone into thoroughly in the ministry of coal's detailed response to the pac and i do not propose to focus on them.28. it is true that the private parties that were allocated captive coal blocks could not achieve their production targets. this could be partly due to cumbersome processes involved in getting statutory clearances, an issue we are addressing separately. we have initiated action to cancel the allocations of allottees who did not take adequate follow-up action to commence production. moreover, cbi is separately investigating the allegations of malpractices, on the basis of which due action will be taken against wrongdoers, if any. hon'ble members, 29. from 1993 onwards, successive governments continued with the policy of allocation of coal blocks for captive use and did not treat such allocations as a revenue generating activity. let me reiterate that the idea of introducing auction was conceived for the first time by the upa government in the wake of increasing demand for captive blocks. action was initiated to examine the idea in all its dimensions and the process culminated in parliament approving the necessary legislative amendments in 2010. the law making process inevitably took time on account of several factors that i have outlined. 30. while the process of making legislative changes was in progress, the only alternative before the government was to continue with the current system of allocations through the screening committee mechanism till the new system of auction based competitive bidding could be put in place. stopping the process of allocation would only have delayed the much needed expansion in the supply of coal. although the coal produced thus far from the blocks allocated to the private sector is below the target, it is reasonable to expect that as clearances are speeded up, production will come into effect in the course of the twelfth plan. postponing the allocation of coal blocks until the new system was in place would have meant lower energy production, lower gdp growth and also lower revenues. it is unfortunate that the cag has not taken these aspects into account. 31. let me state emphatically that it has always been the intention of government to augment production of coal by making available coal blocks for captive mining through transparent processes and guidelines which fully took into account the legitimate concerns of all stakeholders, including the state governments. the implicit suggestion of the cag that the government should have circumvented the legislative process through administrative instructions, over the registered objections of several state governments including those ruled by opposition parties, if implemented would have been undemocratic and contrary to the spirit of the functioning of our federal polity. the facts speak for themselves and show that the cag's findings are flawed on multiple counts. 32. this, in short, is the background, the factual position and the rationale of government's actions. now that the report of the cag is before the house, appropriate action on the recommendations and observations contained in the report will follow through the established parliamentary procedures.",0.08653789248725957,prime minister ' statement parliament cag report coal block allocations : full text,"new delhi : prime minister allowed speak houses parliament clarify government '

2012-09-04,"coal scandal: raids, firs and growing controversy around a congress mp","congress mp vijay dardanew delhi: the cbi has filed first information reports or firs against five private firms who were allocated coal blocks in jharkhand and chhattisgarh. two firms whose offices were raided are linked to congress mp vijay darda, which makes it harder for his party to refute charges of a coal policy riddled with crony capitalism. sources say mr dardam who has been named in the fir, will be questioned soon. the fir refers to charges of cheating and conspiracy against jld yavatmal, jas infrastructure, amr iron and steel, vinni iron and steel and navbharat power. the cbi is investigating whether companies misreported their financial or technical qualifications to be granted valuable coal fields in possible collusion with government officials.mr darda is associated with two of these companies which he set up with influential businessman manoj jayaswal - jas infrastructure where he has a 7% stake along with his son, and jld yavatmal, a company named after his father. mr darda says that in 2009, he ended his association with this firm because it dropped its plans to set up a power plant in yavatmal, the district that he belongs to. he has denied that he used his position as an mp to help companies that he was associated with land coal fields. but the raids today suggest that the cbi believes these firms were ineligible for coal permits.last night, mr darda told ndtv, ""i was not in the driver's seat...my son was leading the show."" he added, ""where is the nexus? everyone has the right to do business. my conscience is absolutely clear. i am very happy,"" he said.the cbi's raids are intended at uncovering irregularities in the allocation process. sources say it's unlikely that mr jayaswal's different companies were collectively given 20 coal blocks without the influence of his high-level connections. mr jayaswal's political clout is on display in photographs from his daughter's wedding which he celebrated in delhi and mumbai in 2009. seen with the entrepreneur are current coal minister sriprakash jaiswal, delhi chief minister sheila dikshit, as well as senior bjp leaders like lk advani and nitin gadkari, who is from nagpur, like mr jayaswal.googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display(""adslotnativevideo""); });the congress has already been heavily embarrassed by the revelation that union minister subodh kant sahai in 2008 wrote to the prime minister's office, lobbying for coal blocks for a company that has his brother as a director.another company raided today - vinni iron and steel - is being investigated for links to former jharkhand chief minister madhu koda, who spent two years in prison on money-laundering charges. vaibhav tulsyan, who once owned the firm and was raided today, claimed he had sold the company to a close aide of mr koda before the coal blocks were allocated. ""because of a naxal problem, we were not able to run the company, so when vijay joshi, who was a close aide of former chief minister madhu koda, approached us with a good offer, we sold the company to him,"" he said to the press trust of india. the cbi's inquiry is rooted in a complaint filed by bjp leader prakash javadekar four months ago with the government's anti-graft department or central vigilance commission (cvc). then, last month, the government auditor or cag said that 142 coal fields allocated between 2004 and 2009 had allowed private firms to get windfall benefits of upto 1.86 lakh crores because the coal mines were sold at highly undervalued rates, instead of being auctioned. that has led to a huge political crisis with the opposition bjp demanding the resignation of prime minister manmohan singh and disrupting parliament every day of this session, ensuring that virtually no business has been transacted. uproar over the issue forced adjournments in both houses of parliament today as well.the cbi's raids are unlikely to make any headway into breaking the parliament deadlock, since the bjp is adamant on the cancellation of allocation of all 142 coal blocks mentioned in the auditor's report, which the government has declined. finance minister p chidambaram said yesterday, ""the demand for cancellation of all 142 coal blocks allocated after 2004 is not founded on sound logic...it (cancellation) cannot be done through diktat or arbitrary orders. there is a procedure for it and that procedure is underway."" at the same time, a government review committee has shortlisted 58 companies whose coal licences are likely to be revoked for underperformance. the firms have been asked to explain their defence starting friday. by september 15, the government will share if their permits will be cancelled. wary of this being seen as an admission of its faulty coal policy, the government has said that these licences have been under review since april, months before the auditor or cag presented its politically incendiary report.

however, only the mining plan was submitted. the ravanwara north coal block was allotted to sks ispat and power limited in 2007. tourism minister subodh kant sahai's brother sudhir kant sahai, has in the past, held the position of ""honorary director"" in sks ispat.the new patrapara coal block was allotted to bhushan steel in 2006. the block has an extractable reserve of 316.09 million tonnes. it was meant to be used for making sponge iron, which finds application in steel manufacturing. the block is also mentioned in the comptroller and auditor general's (cag) report which had estimated that the company got undue benefit to the tune of rs 9,338 crore.the group has also recommended the deduction of bank guarantee in the cases of nerad malegaon block allotted to m/s gupta metaliks and power limited and gupta coalfields limited, lohari block allotted to usha martin limited, radhikapur east coal block allotted to m/s tata sponge iron limited and others, and bijahan coal block allotted to bhushan limited. the inter-ministerial group has so far scrutinised the replies by 18 coal block allottees, including four today, in its three meeting in the last four days. it would meet again on monday.the group is scrutinising 29 blocks awarded to private firms out of the total 58 which were given show-cause notices for delays in developing mines.googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display(""adslotnativevideo"");

2012-09-16,foreign media on coal scam and crony capitalism," his business rivals never fully understood how manoj jayaswal got so rich so fast, except that he often seemed joined at the hip with powerful politicians. he hosted them at lavish parties, entertained them at his daughter's opulent thai wedding and stood among them at india's presidential palace, where a year ago he was praised as a leader in the india growth story. but now mr jayaswal is embroiled in a $34 billion coal mining scandal that has exposed the ugly underside of indian politics and economic life: a brazen style of crony capitalism that has enabled politicians and their friends to reap huge profits by gaining control of vast swaths of the country's natural resources, often for nothing. ""today in india, politicians are so powerful,"" said santosh hegde, a former supreme court justice who recently led a sweeping investigation of a different mining scandal in southern india. ""all together, they are looting the country."" coal-gate, as the scandal is now known here, is centered on the opaque government allotment process that enabled well-connected businessmen and politicians to obtain rights to undeveloped coal fields. investigators are now looking at whether mr jayaswal and vijay darda, a member of parliament, conspired to fraudulently obtain five lucrative coal allocations. naveen jindal, another lawmaker and one of india's richest industrialists, is also reportedly under investigation. even as the scandal has renewed public anger about rising official graft and the state of the economy, coal-gate has provided fresh ammunition for those who say india's politicians have become so venal and feckless that they are no longer able or willing to address the country's entrenched problems. the opposition bharatiya janata party, which was already on the defensive because it had been implicated in mr hegde's investigation, has been so eager to score political points with the latest scandal that it shut down parliament for weeks with floor protests. it refused to allow any debate - even of coal-gate - or any voting unless the prime minister resigned over the scandal. almost an entire session was lost. this sort of political dysfunction is hardly new in india and, in recent years, the economy was booming even as the politicians dithered. but now that the economy is slowing sharply, particularly in the ailing energy sector, analysts say india can no longer afford a government that so flagrantly fails to deliver what it promises. on friday, the government approved long-pending proposals allowing foreign retailers, airlines, broadcasters and other companies to enter the indian market in an effort to shore up the faltering economy. a decade ago, india's leaders announced an idealistic slogan - power for all in 2012 - and pledged to bring electricity to every corner of the country, partly by expanding coal-fired power plants. india still has more than 300 million people living without electricity, and this summer, it suffered the biggest power blackout in history. the scandal in the coal industry, meanwhile, has made it even harder for the country to generate enough electricity to meet its needs. ""not being able to produce enough power has absolutely been the single biggest bottleneck for economic growth,"" said praveen chakravarty, chief executive of mumbai-based anand rathi financial services. unlike other sectors of the economy, natural resources like coal remain tightly controlled by politicians and bureaucrats. a recent study of contributions to india's political parties offered a telling insight into the nexus between politics and money. companies in technology and other service businesses - industries that require few government licenses or permissions - contributed almost nothing. the biggest donors were involved in mining, power and other sectors dependent on the government to obtain rights to natural resources. india is trying to expand cleaner energy sources but still depends on coal for roughly 57 per cent of its electricity. during the 1970s, india nationalized coal and created the state-owned giant, coal india, now the world's largest coal company. india liberalized its once-socialist economy in the early 1990s, and the government privatized a handful of coal fields for ""captive mining"" so that some companies could secure a guaranteed supply of coal, usually for steel or aluminum plants. but by 2004, coal india was not producing coal fast enough to provide power needed to keep up with the country's rapid growth or to achieve the national goal of universal electrification. the newly elected coalition national government, led by the indian national congress party, vowed to open up the power sector, which prompted a rush of applicants for captive coal fields. prime minister manmohan singh, however, did not introduce competitive bidding, leading to a murky allocation process. a government screening committee chose the recipients; several former and current bureaucrats and industry officials say its decisions were highly subjective, often favouring applicants with close ties to state and national political bosses. india's comptroller and auditor general, after examining the committee's minutes and other documents, issued a scathing report last month. one former senior official, surya p sethi, who unsuccessfully lobbied mr singh for a more transparent selection process, said a representative of the global mining giant bhp billiton complained to him that the system was stacked in favour of certain indian businesses. ""they took the recommendations that suited them,"" mr sethi, who now teaches at the national university of singapore, said about the government. ""and they overlooked the recommendations that did not suit them."" investigators now say that some of the favoured applicants, having acquired the coal fields free, quickly sold them for tens of millions of dollars to steel or power companies. others simply kept them as an asset and have not yet developed them, even as the country faces blackouts and coal shortages. ""politicians realized that this kind of coal was black gold,"" said eas sarma, a former power secretary. on thursday, in an effort to regain some of its lost credibility, a government panel reviewing coal concessions announced that it was reclaiming four coal fields from companies that had not made sufficient progress in mining. mr jayaswal, the businessman, is based in the city of nagpur, where he has developed a close relationship with the local lawmaker, mr darda. in a statement released by his company, mr jayaswal denied any wrongdoing and predicted his company would be exonerated. ""the investigation is on, and the company is fully cooperating,"" the statement said. ""the truth will ultimately prevail."" one nagpur businessman, a longtime acquaintance of mr jayaswal's, said many people were puzzled at how quickly he had amassed his fortune, despite having set up only one small power plant, even as his other projects remained in planning stages or were just breaking ground. mr jayaswal is building a large house in nagpur and hosted his two children's weddings in phuket, an island in the south of thailand. for his daughter's wedding, mr jayaswal flew in 350 friends, business associates and politicians for an event that was featured on the popular indian television program ""my big fat indian wedding."" ""he flaunts his wealth, and he lives a rich life,"" said the businessman, who asked not to be identified to protect his relationship with mr jayaswal. ""he is, in the last five or six years, suddenly into very big money."" during that period, mr jayaswal was regularly in the company of mr darda, who became a business partner, and other politicians. he has been linked to the powerful opposition leader, lk advani, and one photograph shows him presenting flowers to sonia gandhi, president of the congress party. last year, mr jayaswal appeared at india's presidential palace for the release of a new coffee-table book, ""the global indian,"" which praised his company. another businessman, who also has been allotted coal fields, said relationships with politicians served as a ""master key"" enabling industrialists to gain access to natural resources. he argued that mr jayaswal had merely played by the government's rules and that banks would lend only to companies with guaranteed access to raw materials. ""if you were in his position, you would do the same thing,"" the businessman said, asking not to be identified because his company also received coal fields and did not want to draw attention to himself. ""in this country, it's difficult to survive. whoever has a master key wants to eat up all of india. whoever doesn't have a key is struggling to survive."" copyright@ 2012, the new york times news servicegoogletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display(""adslotnativevideo""); });",0.043985682933051364,foreign media coal scam crony capitalism,"business rivals never fully understood manoj jayaswal got rich fast , except often seemed joined hip powerful politicians. hosted lavish parties , entertained daughter ' opulent thai wedding stood among india ' presidential palace , year ago praised leader india growth story. mr jayaswal embroiled $ 34 billion coal mining scandal exposed ugly underside indian politics economic life : brazen style crony capitalism enabled politicians friends reap huge profits gaining control vast swaths country ' natural resources , often nothing.

record straight and take the liberty of reminding you of the fact which are within your knowledge and of which the corroboration exists.the trigger point of this letter is the remark made by you to

""you did not contradict me in court"". sir, you are aware that on the contrary, the truth is otherwise. it was i who did not contradict you in the court.you will kindly recall the sequence of facts during hearing that took place on 12th march, 2013 in respect of item no 11 in court 5. i had entered the court room little late as i was on legs before some other court. during the hearing when you

allocation of coal blocks, you not only exhibited ignorance of facts stated in the status report which you had earlier perused, but had made a statement that what is stated in the status report was not to your knowledge and the same was not shared with the government. in fact, during the course of hearing, i was also called upon to show you those relevant paragraphs from the copy of status report that was made available to me during the course of hearing by the cbi officials instructing me in the matter. the same was shown to you in the court.the order dated 12 march, 2013 records a

affidavit in compliance of order dated 24 january or should a status report be filed. the meeting was attended by you sir, besides director cbi and jt director op galhotra amongst others. you will recall that i had reiterated my position namely that the statement made and recorded in the order dated 24 january to make known to the court the status of investigation through an affidavit of a competent officer was made not only after due consideration and discussion held with me by cbi officials on 23 january, 2013 prior to the hearing, but also on instruction received by me from them as well as instruction reiterated to me in the court. having reiterated my stand, i was a silent spectator when a decision was taken to file a status report instead of an affidavit which was to be shown to you as was decided in the meeting.googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display(""adslotnativevideo""); });you will also kindly recall that on 6th march, 2013 while i was in court, i received a message from your end, asking me to see the law minister at 12.30 pm with the status report. the message received by me was forwarded to the jt director, cbi by me. you were also present when i reached slightly late. you would also kindly recall at the said meeting during the course of discussion the draft of only one of the status reports of one of the preliminary enquiry was shown to the honorable law minister and was perused by him as well as by you. certain suggestions were made, including by you, to the cbi, some of which were accepted. no suggestion emanated from me. you will kindly further recall that you wanted to leave to attend court for a mentioning matter, other status report of the investigation of 9 regular cases were requested by you to be shown to you in the evening at about 4.30 pm. i was also asked to be present at your residential office. after you left, i left shortly thereafter and i also had to attend a mentioning matter at 2 pm. in compliance of the above, the cbi officials brought the drafts which were perused and settled by you sir. i was present in your residential office.you had also asked me to mention the matter on 7th march which was not possible for me on account of personal reasons. the matter was mentioned on 8th march by me to seek permission to file status report in sealed cover. you had remained present during the mentioning. as a matter of fact, if my memory does not fail me, it was submitted by you that, the status report contains much more details than what could be known to the court by an affidavit to be filed in compliance of order dated 24 january.despite the above facts while replying to the queries on 12 march as to what was contained in the status report, you had deemed it appropriate to take a stand that the contents of the status report were not known to you, which fact you knew to be incorrect. on account of your statement, i felt embarrassed and was forced to take a stand in the court consistent with your submission made as attorney general for india that the contents of the status report were not known to you and that they were not shared with the government.it has constantly pained and anguished me that i have to face unnecessary indignation on account of your intolerant temperament towards conscientious discharge of duties especially in high profile cases. i have held

2013-10-24,"full transcript: pm's on-board briefing while returning from visits to russia, china","on board pm's special aircraft: prime minister manmohan singh addressed the media after his visits to russia and china. dr singh spoke about the series of ceasefire violations by pakistan, the coal scam probe and india's relationship with china and russia.here is the full transcript of the media interaction:prime minister: ladies and gentlemen, you have been briefed extensively on the visits to russia and china, so i won't go into the details. my visit to russia was primarily for the annual summit. russia is, for us, a key strategic partner in many areas, including defence, energy and trade. we also have important convergences in a number of areas of regional and international interest. my visit has renewed my confidence in the strength of this relationship.in china, my visit was to follow up on the process of getting to know the new chinese leadership better. china is our largest neighbour, a significant economic partner and a country with increasing global presence. while we have our differences, there are many areas, bilateral, regional and multilateral, where cooperation among us is to our mutual benefit. it is only through a process of intense engagement that we will be able to move forward in all areas. i am satisfied that my just concluded visit has served its purpose.any questions which you would like to ask ?question: sir, during this china visit, as a part of the nine historic agreements, you have also signed some crucial and landmark cross-border river agreement also. at the moment you represent north-east. what is the likely impact of this agreement for our north-eastern states?pm: well, because i represent the north-east, i have been emphatic that cooperation between china and india in matters relating to the trans-border river system should proceed forward. i have been discussing this earlier also with the chinese leadership. i raised this issue again and there is incremental progress. they have agreed to supply data for more number of days. also they have recognized that the behaviour of the trans-border river system is of interest to all riparian states. so, our concerns have been put on the table. i hope there will be progress in years to come.question: the chinese leadership termed the visit as very successful, so how do you term your visit to china and compare the two visits to russia and china?pm: both these visits have served their purpose. i am satisfied with the results that we have been able to secure, both in russia as well as in china.question: our relations with pakistan haven't really gone well given the sustained attacks on our border and the meeting in new york which did not go well. with that going down the tube, do you believe that with china we stand a chance with this new border agreement, possibly of settling the border issue at some stage and having peace and tranquillity in that sector?pm: there is a commitment on the part of both china and india that peace and tranquillity on the border is a pre-requisite for progress in our relationship. so, there is this recognition and on the whole there has been peace and tranquillity on the indo-china border. so, i am reasonably satisfied that the chinese leadership is as serious as we are in ensuring peace and tranquillity on the india-china border.question: sir, you have mentioned at least on a couple of times, and in fact, this morning that terrorism, extremism and radicalism emanating from the region is a matter of concern. what was the response of the chinese government on the concerns that we have on terrorism, india has on terrorism from the region.pm: both in russia and china i found growing recognition that terrorism is a threat to all the countries of the region and that terrorism and extremism both are enemies of progress, that we must work together, pool our intelligence and information system to deal with this menace.question: its been over three weeks since you met pakistan's prime minister nawaz sharif in new york. firing, prime minister, has not only increased at the loc but also along the international border, are you disappointed with nawaz sharif and if pakistan continues to fire, how should we respond prime minister?pm: let me say that i am disappointed, because in the new york meeting there was a general agreement on both the sides that peace and tranquillity should be maintained on the border, on the line of control as well as on the international border and this has not happened. it has come to me as a big disappointment. we had agreed at that meeting that the ceasefire which was made effective in 2003, if it has held ground for 10 years, it could be made to hold ground later on also. the fact that this is not happening, is something which is really a matter of disappointment. i sincerely hope that at this late hour prime minister nawaz sharif will recognize that this is a development which is not good for either of the two countries.question: sir, i have a national question. from the last few weeks or months we are telling by the cbi, the cbi has the right to interrogate the prime minister. don't you think that you have given so much autonomy to them, they are crossing the laxman rekha?googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display(""adslotnativevideo""); });pm: well, let me say that this matter is now in the courts and i wouldn't like to comment on that.question: sir, i know, a day before this departure, prime minister's office did issue a clarification, there was nothing wrong with the hindalco allocations. but after you have left india, there have been demand, coming in particularly form the opposition that why shouldn't the prime minister also be open to interrogation, at least questioning by cbi, are you open to questioning by the cbi?pm: i am not above the law of the land. if there is anything that the cbi, or for that matter, anybody wants to ask, i have nothing to hide.question: sir, yesterday rahul gandhi has spoken about that there is possibility that he could also be killed the way his grandmother and father were killed. government, does it have any information of any threat to him or anybody targeting him or is it the hate politics of the opposition parties that are making him say that?pm: well, i and all sane persons should be worried about the politics of hate which is now sweeping our country. as regards, the threat to the life of rahul gandhi, government will take all possible precautions that this threat does not materialize.question: over the last few years, the supreme court has been very active in ordering and monitoring probes in the various alleged corruption scandals as well as laying out policy directions. do you think that overactive role of the supreme court is helping the executive in dealing with issues or is it contributing to what your critics term policy paralysis.pm: i wouldn't like to go into what is happening in the court. the supreme court is the final court of our country. i wouldn't like to comment on what the court does or what the court does not.question: sir, you have responded to a couple of questions on cbi cases regarding coal allocations. your statement before we left for russia was very categorical. statement said that there was no wrong doing in the case referred to by cbi regard to kumarmangalam birla and the case against former coal secretary. but sir, all these cases, and you also say that you are not above the law, you are open to answering to questions from anyone. but do all these cases which have acquired a certain political colour, are these cases in some ways, casting shadows on your prime ministership and your legacy at the 10 years at the helm of this country.pm: that is for history to judge. i am doing my duty. i will continue to do my duty. what impact my 10 years of prime ministership will have is something which is for historians to judge.question: india and china seek for further liberalisation of visa regime. can we expect any positive steps in the near future.pm: that's an aspiration that we both have and i hope we can find workable mechanisms to realise that goal.question: i have a question on domestic politics. the bjp campaign seems to be up and running for 2014 elections, the congress party is slow on the off take. how do you expect to meet this challenge?pm: well, i think the congress party is quite active. i don't share your view that the congress party is not active enough. i think the bjp may have started early but i think it will also peak early and slow and steady, i think, is the thing which sometimes works in public life as well and i am confident that congress party will come out victorious in the 2014 elections.question: division of andhra pradesh now seems to be not a smooth affair going by the resistance of the people and the congress leadership including cm of andhra pradesh. are you confident of granting statehood before 2014 elections by solving tricky issues like hyderabad?pm: the matter is now before the group of ministers. they are going into all aspects of the problem and i am sure they will come out with viable solution to this very difficult and complicated problem.question: sir, in last 9 years, there has been 2g scam, cwg scam, coal scam and then there was a big issue of price rise and also resignation of two senior ministers. do you think these kind of things have hit your credibility, particularly upa-ii and because your credibility is low, the people like narendra modi , his popularity is rising. can you help us analyse this?pm: first of all, i would say the 'scams' that you are referring to, took place not in upa-ii, they took in upa-i. after that we had a general election. the congress party won in that election hands down and i am sure when the result of 2014 gets out, country will once again be

2013-10-26,"truth vs hype: hindalco, the prime minister's office and pc parakh- being economical with the truth","new delhi: the cbi's latest fir into the allotment of the talabira ii coal block to hindalco, a company of the aditya birla group, has triggered a fresh crisis for the upa government. the fir alleges that the government initially rejected hindalco's bid for talabira ii, a block located in odisha, allotting it instead to the public sector company neyveli lignite, but says decision was reversed after kumara mangalam birla wrote to prime minister manmohan singh and subsequently met coal secretary pc parakh. the fir directly names mr birla and mr parakh, but refers indirectly to the prime minister as the ""competent authority"" who ultimately cleared the reversal. the prime minister was also holding the coal portfolio at that time. the cbi has not implied quid pro quo, instead registering an fir under a weaker provision of the anti-corruption law, which states that even if through their actions a public servant unduly benefits either themselves or another party, it constitutes a penalty under section 13 (1) (d) the prevention of corruption act. the birlas have denied any wrongdoing, saying that it is routine for their chairman to meet top officials, and that hardly amounts to influencing policy.even so, the fir has prompted calls from the bjp asking the prime minister to resign. the pmo on the other hand claims no wrongdoing, and that the rules were adhered to.the reality may be more nuanced. a closer reading of facts suggest several loopholes in the defence provided by the prime minister's office (pmo), but it's unclear whether it amounts to conspiracy, or a series of deviations from official policy. for starters, the pmo's defence nowhere mentions a key reason cited by the multi-level government screening committee, headed by mr parakh, for rejecting hindalco's application for talabira ii.the committee says hindalco's application was rejected since it had already been granted a mine, talabira i, for a project expansion which never took place.moreover, the committee found that hindalco was mining talabira i and diverting the coal for an older project, which amounts to a potential violation of the terms of allotment. when asked if coal india, the government coal supplier, had brought this diversion to his notice, mr parakh admitted that they did but instead of taking action against hindalco, he told coal india that it was a good thing for them since they didn't have to supply coal to a private player at a time of acute shortage. the pmo's defence says that the main reason for reversing the decision was because of a strong recommendation by the odisha chief minister naveen patnaik in hindalco's favour, an argument not backed by the facts. a reading of the minutes of meetings of several screening committee's in that same period suggest that the recommendations of state governments have been routinely overturned. for instance, in a screening committee meeting in september 2006, the madhya pradesh government asked for the brahmapuri coal block for a madhya pradesh-based company called satna power, but the committee awarded it to a chhattisgarh-based company called pushp steel. there are several such instances. the pmo goes on to say that the reversal caused no loss to the public sector units, since the talabira ii block was merged with another block, talabira iii and this combined entity shared between the psu mahanadi coalfields (mcl), neyveli lignite, and hindalco at a ratio of 70:15:15. the government admits that this brought down neyveli's coal supply to less than 30 per cent, but that neyveli was asked to form a joint venture with mcl which the government says would have met neyveli's shortfall. googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display(""adslotnativevideo""); });what the pmo neglects to mention is that even under the j/v, neyveli would still have to buy the additional coal from mcl, while earlier it would have got it virtually for free. government spokespersons were unable to explain this anomaly. mr parakh accepted that there is a financial loss to neyveli, but said 'even if neyveli had to pay little more money for taking coal from mahanadi coal, it had nothing wrong. i think it is a fair decision.'when asked how he thinks it is fair to reduce the share of a psu in a coal block by almost 70 per cent, he made a provocative contention. he said, ""we must understand that entire captive coal mining policy was designed to bring the private sector into coal mining in the country and not meant for public sector companies because they have option of taking coal in any other area which is not reserved for captive mining.""in fact, he says that while hindalco was eligible from the outset, he favoured neyveli since it was a psu, and that he had to virtually invent reasons for rejecting hindalco's application. later, when mr birla met him, mr parakh says he accepted his bias and reversed the decision. taken at face value, mr parakh's replies suggest the talabira reversal might be the result of highly unconventional decisions by an independent-minded coal secretary who was willing to bend the government's own rules if he felt it came in the way of opening up the coal sector. his words carry weight because he is on record for having actively pushed for a more transparent bidding based process, which was repeatedly stymied by all stakeholders in coal allotment: the central and state governments, and industry bodies. the cbi's contention that the reversal was a conspiracy to benefit a private individual will require more proof than the agency has currently declared. but this doesn't mean that it's on a weak wicket with the other fir's it has filed for wrongdoing in the coal allotment process. most of these relate to 2006-2009, the period after mr parakh left office (he retired in december 2005). this was the time the government allotted a record number of coal blocks, even as it dithered over changing over to a bidding based system, a process that took 6 years since it was first proposed. the coal minister for much of this time was the prime minister. prashant bhushan, one of the petitioners in the coal allocation case says that he doesn't doubt the prime minister's personal integrity but says that unless the cbi questions him, the answers to why the process of change took so long, and how these blocks were wrongfully cleared, will remain unanswered.
