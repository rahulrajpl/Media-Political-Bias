(do) you belong to the minority? well, the markets were up in the beginning of the year because of the fii money that came in and that was prompted by three factors. one was the excess liquidity created by the longer-term refinancing operations (ltro). second was very cheap rupee and third was a very cheap equity market. so, if we get our policy framework right then the fundamentals in the economy may improve. but given the fact that the investment economy has no legs left and since income is slowing, only the fii flows can boost the markets. how are the markets going to react?we have got a very high current account deficit, fiscal deficit and persistent inflation. so consumption boom would allow us to import a lot but since we haven’t created an infrastructure framework, it is not allowing us to export the goods. so if the economy does well, our current account deficit will collapse. hence, you get a currency shock in the system, which hampers growth. so, right now we are going through one of those periods of shocks. however, we have got very unfavorable economic trends ahead of us. so this kind of a slowing economy is not going to give you any growth impetus. there are lots of economic headwinds still facing the economy. i’m not seeing bold policy decision making given the fact we have elections in 2014. what will be the reaction of the market? tomorrow is going to be a big day for markets. markets can either go up or down. whichever way the markets go, in the next 2-3 days, they will trade the opposite way. however, flows are going to be the big driver. if the flows turn negative and the rupee continues to depreciate then the trend for this week is negative. what’s the impact of the election outcome on the rbi policy and union budget? the rbi is been looking towards the government to improve the fiscal situation before they start planning any cuts on interest rates. i don’t believe that the rbi will cut rates in mid-march. in fact, it will start cutting rates from april because it is not only about what it is in the budget but how credible it is and one would like to see what it does to price actions. food inflation has come off a bit but manufacturing inflation is still holding up. even the rbi governor is concerned on the fiscal situation of the economy.googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display(""adslotnativevideo""); });",0.05963686426951735,poll results may impact market short term : idfc mf md,"mumbai : highlightsnaval bir kumar , managing director idfc mutual fund told ndtv profit election results short term yet sentimental impact market. window._pricee = window._pricee &#124; &#124; [ ] ; _pricee.push( { container : ' _pcwgtmid ' } ) ; naval bir kumar , managing director idfc mutual fund told ndtv profit uttar pradesh election results short term yet sentimental impact market. believes policy paralysis indian economy likely end soon. “the rbi hoping government improve fiscal situation. central bank cut rates mid-march , april , ” said. interview. also watch accompanying video.how important results tomorrow ? all. election results clearly sentimental short term impact markets. expected uttar pradesh elections would strengthen upa. would get much policy action , start benefiting fundamentals economic development. view , politics divorced economics still impact. last year political economy … yes , election impact economy , especially indian economy policy. policy india exceedingly slow. get policy framework changed , larger impact economy. lot things happen behind scenes indian economy. , political results share economy becomes important. lot people said election results impact markets significantly.

2012-03-07,how up election result can change political equations at centre,"new delhi: the congress' lukewarm performance in uttar pradesh has shaken up the party by proving that rahul gandhi was not able to win over voters who were desperately seeking change. they ignored the congress and opted instead for the samajwadi party. the change of guard in lucknow is being felt already in delhi. bjp leader sushma swaraj told ndtv that she believes mid-term elections are likely for the country. the general elections are scheduled for 2014, but ms swaraj says the seat count shows a weakened congress incapable of serving any longer as the pivot for the upa coalition at the centre. she also pointed to how the clear mandate for the samajwadi party could reshape the alliance. samajwadi chief mulayam singh yadav can form the government on his own in up and doesn't need an alliance with the congress as a plan b. that gives him huge leverage at the centre, where his party lends support to the upa on important votes in parliament. the recent friction within the upa was also highlighted by ms swaraj. she pointed to a series of outbursts against the centre from mamata banerjee, who is the largest party in the upa after the congress. the bjp, she said, reads into this signs of an early election. she said that though her party will not steer events towards a mid-term poll, she believes the bjp is ready for a general election.the congress lost heavy bids for power in up and punjab, where it had assumed a long tradition of anti-incumbency would bring it to office. instead, the state has, for the first time, re-elected the party in power, the shiromani akali dal. the electoral failures come at a time when the congress has been enervated by a series of corruption scandals. a good performance could have helped revive its credibility as well as its authority in an increasingly fragile coalition. lately, the congress has been slammed for its policy paralysis. in the rajya sabha or upper house, it is in a minority. 58 seats will fall vacant in april; ten belong to up. a strong showing by the congress could have helped it push its overall tally up in the rajya sabha, where it is dependent on allies like ms banerjee to help pass crucial legislation.instead, an increasingly defiant ms banerjee has blocked reform in retail which marked an initiative by the prime minister. last month, ms banerjee led a campaign to block the centre's proposal for the new national counter terrorism centre or nctc. she sided openly with nine other chief ministers who head non-congress governments in their states. they allege that the nctc's mandate violated the principles of federalism by stomping upon the rights of states to handle law and order. ms banerjee's show of fraternity with chief ministers like odisha's naveen patnaik has provoked speculation about plans for a third front which would combine parties like ms banerjee's and mr patnaik's with chandrababu naidu's tdp in andhra pradesh.googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display(""adslotnativevideo"");

2016-11-23,notes ban beats modi's holograms as campaign gold," by now, there is consensus that the execution of the demonetisation move has been poor, and a significant cost has been inflicted on the whole population. this has resulted in physical hardship and in some cases, death. also, no one except the most partisan would doubt that the move has hurt the average person economically and the poor significantly so, by drying up trade and commerce due to currency shortage. there is no doubt that this move will have a recessionary effect in the short-run. the worst hit has been the unorganized sector where cash is king, and plastic means bags to carry goods, not credit or debit cards. acknowledging the poor execution, and the costs on the average person, can one still make a case that the policy will be successful in terms of its stated objective, namely to curb black money?the answer is: no. at best, demonetisation would have as much a lasting effect on curbing black money as a one-time effort to remove piles of garbage would have on the quality of sanitation and hygiene. unless the system of waste management and civic-standards change, a one-time clean up drive would have little impact beyond the very short-run. black money generation is a continuing process that involves evading taxes and regulations, and engaging in corrupt and criminal activities. cash is just one of many ways to store the stock of wealth that is created as a result. the following assumptions need to be true for a one-time strike like this one to make a dent on the problem: cash is the main form in which ill-begotten wealth is stored, and those who engage in these activities will fear that the government will keep on taking similar actions from time to time, and will not be able to find other ways of storing the wealth. both assumptions are unrealistic.first, the connection between cash and black money is at best tenuous. reports such as this and this suggest that only a small fraction of black money is held in cash. one can deal in and store black money by not using cash at all - for example, one can use gold, real estate, financial assets, or foreign exchange. also, given that only 1% of indians actually pay income taxes, while 2.3% file tax returns, and most transactions escape the net of sales tax, excise duty, or vat, most innocuous transactions technically involve black money (other than agricultural income that is legally tax-exempt). second, since it is unrealistic to expect the government to keep on repeating this exercise, the system will find a new equilibrium and all the activities that generate black money will go on. and to the extent they use cash (e.g., bribery, political donations, real estate), they will go on using the new currency notes. in fact, the rs 2,000 denomination will make it easier, not harder to use black money, by the government's own logic. it is true that economists such as ken rogoff and larry summers have argued for clamping down on high-denomination bills in developed countries, where plastic or electronic transactions are accessible to almost the whole population. however, since that is not the case in india, they themselves have noted (for example, here), that this argument does not apply to the present move.therefore, ironically, this reform may even increase the stock of black money held in cash in the future by facilitating hoarding in currency notes of a higher denomination. more generally, as necessity is the mother of invention, this move will act as a spur for those who engage in illegal activity to come up with alternative methods of transaction (think of an electronic hawala network like paytm for black money!) and storing of wealth. the only way this policy may have some bite on future corruption is if people believe that this move, however imperfect, is an advance firing shot hinting at a series of future reforms aimed at curbing corruption and is more a signal of intent on the part of the government than something that will be effective by itself. that is what the government has stated to be the case, but even the think tank that supposedly provided the idea behind the move is reportedly disappointed with a set of complementary reforms not being carried out. even if the policy of demonetisation has been proven costly, and is likely to be economically ineffective or even counter-productive, it is a brilliant move as a political campaign. earlier innovations like the use of 3d images of mr modi during the 2014 campaign, being the first major national leader to leverage social media like twitter, or posing with a broomstick during the swachh bharat abhiyan pale into insignificance given the universal and compulsorily participatory nature of this particular move. there are three major reasons for this:googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display(""adslotnativevideo""); });first, while this policy itself will do little to curb black money in the long run by itself, it does have a great signalling value. it is impossible to deny that a politically risky move like this, given the hardship it inflicts on ordinary voters, does indicate that mr. modi is serious about controlling some forms of corruption. second, currency notes are universally used and so if you pull people by this string, everyone is affected. no advertising campaign can accomplish 100% outreach, whether is through the media, rallies, or door-to-door campaigns. there is no greater pull than economic self-interest and that is why everyone will have to participate in this campaign, and in the process, form a view about the intent of the government. third, because its coverage is universal, ordinary voters will take some satisfaction in the rich and the powerful being inconvenienced along with them. also, as much as disasters are shown to generate a form of solidarity among those who are affected, however different their backgrounds are, this will create a popular consensus about the importance of curbing corruption and the government's seriousness about it. this is much more important than inconveniencing the cash-reliant campaigns of rival political parties in the up election, which has been suggested as one of the political reasons behind the move.the supposed magic of modinomics remains unproven. but moditics is a winner. being a four-term chief minister of gujarat was no fluke, nor was winning the 2014 elections by an absolute majority. the campaign for the 2019 election has begun.(maitreesh ghatak is professor of economics at the

2017-01-03,what akhilesh yadav said in morning's phone call with mulayam,"while akhilesh yadav has dealt a knockout blow to ""pitaji"" (father) in the bout to be declared the supremo of the samajwadi party (sp), both are also realising in danger of alienating voters, specially muslims who form a huge sp vote-bank. realising that losing the cycle brand and symbol might hurt both of them, the estranged father and son spoke for ten minutes on the phone this morning. the election commission has received competing claims from father and son on the party symbol – it could ban both from using it till it decides who is the rightful owner.sources say an angry and tearful mulayam singh accused ""tipu"" of ""betrayal"" and said that he had ""wrecked the party i have built"". yadav junior was conciliatory and kept repeating that he only wanted the ""trouble makers out who were nothing but agents of the bjp's amit shah"". the phone call was brokered by azam khan who is learnt to have told mulayam bluntly that he and the sp cadre could not choose between the father and son and the ""snake"" who had broken many families was trying to destroy the sp. no prizes for guessing that the snake reference was to the much-loathed amar singh. azam khan had earlier publicly said that ""amar singh ought to introspective why he was so hated"".the estranged father and son spoke on the phone this morningsources say mulayam heard khan, one of his oldest and closest aides, patiently.khan is learnt to have pointed out that while up muslims who can swing several up constituencies have an emotional connect with ""mullah mulayam"", they would not risk splitting their votes if yadav junior and senior formed two parties and competed against each other. in that case, the muslims would prefer to back another party - mayawati, mainly.khan's straight talk shook mulayam and after speaking to tipu, he decided to fly back from delhi to lucknow, leaving aides shivpal yadav and amar singh behind in delhi. apparently, the duo was visibly crestfallen after the father-son phone call. both are learnt to be in touch with mulayam singh's second wife sadhana gupta and daughter-in-law aparna yadav. sources say aparna yadav even tried to swing a meeting with prime minister narendra modi in lucknow yesterday. she has publicly praised modi earlier, causing much unease to akhilesh and leading him to file a complaint with his father.while modi had a huge rally yesterday in lucknow yesterday and publicly gloated at the size of the crowd, veteran up political watchers say only the media from delhi, who does not understand the nuances of up politics, cheerleads these ""events"" excellently arranged by bjp president amit shah.sources point out that shah is extremely worried about the muslim vote switching en bloc to mayawati, virtually making her position impregnable. mayawati has already selected 130 muslim candidates and is vigorously campaigning among these seats.a split in the samajwadi party could benefit mayawatiif no truce is brokered in the sp, and the party actually splits, the direct beneficiary will be mayawati, and she's upping the ante among the muslim voters saying only she can stop modi and the bjp from coming to power in uttar pradesh. interestingly, these days, she mocks note-bandi (demonetisation) and modi's good governance claims, and says she's the only one who can restore law and order, a noticeable failure in akhilesh's tenure as chief minister. he in turn passes the blame to shivpal yadav.in muslim-dominated constituencies, mayawati's meetings start with an azan or muslim call to prayer, and she stops speaking if it's prayer time, a noticeable departure from the past.so will father and son unite and ensure that they contest the elections together? azam khan has pointed out to both that the actual enemies are outside the party. 77-year- old mulayam has vaulting ambitions to be president of india, which amar singh and the bjp have both played to very cleverly by arranging quiet meetings with three top bjp leaders who nodded along as amar singh proclaimed ""only netaji can be rashtrapati.""googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display(""adslotnativevideo""); });but today, netaji realises that if the sp splits, he will be a nowhere man. even yadav junior understands the damage that will be wreaked by a divided cadre and in fighting the election with a new party name and symbol. akhilesh, while bitter at the treatment meted out by his father, realises that mulayam still has a huge connect with older rural voters and the muslims. the optics of contesting against his own father will not go down well with public perception.both father and son have carefully left enough ground to at least patch up publicly in a show of grace while conveniently blaming outsiders for the bout.the casualties in the patch up will be amar singh and the shivpal-aparna yadav faction. with his show of strength which drew thousands of party workers to the meeting called by him, akhilesh has publicly exposed the lack of base and support for shivpal yadav. as for amar singh, he's like a cat with nine lives and is still arranging secret meetings between netaji and the top leadership of the bjp. yadav junior will not accept singh's continuance at any price and those involved in the palace intrigue speculate that ""aparna yadav may just join the bjp which would be her natural home.”akhilesh has also noted with dismay the congress’ reluctance to offer him public support despite his open endorsement of an alliance. a partnership with the congress will be the price netaji is likely to extract from him as part of the patch-up and punishment for his coup.the election commission is likely to declare the dates for the up election tomorrow and the implications for the sp are obvious: if they unite, they are still in the fray; if divided, it’s advantage mayawati. so while a reconciliation may be cosmetic, it may not be elusive for much longer.(swati chaturvedi is an author and a journalist who has worked with the indian express, the statesman and the hindustan times.)disclaimer: the opinions expressed within this article are the personal opinions of the author. the facts and opinions appearing in the article do not reflect the views of ndtv and ndtv does not assume any responsibility or liability for the same.",0.035679693213939795,akhilesh yadav said morning ' phone call mulayam,"akhilesh yadav dealt knockout blow "" pitaji "" ( father ) bout declared supremo samajwadi party ( sp ) , also realising danger alienating voters , specially muslims form huge sp vote-bank. realising losing cycle brand symbol might hurt , estranged father son spoke ten minutes phone morning. election commission received competing claims father son party symbol – could ban using till decides rightful owner.sources say angry tearful mulayam singh accused "" tipu "" "" betrayal "" said "" wrecked party built "" . yadav junior conciliatory kept repeating wanted "" trouble makers nothing agents bjp ' amit shah "" . phone call brokered azam khan learnt told mulayam bluntly sp cadre could choose father son "" snake "" broken many families trying destroy sp. prizes guessing snake reference much-loathed amar singh. azam khan earlier publicly said "" amar singh ought introspective hated "" .the estranged father son spoke phone morningsources say mulayam heard khan , one oldest closest aides , patiently.khan learnt pointed muslims swing several constituencies emotional connect "" mullah mulayam "" , would risk splitting votes yadav junior senior formed two parties competed other. case , muslims would prefer back another party - mayawati , mainly.khan ' straight talk shook mulayam speaking tipu , decided fly back delhi lucknow , leaving aides shivpal yadav amar singh behind delhi. apparently , duo visibly crestfallen father-son phone call. learnt touch mulayam singh ' second wife sadhana gupta daughter-in-law aparna yadav. sources say aparna yadav even tried swing meeting prime minister narendra modi lucknow yesterday. publicly praised modi earlier , causing much unease akhilesh leading file complaint father.while modi huge rally yesterday lucknow yesterday publicly gloated size crowd , veteran political watchers say media delhi , understand nuances politics , cheerleads "" events "" excellently arranged bjp president amit shah.sources point shah extremely worried muslim vote switching en bloc mayawati , virtually making position impregnable. mayawati already selected 130 muslim candidates vigorously campaigning among seats.a split samajwadi party could benefit mayawatiif truce brokered sp , party actually splits , direct beneficiary mayawati , ' upping ante among muslim voters saying stop modi bjp coming power uttar pradesh. interestingly , days , mocks note-bandi ( demonetisation ) modi ' good governance claims , says ' one restore law order , noticeable failure akhilesh ' tenure chief minister. turn passes blame shivpal yadav.in muslim-dominated constituencies , mayawati ' meetings start azan muslim call prayer , stops speaking ' prayer time , noticeable departure past.so father son unite ensure contest elections together ? azam khan pointed actual enemies outside party. 77-year- old mulayam vaulting ambitions president india , amar singh bjp played cleverly arranging quiet meetings three top bjp leaders nodded along amar singh proclaimed "" netaji rashtrapati.

""i will enroll her in a private school next year."" saidun's family lives in fattepur, a village in the eastern uttar pradesh (up) district of mirzapur.like more than half (50.4 per cent) of all primary school-age children in up, saidun attends a government primary school (providing free education to children between 6 and 14 years), and like many children in the state, she cannot read at grade level.even though residents in two districts of up said education was important for the future of their children, only 2 per cent of voters surveyed listed education as the most important issue during the ongoing state assembly elections, according to a fourthlion-indiaspend survey. in conversations across the two districts, few villagers were willing to engage with the government system to improve the quality of education, in a state that accounts for 52 million or 21% of india's child population between the ages of six and 15 years. the low quality of education in the state (and dearth of jobs) puts india's future workforce at risk and is reflected in up's high unemployment.in 2015-16, more people per 1,000 were unemployed in up (58), compared to the indian average (37). youth unemployment was especially high, with 148 for every 1,000 people between the ages of 18 and 29 years in up unemployed, compared to the indian average of 102, according to 2015-16 labour ministry data.as many as 20 per cent of voters surveyed said jobs were the most important issue this election year, according to a fourthlion-indiaspend survey. between 2001 and 2011, over 5.8 million between the age of 20 and 29 years migrated from up in search of jobs, but, for most of these migrants, low educational attainment likely resulted in low-paying jobs in the informal sector.parents and children don't think they can change the education system though there is almost universal enrolment in primary schools in up - 25 million enrolled in grade i to v in 2015-16 - learning is challenged by the quality of education and high absenteeism. in 2016, about half (49.7 per cent) of grade i students surveyed in households in up could not read letters, while 44.3 per cent could not recognise numbers up to nine, according to the annual status of education report, a citizen-led assessment of learning in rural india.on average, only half the students of six schools in two districts were in class when indiaspend visited. parents in mirzapur district said they recognised their children were not learning much in school, but that they did not think they could change the existing system either through elections or by meeting local teachers and officials.teachers told indiaspend that low learning outcomes were mostly because of low attendance and little interest from parents to help their children at home. ""what should we say to education officials or candidates,"" asked ahmed, saidun's father. ""no one cares or talks about it. if they come here, they ask for votes and then leave.""""citizens face constraints in influencing public services,"" found a 2010 randomised evaluation of interventions to engage communities in education, conducted by researchers from the abdul jameel poverty action lab (j-pal), a network of 146 professors trying to reduce poverty through evidence-based policy, and pratham, a nongovernmental organisation.interventions that involve beneficiaries in improving public services have mixed results, the study further explained.there were three interventions as part of the j-pal study: the first facilitated meetings of villagers, teachers, and administrators, and disseminated information on the role of village education committees, a second also trained volunteers to administer literacy tests on children and prepare reports, and a third intervention trained volunteers to provide basic after-school reading classes to children.despite the fact that many parents attended meetings, and wanted to improve education levels, none of the three interventions significantly increased the village education committee or parents' involvement in schools or improved school performance, the authors found. children who were part of reading classes performed better than those who were not a part of the intervention.googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display(""adslotnativevideo""); });further, several parents are illiterate -- up's literacy rate or, the ability to read and write one's own name, is 70 per cent -- and these parents say they don't know how schools can be improved.""i haven't thought about how the school can be improved,"" said tukia devi, a tribal living near the bisunapur primary school in bahraich district, and mother to a five-year old daughter. ""i am illiterate, i don't know what can be done.""easier to improve education opportunities outside the government systemthe j-pal study suggested there seemed to be a greater willingness of individuals to help improve the situation for other individuals, rather than undertake collective action to improve institutions and systems.in april, at the beginning of the new academic year, ahmed, saidun's father, said he would move her to a private school, costing about rs 400 a month. ahmed is a driver, and earns between rs 4,000 and rs 10,000 a month, depending on the jobs he gets.about half of all children (46.5 per cent) in up study in private primary schools -- an increase of 80.6 per cent from 2007, according to the district information system for education.even when officials recognise that the major issue is learning levels, steps to change the status quo fall short. for instance, district officials in mirzapur district told indiaspend that goals this year included teaching students basic reading, math and writing.for that, officials would conduct random evaluations and check the level of students compared to a pre-decided goal set by the district, officials said. teacher training would be a focus with more trainings, but there did not appear to be a major redesign of the training itself.click here for more education news(except for the headline, this story has not been edited by ndtv staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)",0.14333246255660048,lack proper education system reason youth unemployment uttar pradesh,"new delhi : "" path mera alokit kardo , naval prath ki naval rashmiyon se , mere ur ka tam har , ( light path , morning sunlight light new sun , overcome darkness within heart. ) "" saidun ahmed , 8 , recited hindi poem dwarika prasad maheshwari , twentieth-century poet , top speed. asked read lines opposite page , fourth grader , dressed button-up full-sleeved brown shirt skirt-the school uniform government schools uttar pradesh-said memorised poem ' read well.

2017-02-27,"up election 2017: amid campaign, pm narendra modi has a message waiting...from varanasi","varanasi: highlightsbjp is banking on the varanasi seat, which will vote on march 8 varanasi, pm's constituency is divided into 3 assembly segments pm modi invoked lord krishna to explain his involvement with upwindow._pricee = window._pricee || []; _pricee.push({container : '_pcwgtmid'}); as the battle for up is underway, pm narendra modi has invoked lord krishna to explain his involvement with the state, ""krishna,"" he said ""was born in up but made gujarat his karma bhoomi. i was born in gujarat but up has adopted me"". and in up it is varanasi, his parliamentary seat, that he has made his political home. for the bjp, losing assembly seats in varanasi would be a major loss of face. varanasi polls in the final phase on march 8.for over five decades, sp singh, a banarsi businessman now in his seventies, spends his evenings with chai and gossip on dasashwamedh, arguably the most photographed ghat in the world. in 2014 lok sabha polls, mr singh, who is from an old congressi family, had voted for narendra modi. ""people of benares may have been swept up by the modi wave then, but voh ulti ganga bhee bahana jaantey hai (they know how to make the ganga flow backwards).' mr singh uses this idiomatic expression; which originates in the river's behaviour in benares, where it reverses its natural direction of flow, to indicate that the bjp could be in for trouble in its own bastion.varanasi south, varanasi cantonment and varanasi north are the assembly segments that form what people here call 'modi's garh.' all three are giving the bjp trouble. ""they know there's trouble, why else do you think (bjp president) amit shah would come and camp here,' says vinay tripathi, a local.for the bjp, nowhere is trouble greater than in the prestigious varanasi south seat. within its ambit lies much of what is quintessentially benares - the lanes of kashi vishwanath, the temple, the mosque, gowdhulia chowk, 41 ghats, the banarsi sari weaver mohallas. a shopkeeper in gowdhulia says, 'agar desh mein modi lehar thee, toh yaha dada lehar hotee hai' (if there is a modi wave in the country, here we have a dada wave.' dada is bjp's shyamdeo rai chowdhury, who has won this seat in seven consecutive assembly elections. he was denied ticket this time, a move that has become a biggest talking point. varanasi south, varanasi cantonment and varanasi north are called 'modi's garh.'in a tiny lane, off godhuliya, mr chowdhury's house, though newly refurbished, retains its simplicity and is known to have its doors open to the public (in the last few months mostly traversed by journalists). ""dada walks around with a paper and his stamp, if anyone needs anything, on the spot he will write a letter and stamp it. people want nothing more than getting their work done and he helps everyone,"" his neighbour tells us.in 2007, after delimitation changed the demographics of this seat, taking the number of muslim voters up to 80,000, ndtv had interviewed mr chowdhury on whether this would allow him to retain his winning streak. ""as long as i can meet my people, as long as i can walk down the steps of dashashwamedh ghat, the people of varanasi will not allow another. they will never betray me.""ironically, it was the same imagery and language that shyam deo chowdhury used talking to the media when the betrayal came from within, ""they tell me i'm too old to contest again but here i am, standing on my two feet. every day i walk across my constituency, to the ghats and am fitter than those younger than me. i should have been taken into confidence.'"" initially he voiced his protest strongly, denouncing the decision. over the past few days, with the bjp in full damage control mode, he has toned down his protest but is still not campaigning actively for the bjp candidate, neelkanth tiwari. mr tiwari's selection is directly being attributed to the rss. ''it's a well-known fact, that the rss has dictated several tickets in varanasi, that's been damaging to the party,"" says himanshu sharma, a local journalist. this change in guard is working in favour of congress' rajesh mishra. known for his ability to forge strong personal equations, even bjp supporters concede that mr mishra is putting up a tough fight. ""people will vote for him not the party,"" is the sentiment most often expressed about him, especially among a large section of the boatmen who live and work by the ghats in this constituency.googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display(""adslotnativevideo""); });in the past two decades, the nishads, a caste that encompasses more than 20 sub-castes who have traditionally lived off the river - malla, kevats, bind's kashyaps, sahnis have been successfully wooed by the bjp. one of the persons chosen to propose modi's nomination for the 2014 elections was a nishad. but now the nishads of this constituency are upset with the bjp's decision to construct a jetty at dashashwamedh ghat, which they feel will impact their livelihood.""modiji said that ganga maiya called him to her ghats and that's why he chose benares. but he's not been good to ganga maiya as son,' says pramod majhi, an official ma ganga nishad seva samiti. he argues that the proposed jetty is being constructed to provide a platform for people to watch the famous ganga aarti, held every evening on dashashwamedh ghat. traditionally, many visitors watch this aarti from boats, hired for this purpose. ""the government has succumbed to the demand of the pundits who have asked for it and who want to rob us boatmen of our earnings. rajesh mishra has opposed the idea of the jetty and he's always stood by us, so many of the nishads will vote for congress this time,"" mr majhi said.in the other seats - varnasi cantt - there's strong resentment against the bjp for fielding the son of the sitting mla, jyotsna srivastava. ""first we had her then her husband then it was back to her and now her son. since 1991, they have treated this like their personal fiefdom but even a zamindar does more work for his land,"" says ram narayan bind, a school-teacher from ranipur mohalla. in varanasi north, the bjp candidate, sitting mla ravindra jaiswal won last time by a narrow margin of just 2,336 votes, defeating bsp's sujit kumar maurya. mr jaiswal is pitted against mr maurya once again but it's the sp-congress candidate, abdul samad ansari who is giving jaiswal a tough contest. mr samad who won this seat on a samajwadi party ticket in 2007 is contesting on a congress ticket and has managed to ensure both cadres are working hard for him.over the last week, in the face of these challenges that threaten its hold over the city, the bjp has turned to the politics of religion to polarise voters, says sunil kashyap, a phd student at the benares hindu university. he displays whatsapp messages by bjp supporters that play on the words 'kabristan' (graveyard) and 'shamshan' (cremation ground), evoking the pm's february 19 speech at his fatehpur rally.this is generating its own response. we meet a sheher-e-mufti of benares, abdul batin nomani, a prominent muslim voice and member of sri kashi vishwanath-gyan vapi masjid sadhbavna trust, at his house situated near adampur thana is a typical, densely populated mohalla of weavers whose vote stands firmly with the congress-sp alliance. he doesn't take political questions directly but says that his appeal is that people vote for ""parties that have a secular approach and do not take positions for just one community"". an ardent bjp supporter says,"" one speech and pm modi can fix it all"".""we have compelled him (pm modi) to hold three rallies (tentatively slotted for march 5 in neighbouring mirzapur and jaunpur and march 6 in benares) back-to-back to save his garh (bastion),"" says ashok dubey, an old banarsi who is a bjp supporter.",0.11102718654801984,"election 2017 : amid campaign , pm narendra modi message waiting ... varanasi","varanasi : highlightsbjp banking varanasi seat , vote march 8 varanasi , pm ' constituency divided 3 assembly segments pm modi invoked lord krishna explain involvement upwindow._pricee = window._pricee &#124; &#124; [ ] ; _pricee.push( { container : ' _pcwgtmid ' } ) ; battle underway , pm narendra modi invoked lord krishna explain involvement state , "" krishna , "" said "" born made gujarat karma bhoomi. born gujarat adopted "" . varanasi , parliamentary seat , made political home. bjp , losing assembly seats varanasi would major loss face. varanasi polls final phase march 8.for five decades , sp singh , banarsi businessman seventies , spends evenings chai gossip dasashwamedh , arguably photographed ghat world. 2014 lok sabha polls , mr singh , old congressi family , voted narendra modi.

(the other bjp in charge of up is its rajya sabha mp, om mathur, who also, like mr bansal, is from rajasthan).mr bansal says he noticed three key weaknesses that he sought to fix - one, to remedy the party's poor rural outreach, the bjp fought panchayat elections in up in 2015, with a far greater intensity than before, contesting around 3000 seats. it only won about 350, but the exercise impelled it to create a village-level talent pool that would prove invaluable.two, in 2014, the party had a presence in less than a fourth of uttar pradesh's 1.4 lakh booths, the basic unit of election management. by late 2016, an aggressive membership drive had helped the bjp extend its reach to close to 1.28 lakh booths.""there are on an average 10 workers per booth,"" mr bansal told us. the bjp's rivals have been skeptical of these claims, suggesting many of these booth committees are padded with false entries. mr bansal said a call centre of 150 people, based out of lucknow, constantly dials workers to authenticate them; those that turn out to be ""ghosts"" are dropped.googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display(""adslotnativevideo""); });three, the above exercise allowed the bjp to remedy its image of a largely upper caste party. today, he claims close to 40% of its mid to lower level functionaries in up are from the other backward castes, and from the scheduled castes.

2017-03-11,the reasons for modi being stronger than ever," on this day, narendra modi coloured the ganga from source to varanasi in saffron in an astonishing victory that recalls the sweep of the 2014 general election and clearly allows the bjp to set the political agenda until the next general election in 2019 without much opposition. the people of up and uttarakhand, in giving the bjp a two-thirds majority in each state, have clearly stated that caste politics as it is existed thus far is dead, and modi's strategy of targeting the poor and downtrodden while keeping the middle class on board has worked brilliantly.in a sense, the paradigm of indian politics which has existed since mandalisation, has been changed, with modi being able to directly reach out to the poor with his policies of demonetization, direct subsidies like free gas cylinders, and a promise of a better tomorrow. demonetization, instead of becoming his achilles' heel, has actually been received as a pro-poor policy. in a sense, he has stolen the mantle of party of the poor from the congress and taken a large chunk of the bahujan samaj party or bsp's support, reducing them to a mere rump. and being a better orator than indira gandhi, he has emerged as the people's icon for garibi hatao.up and uttarakhand in a sense reflect what has happened in local elections across india, including the recent ones in maharashtra and odisha, where the bjp has out-performed. so these victories cannot be taken in isolation, but seem to show that the majority of voters believe that modi has delivered, and will continue to do so on his pro-poor policies.so while both the samajwadi party (sp) and bsp have seemingly managed to protect their core vote, the bjp has brought in more voters with up having the highest turnout in a up vidhan sabha elections of 60% in a growing electorate. along with that, the bjp, through modi, captured young voters who had been recently enfranchised and this, in turn, has diluted the percentage support for caste/religion-based parties. the new voter, who first surfaced in 2014, is looking for change and is seeing modi deliver change. and while the change modi has promised may not have positively impacted everyone, there is a positive impression that he is delivering for the poor. pm modi's super wave has ensured a majority government in the 403-seat statefor the sp, being reduced to 25% of their size compared to 2012, this is an unmitigated disaster and the blame game within the party has already started. akhilesh yadav will have to carry the brunt of it, for ""breaking"" the party as well as running a campaign that continued to push caste politics rather than putting out a single message that people could catch on to. similarly, the bsp will have to try and figure where it can go beyond just being for the dalits and muslims.and perhaps if you compare the goodies that modi gave versus those by akhilesh, you can see why modi understood the politics of the poor better. while both target specific castes, modi, by giving free gas cylinders under the ujjwala yogana to below poverty line families, was providing a life-changing object. at one stroke, the women of the house were relieved from collecting wood, suffering from smoke and freed for more productive work. it was a gamechanger for the family. akhilesh's laptops for students wasn't, it only benefited a small population, and brought minimal change. the same is true of the rs 1,000-per-month unemployment allowance and rs 500 senior citizens' pension. they did not change life for a whole household, and did not hold that promise for those not included. the congress in up is probably finished. the victory in punjab has provided them a fig leaf, and so may manipur and goa. but frankly, these results have little to do with the national leadership of the party or its programmes, policies or campaign styles. the victory in punjab is very much a victory for captain amarinder singh, and the fact that the akalis all but provided that state on a platter. captain grabbed that and pushed aside the challenge of the aap, and that must be seen as his, and perhaps sidhu's, success rather than a congress victory. the congress identified where aap managed to do well in the east malwa region in 2014 and recaptured this area. in goa, the party has managed to exploit anti-incumbency to come back into the political game. it has been helped by the fact that aap has failed.googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display(""adslotnativevideo""); });and that is the other story of this election. aap has failed. failed to win or even emerge as the largest party in punjab. with all the campaigning, the noise, the nris and the predictions, the aap has underperformed badly, very badly. it has done worse that it did in 2014 general election, losing more than 20% of their support. and partly its failure rests on its inability to really decisively cut into the akali vote. aap has done worse than it did in 2014 lok sabha polls because of its inability to cut into akali votethese two stories will have a great deal of impact on the party and its belief of capturing other states. next month, it faces municipal elections in delhi and the loss in punjab will weigh heavily in that city with a large punjabi population. in gujarat, where aap has been working for a while, these resounding defeats will make it difficult for aap to raise funds to fight modi. gujarat does not bode well for the congress either. with this overwhelming the victory in up, it is unlikely that that the gujarati voter is going to defect from the bjp. and in himachal pradesh, which also goes to the polls this winter, the congress is unlikely to stem the modi wave.nationally, the bjp is likely to meet less resistance in parliament now and should be able to press through its agenda, especially the gst. it will also be able to select and elect its own candidate for the president (and vice president), and improve its position in the rajya sabha after these unprecedented gains. this first victory in the gangetic plain after defeats in bihar and west bengal will give the bjp greater confidence in implementing its agenda without fearing any electoral impact. this election has put to bed any fear that the bjp may have had that of any challenge to its dominance.(ishwari bajpai is

""if a complaint has been raised, the government should look into it. i will also study this,"" he said.he is not short of material to scrutinize. whether entwining with the congress was an unforced error is arguable. akhilesh yadav said recently that the alliance was formed when he was operating from a position of weakness, trapped in a long and public fight with his father, mulayam singh, for control of the samajwadi party. mulayam singh, 77, was categorical that a collaboration with any party, including the congress, was unacceptable. akhilesh yadav felt differently. at a time when his party was riven by his family feud, he felt that the congress would help consolidate the crucial muslim vote, which accounts for 18 per cent of the population and serve as a beta blocker for the momentum generated by pm modi. oops. not only did the congress fail to pull its own weight, but it also served as an ankle-weight for samajwadi candidates, who say the congress' votes did not transfer to them. up election results 2017: akhilesh yadav earned the distinction of being vanquished in the stateapart from counter-pointing his father, akhilesh yadav's predisposition to combining with the congress was based on his famed friendship with rahul gandhi, who is three years older than him and is his party's no 2. mother and congress chief sonia gandhi left election decisions to him and his sister, priyanka gandhi vadra, who was credited publicly by the party for salvaging the alliance from busting over how many seats the congress would be allotted. it got 105, vastly disproportionate to both its result in the last election in 2012 and its depleted stature since. as exit polls on thursday forecast a bjp win (though only two correctly called an outright landslide), akhilesh yadav said, in a reversal of stand, that should the need arise, he was open to seeking an alliance with mayawati.the samajwadi-congress combine came to be etched too firmly in voters' minds as narrowly focused on the muslims and the yadavs and drove a consolidation of the hindu vote for the bjp.googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display(""adslotnativevideo"");

2017-03-17,"blog: bjp has won uttar pradesh, but is short of options for chief minister"," the bjp moved with tyre-burning speed to clinch numbers and power in goa and manipur, where the verdict wasn't purely in its favour. one chief minister has already won a trust vote, another will get there soon. but in uttar pradesh, where the party uprooted all opposition in a landslide victory, the bjp is on a go-slow. it is yet to name a chief minister.five days after its sweetest win, the bjp said today that its 312 mlas in uttar pradesh will meet on saturday, march 18, at 5 pm and the chief minister will be finalised. the newly elected mlas will effectively endorse the name of the person prime minister narendra modi and party president amit shah will pick for up's top post.the decision is crucial and difficult. winning up was phase one and a part of preparation for phase two - the 2019 national election. while the party's traditional support base, the general caste voters supported it as always, it also won new backers in the most backward castes and the non-yadav other backward castes and non-jatav dalits. these social groups form 55 to 60 per cent of up's voters and the bjp pulled away their support while the bahujan samaj party of mayawati and akhilesh yadav's samajwadi party were content consolidating their core support - jatav dalits for the bsp and yadavs for the sp - while they fought over the muslim vote.the party did not project a presumptive chief minister in the face of formidable opponents like mayawati and akhilesh yadav, both clear contenders for the top post, and still won handsomely. but after the win, comes the tough challenge of meeting the aspirations of those who voted for it. the first signal they await is the bjp's choice of chief minister. after the up elections, the top bjp leadership faces the challenge of selecting a chief minister.the bjp has poor bench strength in up. it has won 325 assembly seats along with its allies, yet all the probables for chief minister are drawn from its pool of parliamentarians. that is because it fielded all its biggest leaders from the state in the national election three years ago. so the names doing the rounds for up chief minister are union home minister rajnath singh, telecom minister manoj sinha, who is also junior minster for railways, and keshav maurya, the bjp's uttar pradesh chief and lok sabha mp.rajnath singh is a big name in the bjp. he has been party president twice - he led the bjp when the party projected narendra modi as its face for the 2014 national election and won. he was also party president when the party projected lk advani and lost in 2009. he has been up chief minister, state president and a minister in the atal bihari vajpayee government at the centre.rajnath singh is seen to possess the administrative skill and clean image that the party needs for the up top job. but rajnath singh, twice, last year declined pm modi and amit shah's offer to shift back to up if the bjp won. he reportedly said no as up seemed like a fortress that couldn't be won.a day before election results were announced last weekend, the rss and amit shah are said to have discussed rajnath singh's suitability for the job, but there is no clarity yet. the biggest factor in this decision will be how his place at the centre will be filled. a shift to lucknow may force a major shuffle in the cabinet. pm modi will have to hunt for a home minister, apart from a defence minister after manohar parrikar left to be goa chief minister. finance minister arun jaitley has been given makeshift charge of defence.rajnath singh is also a senior leader, number two at the centre and close to the rss. the prime minister is a member of parliament from up. if rajnath singh takes over as chief minister, his proximity to the rss could propel him to emerge as a major power centre in the bjp. will the bjp's top duo allow that? rajnath singh (second from left) has so far rubbished reports that he is a candidate for the top post in up.personally, rajnath singh may now fancy a stint in lucknow to emerge out of pm modi's shadow, where he has lived since may 2014 as home minister. he will get an opportunity to steer the state towards better times and if he manages a repeat of the 2014 elections, when the bjp won 71 of 80 seats, he will be positioned well. sources in the bjp say rajnath singh, who has always been very discreet, may have prime ministerial ambitions.but there negatives too that go with the job for mr singh. his son pankaj singh is now a legislator from noida. for the last two elections, he had refused to let the bjp field his son as he didn't want him in active electoral politics under his guard. if he becomes chief minister, his son's chances of becoming a minister will be nil.the bjp's biggest compulsion in deciding who will be chief minister is to strike the right caste balance between dalits-backwards and most backward castes (mbc) and general castes and make everyone happy. keshav maurya belongs to mbc maurya caste and was poor as a child like pm modi. he is an rss man and was an active member of the bjp's sibling in the sangh parivar - the vishwa hindu parishad. amit shah had handpicked him last year to be up chief and pm modi is said to back him.googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display(""adslotnativevideo""); });amid all the suspense, amit shah on thursday dropped a bombshell saying the ""party will endorse its state unit president's choice"". at the bjp headquarters in lucknow, mr maurya's supporters have been waiting for his name to be announced, but amit shah's words seem to cancel him. how will he pick himself for the top job? amit shah on thursday said bjp's up chief keshav maurya would select the chief minister.the bjp backed keshav maurya on ticket distribution and other election-related decisions, but there is always was a worry about his past. his political career, though impressive, also marked by nearly 50 criminal cases, including those of murder, promoting enmity between communities, intimidation and making hate speeches.many smirked at the lucknow bjp office when mr maurya was rushed to delhi's rml hospital complaining of an irregular blood pressure, after mr shah's comments.the bjp's brass knows it has promised the stars in the up elections and it needs a tough administrator with a clean record and acceptability among most sections as chief minster. who it picks in neighbouring uttarakhand will also matter. if the bjp chief minister in that state is an upper caste leader (the dominant segment in the state) then picking an upper caste man in up too will invite criticism that the party gets votes from all segments but goes back to the comfort zone of the upper caste for leadership.manoj sinha is a bhumihar, high on up's caste ladder. he has established his credentials as a good administrator and a no-nonsense man. in eastern up, he has a son-of-the-soil image despite his mtech from the benaras hindu university. he is considered low profile and a man who can work as part of a system, a trait preferred by pm modi and amit shah.there are others - dinesh sharma, the mayor of lucknow, non-controversial and low profile and who is the modi-shah duo's point man for gujarat. the name of others like long-time legislators suresh khanna and satish mahana too have been taken for, though a section in delhi says they could be in the running for the up assembly speaker's job given their experience.the bjp's silence on who will lead the bjp in uttar pradesh is stunning. not just the media, but even party workers are asking questions. the party has decided to keep workers engaged with a call for a victory celebration on saturday. meanwhile, ask anyone in the party and the standard reply is that only the prime minister and amit shah know.(rahul shrivastava is senior editor, political affairs ndtv 24x7)disclaimer: the opinions expressed within this article are the personal opinions of the author. the facts and opinions appearing in the article do not reflect the views of ndtv and ndtv does not assume any responsibility or liability for the same.",0.13657828282828285,"blog : bjp uttar pradesh , short options chief minister","bjp moved tyre-burning speed clinch numbers power goa manipur , verdict ' purely favour. one chief minister already trust vote , another get soon. uttar pradesh , party uprooted opposition landslide victory , bjp go-slow. yet name chief minister.five days sweetest win , bjp said today 312 mlas uttar pradesh meet saturday , march 18 , 5 pm chief minister finalised. newly elected mlas effectively endorse name person prime minister narendra modi party president amit shah pick ' top post.the decision crucial difficult. winning phase one part preparation phase two -

2017-03-17,"blog: bjp has won uttar pradesh, but is short of options for chief minister"," the bjp moved with tyre-burning speed to clinch numbers and power in goa and manipur, where the verdict wasn't purely in its favour. one chief minister has already won a trust vote, another will get there soon. but in uttar pradesh, where the party uprooted all opposition in a landslide victory, the bjp is on a go-slow. it is yet to name a chief minister.five days after its sweetest win, the bjp said today that its 312 mlas in uttar pradesh will meet on saturday, march 18, at 5 pm and the chief minister will be finalised. the newly elected mlas will effectively endorse the name of the person prime minister narendra modi and party president amit shah will pick for up's top post.the decision is crucial and difficult. winning up was phase one and a part of preparation for phase two - the 2019 national election. while the party's traditional support base, the general caste voters supported it as always, it also won new backers in the most backward castes and the non-yadav other backward castes and non-jatav dalits. these social groups form 55 to 60 per cent of up's voters and the bjp pulled away their support while the bahujan samaj party of mayawati and akhilesh yadav's samajwadi party were content consolidating their core support - jatav dalits for the bsp and yadavs for the sp - while they fought over the muslim vote.the party did not project a presumptive chief minister in the face of formidable opponents like mayawati and akhilesh yadav, both clear contenders for the top post, and still won handsomely. but after the win, comes the tough challenge of meeting the aspirations of those who voted for it. the first signal they await is the bjp's choice of chief minister. after the up elections, the top bjp leadership faces the challenge of selecting a chief minister.the bjp has poor bench strength in up. it has won 325 assembly seats along with its allies, yet all the probables for chief minister are drawn from its pool of parliamentarians. that is because it fielded all its biggest leaders from the state in the national election three years ago. so the names doing the rounds for up chief minister are union home minister rajnath singh, telecom minister manoj sinha, who is also junior minster for railways, and keshav maurya, the bjp's uttar pradesh chief and lok sabha mp.rajnath singh is a big name in the bjp. he has been party president twice - he led the bjp when the party projected narendra modi as its face for the 2014 national election and won. he was also party president when the party projected lk advani and lost in 2009. he has been up chief minister, state president and a minister in the atal bihari vajpayee government at the centre.rajnath singh is seen to possess the administrative skill and clean image that the party needs for the up top job. but rajnath singh, twice, last year declined pm modi and amit shah's offer to shift back to up if the bjp won. he reportedly said no as up seemed like a fortress that couldn't be won.a day before election results were announced last weekend, the rss and amit shah are said to have discussed rajnath singh's suitability for the job, but there is no clarity yet. the biggest factor in this decision will be how his place at the centre will be filled. a shift to lucknow may force a major shuffle in the cabinet. pm modi will have to hunt for a home minister, apart from a defence minister after manohar parrikar left to be goa chief minister. finance minister arun jaitley has been given makeshift charge of defence.rajnath singh is also a senior leader, number two at the centre and close to the rss. the prime minister is a member of parliament from up. if rajnath singh takes over as chief minister, his proximity to the rss could propel him to emerge as a major power centre in the bjp. will the bjp's top duo allow that? rajnath singh (second from left) has so far rubbished reports that he is a candidate for the top post in up.personally, rajnath singh may now fancy a stint in lucknow to emerge out of pm modi's shadow, where he has lived since may 2014 as home minister. he will get an opportunity to steer the state towards better times and if he manages a repeat of the 2014 elections, when the bjp won 71 of 80 seats, he will be positioned well. sources in the bjp say rajnath singh, who has always been very discreet, may have prime ministerial ambitions.but there negatives too that go with the job for mr singh. his son pankaj singh is now a legislator from noida. for the last two elections, he had refused to let the bjp field his son as he didn't want him in active electoral politics under his guard. if he becomes chief minister, his son's chances of becoming a minister will be nil.the bjp's biggest compulsion in deciding who will be chief minister is to strike the right caste balance between dalits-backwards and most backward castes (mbc) and general castes and make everyone happy. keshav maurya belongs to mbc maurya caste and was poor as a child like pm modi. he is an rss man and was an active member of the bjp's sibling in the sangh parivar - the vishwa hindu parishad. amit shah had handpicked him last year to be up chief and pm modi is said to back him.googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display(""adslotnativevideo""); });amid all the suspense, amit shah on thursday dropped a bombshell saying the ""party will endorse its state unit president's choice"". at the bjp headquarters in lucknow, mr maurya's supporters have been waiting for his name to be announced, but amit shah's words seem to cancel him. how will he pick himself for the top job? amit shah on thursday said bjp's up chief keshav maurya would select the chief minister.the bjp backed keshav maurya on ticket distribution and other election-related decisions, but there is always was a worry about his past. his political career, though impressive, also marked by nearly 50 criminal cases, including those of murder, promoting enmity between communities, intimidation and making hate speeches.many smirked at the lucknow bjp office when mr maurya was rushed to delhi's rml hospital complaining of an irregular blood pressure, after mr shah's comments.the bjp's brass knows it has promised the stars in the up elections and it needs a tough administrator with a clean record and acceptability among most sections as chief minster. who it picks in neighbouring uttarakhand will also matter. if the bjp chief minister in that state is an upper caste leader (the dominant segment in the state) then picking an upper caste man in up too will invite criticism that the party gets votes from all segments but goes back to the comfort zone of the upper caste for leadership.manoj sinha is a bhumihar, high on up's caste ladder. he has established his credentials as a good administrator and a no-nonsense man. in eastern up, he has a son-of-the-soil image despite his mtech from the benaras hindu university. he is considered low profile and a man who can work as part of a system, a trait preferred by pm modi and amit shah.there are others - dinesh sharma, the mayor of lucknow, non-controversial and low profile and who is the modi-shah duo's point man for gujarat. the name of others like long-time legislators suresh khanna and satish mahana too have been taken for, though a section in delhi says they could be in the running for the up assembly speaker's job given their experience.the bjp's silence on who will lead the bjp in uttar pradesh is stunning. not just the media, but even party workers are asking questions. the party has decided to keep workers engaged with a call for a victory celebration on saturday. meanwhile, ask anyone in the party and the standard reply is that only the prime minister and amit shah know.(rahul shrivastava is senior editor, political affairs ndtv 24x7)disclaimer: the opinions expressed within this article are the personal opinions of the author. the facts and opinions appearing in the article do not reflect the views of ndtv and ndtv does not assume any responsibility or liability for the same.",0.13657828282828285,"blog : bjp uttar pradesh , short options chief minister","bjp moved tyre-burning speed clinch numbers power goa manipur , verdict ' purely favour. one chief minister already trust vote , another get soon. uttar pradesh , party uprooted opposition landslide victory , bjp go-slow. yet name chief minister.five days sweetest win , bjp said today 312 mlas uttar pradesh meet saturday , march 18 , 5 pm chief minister finalised. newly elected mlas effectively endorse name person prime minister narendra modi party president amit shah pick ' top post.the decision crucial difficult. winning phase one part preparation phase two -
