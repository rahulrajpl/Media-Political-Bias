2016-08-30,"i want to pray at sabarimala, i am not #readytowait"," tradition is usually acknowledged as a thread that holds some aspects of a society together. it comes into existence for a reason. usually, the reasons die out with time, but the tradition lingers on and needs to be changed to suit the times. over the centuries, women have always been socially conditioned by various traditions and taboos to believe they are less than men and must obey rules that men need not. a woman's biological differences once made her vulnerable to being always under supervision. in some societies, this led to women being ostracized from certain aspects of life. even in kerala, which stands on a high pedestal in socialist pedigrees, we have a regressive past. we were the society which put a tax on a woman with breasts, we were the society which chased away the first woman actor on celluloid because she belonged to a marginalized community and dared to enact the role of an upper class woman. i can go on. there has always been stiff resistance to change of any sort, but especially to change of existing norms: remember how banning the horrific custom of sati, widow remarriage, and educating women were once considered blasphemy? the stiff resistances to these changes put up by the then privileged have been well-documented in history. but now i am talking about the current controversy about lord ayyappa's women devotees. dedicated to lord ayyappa, worshipped as a son of lord vishnu, the sabarimala temple allows entry only to girls younger than 10 or women over 55oh yes, i do understand the sastha and the ayyappa concepts. let me make it very clear that i am a born and practising hindu, and we have been ardent devotees of lord ayyappa. as a woman who is also a believer, i have strong feelings against what is obviously an imposed restriction on a woman devotee of productive age entering the sabarimala temple.here are some of the arguments that people have raised. some are connected to devotion, others plainly lack common sense and reflect not moving along with the times. argument 1. lord ayyappa is a celibate. so women of productive age should not visit the temple. i think that's a terrible insult to the concept of lord ayyappa. lord ayyappa is beyond temptations. it's a usual human error in interpretation that celibacy means isolation from temptations. celibacy is steadfastness to one's choices in spite of temptations. celibacy is about the person who chooses to be so, and not about the others around him. it's the devotees who have to resist temptations to emulate him to get nearer to the concept of god. that's why the 41-day-vrat from anything worldly is a part of the sabarimala pilgrimage. the restrictions on keeping women of a certain age away had once probably been about keeping women away from a tough trek up the hillock to the shrine, about the difficulty of travelling during menstruation. modern conveniences have altered all that.googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display(""adslotnativevideo""); });argument 2. women will not be able to hold the vrat for 41 days because of their period (required to enter the temple).really? is it not up to the devotee to ensure that she holds the vrat rather than someone supervising her commitment to god? age is not a factor that controls everyone's menstrual cycle, there are exceptions. there are so many women who have surgically removed their uteruses at younger ages due to health issues; they can surely take the vrat? and how about the tablets that women take to put off menstrual periods when the men in their house are on sabarimala vrat? they too take the oath of abstinence with their family. and surely the not-cutting-hair, not-shaving, alcohol restrictions etc. don't apply to an average woman? and if she violates any of these, surely whatever retribution follows comes to her alone? as for checking if a woman is ""in line,"" does anyone check if a man's observing a vrat? isn't a woman devotee owed the same respect? so don't even start to talk about weird ideas like machines to check the woman's ""purity"" - a temple official suggested a machine to scan whether women approaching the temple have their period.what i cannot stomach here in the whole deliberations is the concept that woman is ""impure"". this has been an age-old plot of patriarchy and used to control women. and then they glorify motherhood. why? it's women who carry on the race, and that's grudgingly acknowledged as the sole use of womanhood. #readytowait campaign supports sabarimala temple's tradition of not allowing women of reproductive ageas for my fellow-women who are #readytowait, i respect your decision to wait till you are 55. i expect you therefore to return the grace and respect the other women's decisions to not wait too. let not a man-made tradition in another century stand in their way. i see this movement to allow women to worship in sabarimala as a change. and a change of the order that puts an end to what i see as gender discrimination, and in concurrence with the supreme law of the land. if you cannot or do not choose to see that as discrimination, i am afraid you have just been socially conditioned to accept discrimination.

2018-10-21,why the sabarimala judgment should worry freedom-loving liberals,"by any standards, the stories emerging from the environs of sabarimala temple are extraordinary. women journalists are being attacked for daring to cover the story; the priests are threatening to shutter the temple; kerala cops are escorting women dressed in riot police gear to the door of the temple; the communist party of india is holding press conferences to discuss faith; the local congress is aligning itself with the rss; one of the women activists in the forefront of the agitation had her house in kochi vandalised; and the bjp is openly celebrating, hoping that this will be the turning point in its decades-long attempt to gain a foothold in kerala politics.the principles at stake seem clear. first, that people should not be barred from exercising their right to worship on the basis of their caste or their gender. and second, that a legal directive - in this case, the supreme court judgment opening the doors of sabarimala to all women - must be enforced. nobody can dispute these principles. and so i support the struggle of women activists to enter sabarimala. we all should, if we believe that india deserves to be a modern country. and yet there is, especially to those who care about individual rights, something disturbing about this entire process. the ""tradition"" that bars many women from entering the temple is not of any great age, but even so, it has settled into the complex of beliefs held by worshippers of the temple's deity, ayyappa. the supreme court has held that these beliefs are not protected. they are not, by implication, ""essential"" to the worshippers' faith. this is the first place we should start to worry; courts should not decide what is and is not essential to faith. they may have before - but that does not make it any less disturbing that they have. suppose next that they decide that a temple at ayodhya is ""essential"" to hinduism, but that a mosque there is not ""essential"" to islam? that would be no guide to settling a dispute over the ownership and control of a piece of land.kerala's sabarimala temple opened its doors to women of all ages on october 17.unquestionably, religious sanctions that forbid women or dalits or others from equal access to worship are wrong. but when we use the law to try and force religion to enter the modern world, we are going down a dangerous path. because, i fear, in a clash between law and religion at this particular, dangerous, moment in our history, it is not certain which will win. there is an older, better method to deal with such exclusions, one in which kerala has in the past specialised: social change, moral pressure, and religious reform. we have the right to choose to disbelieve, and to demand change. we have the right to worship elsewhere. these are the ways in which we must enforce change. i believe, as dr ambedkar did, that merely opening the doors of places of worship, through government action or otherwise, is not an answer to structural or religious discrimination. if the aim is equality, then it must be equality in the eyes of doctrine. anything less is insufficient. purge discrimination from religion, dr ambedkar told mahatma gandhi when he sought the former's support for the temple entry laws in the 1930s, or ""not only will the depressed classes reject the temple entry, they will also reject the hindu faith"".it is the right to reject faith that the framer of the constitution insisted upon, and it is that right we should strengthen and support. this is not to say that the hindutva objections to the supreme court judgment are right. there are many basic errors of logic or reasoning at their heart. on the one hand, it is argued that ""this is only one temple"", that it has special rituals and worshippers there have unique beliefs that should be protected. on the other hand, it is argued that anyone - such as the lingayats in karnataka - who stress their differences from the customs and practices that hindutva-vadis have declared ""orthodox"" are mistaken. this error is a natural consequence of the attempt to redefine a complex, naturally evolving system of contradictory and overlapping beliefs into something homogenous. if you want some temples to have the same rights that the constitution ascribes for good reason to minority faiths in order to protect cultural diversity, then you must also accept that their worshippers are de facto minorities in india.there is yet another basic error here. many argue - as i do - that the right to offend the religious is central to the right to free expression. several on the hindu right say this too, on the assumption that they will then have additional opportunities to insult and offend muslims. but if so, then the right to free expression and worship means that people cannot be forbidden from expression or worship in a manner that other people may view as sacrilegious. if the supreme court believes that sabarimala should be opened to all, even if some consider that sacrilegious, then it should also have read down any and all statutes - such as article 295a of the indian penal code - that prevent free speech about religion.even beliefs one disagrees with strongly deserve protection under the law, as long as they do not interfere with civil rights. triple talaq, and many other aspects of religious personal laws in india, may infringe on civil rights and thus deserve to be read down. but it is far less persuasive to argue that religious restrictions on entry or behaviour in a particular place of worship violate civil rights. my rights as a citizen there consist of the right to reject that belief, and criticise it - but little more.googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display(""adslotnativevideo""); });after all, on the street, i can go bareheaded, and i should roundly reject as infringing on my rights any requirement that i cover my head. but should i approach the courts and demand that the golden temple respect my right to not cover my head? i think not.protests are on to support the centuries-old ban on the entry of women of reproductive age into the templeone problem, of course, is that the indian state has inherited or acquired many rights of ownership or management over religious places of worship, including major hindu temples. this is fundamentally unjust. it violates secular principles doubly - first, it differentiates between some beliefs and others, in that some worshippers are free to make their own rules and others must petition the state or a quasi-state body. and second, it means that the state must busy itself with religious principles and management, which is not what a secular state should be doing. the idea behind state involvement in such religious trusts may be to protect the interests of all worshippers, but in fact, it endangers secularism itself, because the indian state is now also serving a religious function. if the temple trust in sabarimala was not headed by a kerala ruling party functionary, this would have different political implications that it does now.religious reform should indeed, of course, be a political issue - but not one that pits worshippers against the state. instead, it should be played out as disputes between worshippers of one belief and other. this is also the realm of politics - just not of the state. because the state is involved, we allow fundamentalists to believe that capturing the state is the only way to protect their religion. this is why, of course, that the bjp is happy about developments in sabarimala: it reinforces their incorrect claim that hindus are under threat unless there the secular indian state becomes a hindu rashtra.we have the right to protest and criticise the traditions of places like sabarimala. let us focus on protecting those rights. we have to tolerate religious and cultural diversity, but do not need to accept those practices we deem exclusionary. organise against sabarimala's priests and the ex-ruling family that determines its practices. protest exclusionary doctrine. but don't drag the state into a battle over religion. that opens the door to a religious state.(mihir swarup sharma is a fellow at the observer research foundation.)disclaimer: the opinions expressed within this article are the personal opinions of the author. the facts and opinions appearing in the article do not reflect the views of ndtv and ndtv does not assume any responsibility or liability for the same.",0.07965543941153698,sabarimala judgment worry freedom-loving liberals,"standards , stories emerging environs sabarimala temple extraordinary. women journalists attacked daring cover story ; priests threatening shutter temple ; kerala cops escorting women dressed riot police gear door temple ; communist party india holding press conferences discuss faith ; local congress aligning rss ; one women activists forefront agitation house kochi vandalised ; bjp openly celebrating , hoping turning point decades-long attempt gain foothold kerala politics.the principles stake seem clear. first , people barred exercising right worship basis caste gender. second , legal directive - case , supreme court judgment opening doors sabarimala women - must enforced. nobody dispute principles. support struggle women activists enter sabarimala. , believe india deserves modern country. yet , especially care individual rights , something disturbing entire process.

2018-10-29,amit shah's blatant defiance of supreme court order,"bjp president amit shah's speech in kerala using, typical of his style, the language of a school bully, should be seen as a direct assault on the supreme court of india. he said that courts should not give orders which cannot be implemented. although he was speaking on the sabarimala judgement reversing the ban on women's entry into the temple, what he said has wider implications.for example, this week the court is to hear a petition concerning the ayodhya issue. is this an ""advance"" ominous warning to the apex court: do as we want or face the consequences of your orders being flouted? following his party chief, adityanath, the uttar pradesh chief minister, has already commented that if the court can rule on sabarimala, it can also for ayodhya. the link is clear enough.in the years of the modi government with amit shah at the helm of the ruling party, this country has witnessed leaders of the ruling party and government leading the charge against the constitution of india, against the autonomy of institutions and the subverting of even constitutionally-mandated bodies to the interests of the ruling party. the shocking and shameful developments regarding the cbi and the blatant steps taken to protect not the organisation, but to subordinate it to political requirements of those in power, shows that this government is arrogant enough to believe that it can get away with all such transgressions. earlier, in an unprecedented press conference, four senior justices of the supreme court had voiced their concern about the need to protect the independence of the judiciary, precisely because of government interference. now amit shah has taken this a step further by directly threatening the court.the hypocrisy and double standards as far as respect for elected governments are concerned is equally evident. while arun jaitley makes a veiled criticism against the court intervention in the cbi matter saying that decisions of elected governments have to be respected on the principle of accountability, on the same day, his party president amit shah threatens the elected government in kerala that it will be thrown out because it is defending the supreme court judgement. in fact, the present central regime has taken steps which undermine the rights of states and elected non-bjp governments which inflict serious damage to the constitutional framework of a federal structure. amit shah's threats in kerala should be seen in that context.he likened the situation in kerala to the emergency. he was reacting to the arrests of 2,000 persons against whom the police have credible and direct evidence of being involved in the forcible prevention of women who wanted to go to the temple. amit shah himself has openly admitted that these are bjp workers. so there should be no misunderstanding that ordinary devotees are being arrested. a sample of some of the highly provocative statements made by those who amit shah defends is from the leader of the so-called ayyapa dharma sena, rahul easwar. out on bail, he announced at a press conference, ""there is provision to close the temple if there is a failure in rituals. we also need a plan b and plan c... i am saying this openly. if any one woman between the ages of 10 and 50 tried to enter the temple with the help of the police, about 20 people were ready to make a cut on their hand and shed blood. if that happens, the temple would have to be closed for three days (on account of desecration). there is no need to open it no matter who says so... if blood or urine falls on the temple, it has to be closed."" he is the grandson of the main tanthri (priest) of the temple and he declares that he is prepared to desecrate the temple with urine and blood to keep women out. these are the criminal anti- temple activities being defended by amit shah.he is mistaken if he thinks the kerala government is like the one he runs in maharashtra. in maharashtra, after the violence connected with bhima koregaon events, the ring leaders belonging to right-wing sangh parivar organisations were exonerated and hundreds of dalits were arrested using draconian laws against them. in contrast, the kerala government has identified the organised trouble makers, none of whom are ordinary devotees, and is taking action against them.since the bjp president is against the judgement of the supreme court, why does he not go to the supreme court in a review? instead, when the president of the ruling party incites violence against a court judgement and against a government led by an opposition party which upholds the court judgement, is this not the real face of authoritarianism? and these are not just words. the violence and hooliganism directly encouraged and supported by the bjp-rss saw men attacking and burning the ashram of swamy sandeepananda giri because he has differed from the bjp-rss and taken a stand in support of the sc judgement. this attack on a widely-respected swamy also exposes the reality that for the bjp-rss, it is only the rss' hindutva which is to be promoted and other men and women of the hindu faith who differ from them will be attacked.googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display(""adslotnativevideo""); });as far as the sabarimala temple is concerned, keeping women out is not ""an ancient practice"" since ""the deity is celibate"" as claimed by amit shah and the bjp. there was no blanket ban on women of fertile age going into the temple until 1991 when the kerala high court, acting on a complaint by an individual named s mahendran, gave an order that henceforth, no woman aged between 10 and 50 can go to the temple. however, the judgment itself gave examples of how women, including the then maharani of travancore in 1940 and others, had not only worshipped at the temple but participated in many temple ceremonies. the judgment said: ""there was thus no prohibition for women to enter the sabarimala temple in olden days, but women in large number were not visiting the temple. that was not because of any prohibition imposed by hindu religion but because of other non-religious factors. in recent years, many worshippers had gone to the temple with lady worshippers within the age group 10 to 50 for the first rice-feeding ceremony of their children (choroonu). the board used to issue receipts on such occasions on payment of the prescribed charges."" yet a ban was imposed.when the supreme court overturned this ban, the rss spokespersons in kerala had actually publicly welcomed it. this makes it clear that the subsequent opposition and u-turn has nothing to do with religious belief. once the rss-bjp combine saw the protests of one section of people against the judgement, it felt it could utilize this to hit several targets. the supreme court is one. the ldf government in kerala which has stood firm against the combine's attempts to inject its communal poison into the polity is another target. progressive forces across political, caste and religious lines who stand for social reform and against manuvadi ideologies are another clear target of this rss-bjp's opposition. amit shah says that women's entry into temples cannot be considered a question of equality. this is similar to the upper caste reasoning which has kept dalits out of many temples even today and which has led to violence against all those dalits seeking to worship there. the understanding against women's entry is based on the manu smriti concept of purity/impurity which holds menstruating women and untouchables equally impure.a dalit may choose to worship in a temple or not, that is an individual choice. similarly a woman believer may or may not want to go to the ayyappa temple. a woman in her menstrual cycle may choose not to visit any temple at that time. again, these are personal choices. but to prevent dalits forcibly from worshiping at a temple or to ban women from entering a temple because she is of fertile age is, as noted by the supreme court, against the fundamental rights guaranteed by the constitution.the people of kerala and indeed the people of india need to help teach constitutional values to amit shah and the party he leads.brinda karat is a politburo member of the cpi(m) and a former member of the rajya sabha.disclaimer: the opinions expressed within this article are the personal opinions of the author. the facts and opinions appearing in the article do not reflect the views of ndtv and ndtv does not assume any responsibility or liability for the same.",0.026852195423624,amit shah ' blatant defiance supreme court order,"bjp president amit shah ' speech kerala using , typical style , language school bully , seen direct assault supreme court india. said courts give orders cannot implemented. although speaking sabarimala judgement reversing ban women ' entry temple , said wider implications.for example , week court hear petition concerning ayodhya issue.
