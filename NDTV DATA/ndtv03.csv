2015-02-25,ndtv.com exclusive: the sticking points of india's $12 billion rafale fighter jet deal,"new delhi: the 12 billion dollar discussions centred on whether india will buy 126 rafale fighter jets from france have made some progress, sources said today, a day after defence minister manohar parrikar met his french counterpart jean-yves le drian in delhi.major kinks remain in need of ironing, but are unlikely to be deal-breakers, said sources involved in the talks, though they cautioned that it's unlikely that the deal will be signed before prime minister narendra modi travels to paris in april. however, by that time, some officials who are part of the negotiating process are hopeful that a statement of intent can be agreed upon by both the indian and french governments for the contract that has been stalled for nearly three years.the plan is for france to supply 18 fully-made fighter jets to india, with the other 108 being produced by the state-run hindustan aeronautica limited (hal) in bangalore. there is an option for india to acquire 63 more rafale jets.dassault aviation, the french manufacturer, has concerns about the carbon-fibre composite material that would be used by hal to form the skin of the rafale fighter. though hal prides itself in having mastered the use of these composites (which are also used on the indigenous tejas fighter plane), hal uses a manual technique. dassault, on the other hand, uses an automated and much quicker process to manufacture super-critical carbon-fibre composite structures such as the wings of the rafale. hal and dassault will now need to arrive at a consensus on how best to speedily develop carbo-composites to ensure that the time-frame for the manufacture of rafale fighters is met. a slower process by hal could mean that dassault's delivery deadlines for the rafale will not be met.french negotiators have indicated that that while they are obliged to train indian engineers on the assembly of key components of the rafale fighter, they need specific assurances to ensure that the engineers they train remain deployed and committed to the manufacture of the rafale, again, to ensure that the jets are manufactured and delivered on time to the indian air force.the rafale's primary sensor, the rbe-2 airborne electronically scanned array, is manufactured in state-of-the-art laboratories in france to exceptionally rigid production and quality standards. hal's avionics labs, which presently work on radars for the air force's sukhoi 30 have different standards and technologies in place. french sources say hal engineers will need a change in the work culture and the avionics labs in bangalore will need upgrading to meet the french standards. this is, again, not seen as a deal breaker, but the french have flagged a concern that the modernization of hal's technology could be a time-consuming process.while the ministry of defence may be aware of hal's limitations, the government is clear that these are issues that need to be negotiated between rafale and hal and that its primary concern is the eventual delivery and performance of the rafale fighter according to its advertised design specifications. ndtv has learned that the first batch of rafale fighters assembled in india would take approximately 44 months to be manufactured, though this time-frame is likely to be reduced as hal gains in experience and systems are fine-tuned. the final, fully made-in-india examples of the jet would likely be constructed quicker.hindustan aeronautics, for its part, is positive about its capabilities in manufacturing the rafale fighter. at aero india, asia's largest air show, last week, the new hal chairman suvarna raju told reporters that hal ""is the lead production agency for the medium multirole combat aircraft (ie the rafale) which gives us [the rights] for manufacture and testing. we don't want others to stand guarantee for our product."" this would be welcome news for dassault as it seeks to close the rafale deal, negotiations for which have continued for more than three years.the dassault rafale was shortlisted by the indian air force as its fighter of choice in a fly-off involving some of the world's leading fighters in 2011. for years, the air force has made it clear, that the induction of the rafale is imperative to ensure that its dwindling fleet strength is replenished with modern aircraft to counter the rapidly modernising chinese and pakistani air forces.googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display(""adslotnativevideo"");

2015-05-12,modi's expensive penchant for made-in-videsh," modi bought himself the most expensive ticket ever sold for a cruise on the river seine - a cool 5,000 million dollars to buy 36 rafale aircraft in 'fly-away' condition to get the president, prime minister, and defence minister of france, plus the mayor of paris, to beam at the cameras as he chugged up the river. no wonder they were beaming. they had just sold a lemon to the prime minister of the country that has emerged as the world's largest buyer of imported arms.of course, we need fighter aircraft. the indian air force estimates that we need 42-44 squadrons to fight a two-front war, but have only 34-35 squadrons operational at the moment, with every danger of the number of squadrons diminishing to 25 by the end of this decade. particularly in mid-range, the shortage is acute. so what the defence procurement-wallahs call a 'request for proposal', which the more illiterate of us call a 'tender', was put out some years ago for medium multi-role combat aircraft (mmrca). six bids were received. the upa government determined that the french rafale was the best because the french supplying company, dassault, offered to supply 18 rafale aircraft in 'fly-away' condition and then transfer the technology for us to 'make in india' the remaining 126. dassault baulked, however, at the suggestion that they should stand guarantee for the quality of rafale aircraft made by hindustan aeronautics ltd (hal). meanwhile, prices shot up to make the whole deal worth 20 to 30 thousand million dollars, up from the earlier estimate of about $12 billion, and, therefore, on reflection, not perhaps the cheapest of the bids.in comes modi and upsets the apple cart. without even informing his defence minister (whom he had neglected to have accompany him to paris) and without consulting the cabinet committee on security, modi, of his own sweet will, terminates years of negotiations aimed at 'make in india' to signal that he prefers fighter aircraft which are 'make in videsh'. no negotiations are held - that is left to a future date - but to get himself surrounded by a beaming french political elite, he saves a foreign company, dassault, that is teetering on the brink of bankruptcy, by unilaterally and without consulting his experts or political colleagues placing an order for $5 billion worth of aircraft.the number of aircraft being imported from france under this sweetheart deal will form approximately two squadrons, which still leaves us hugely short of the eight to ten additional squadrons that our air force chaps believe we need. worse, our brave lads in the sky have to deal with the complication of an eighth type of aircraft to our already hugely diverse and therefore unwieldy fleet. our security has not been enhanced one whit. 'make in india' has been sacrificed. and the decision has been taken without due consultation. the deal makes no sense.it also completely contradicts the approach to defence self-reliance outlined in modi's own address at the aero india show in february, just two months before he took off for france. then, he had said, ""a nation with a strong defence industry will not only be more secure, it will reap rich economic benefits. it can boost investment, expand manufacturing, support enterprise, raise the technology level and increase economic growth in the country"". that is precisely why our defence experts were negotiating a deal with dassault under which a few sample aircraft would have been manufactured in france and the rest made in india. modi sabotaged that effort in paris. why? what induced him to abandon the slogan of a lifetime - make in india - just to curry favour with his parisian hosts? is india's defence a bargaining chip to be pulled out of modi's pocket like a conjuring trick?and what of the defence offsets that were being negotiated with dassault? and that too after having declared at the air show that ""i want our offsets policy...to acquire state-of-the art technology and skills in core areas of priority"". why were the defence offsets cast aside in so cavalier a manner when the prime minister bought, of his own volition and own sweet will, two entire squadrons of rafales without getting any defence offsets - that is 'make in india' - in return?googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display(""adslotnativevideo""); });where is the investment boost? the manufacturing expansion? the support to enterprise? and raising the technology level? modi said at the air show, ""even a 20 to 25 per cent reduction in imports could directly create an additional 100,000 to 120,000 highly skilled jobs in india"". is even one job going to be created in india by buying $5 billion worth of aircraft from france? modi added, ""there would be a clear preference for equipment manufactured in india"". oh, yeah? is even one rafale screw going to be manufactured in india? modi also said, ""from sellers, foreign firms must turn into strategic partners"". how does giving up on the french firm's promise to 'make in india' turn dassault into a ""strategic partner""?and if it is a straightforward trade deal, on what basis has modi decided that he could not get an equal or even larger number of similar or superior aircraft from other manufacturers at a much lower price?

agree on sales terms, sources said, four months after prime minister narendra modi intervened to break a logjam in previous commercial negotiations.two senior defence officials told reuters that both sides were wrangling over the unit price of the aircraft and a condition that planemaker dassault aviation invest a big percentage of the value of the multi-billion dollar contract in india.the problems threaten to further delay the modernisation of india's ageing air force.military officials have warned of a major capability gap opening up with rivals china and pakistan without new western warplanes or if local defence contractors cannot build what the military needs in a timely manner.the pm and french president francois hollande announced the government-to-government deal for the sale of the off-the-shelf rafale fighters on april 10.that followed three years of commercial negotiations with dassault for 126 aircraft that stalled due to disagreements over assembling most of the aircraft in india.citing india's urgent defence needs, the prime minister chose to deal directly with paris for a smaller order, saying officials would work out the details.on may 16, defence minister manohar parrikar told local media that negotiations over pricing would be finished in a ""month or two"".but those talks were bogged down over india's insistence on a lower price for the frontline warplanes than the roughly $200 million each that was discussed with dassault during the commercial talks, said the two defence officials, who have been briefed on the new negotiations.under the previous proposal, dassault was to assemble 108 of the aircraft in india, a move new delhi hoped would help boost a high-tech local aerospace industry. there is no production in india in the new arrangement.""since there is no technology transfer, the price that was on the table during the commercial talks cannot stand,"" said one of the officials, who declined to be identified because he was not authorised to speak to the media.the defence ministry said negotiators were in talks to produce a draft agreement, but declined to give details.a dassault spokesman declined to comment, as did the french defence procurement agency.the two defence officials said another sticking point is delhi's standard requirement that arms makers invest a percentage of the value of any deal above $50 million in india.in this instance, india wants dassault to invest at least 30 percent of the contract value locally through activities such as the sourcing of components for future french operations, the setting up of manufacturing facilities in india or by providing high-tech job training, the officials said.""this issue has become bigger than the procurement,"" said amit cowshish, a former financial advisor on arms purchases to the indian defence ministry, who has been tracking the negotiations.complicating matters, the indian air force (iaf) has reportedly asked for technical modifications so the latest weapons could be fitted to the jets.the air force declined to comment, saying the deal was in the government's hands.a domestic programme to build a light combat aircraft to form the backbone of the air force is 19 years behind schedule, with the first plane due for final operational clearance in march 2016.meanwhile, nearly 260 mig 21 and mig 27 cold war-era fighter jets are due

that is, if the rafale is operationally not available at least 90 per cent of the time that it is required to fly a sortie. this is a key concern for the indian air force since its frontline russian-designed sukhoi 30 mki jet has an abysmal availability rate of under 60 per cent, which means the air force doesn't have enough sukhois operational when it needs them. india has also still not finalized the total number and exact type of weapon systems that would come with the rafale - a key component of the overall cost of the package. president hollande arrives will be in india from january 25 to 27 (he lands in chandigarh and will be the chief guest at the republic day parade).new rules in india state that defence deals over 300 crores must be accompanied by investing 30 per cent of the value of the contract in manufacturing in india. france has reportedly agreed in principle to that stipulation ""in the future"", a move that has helped both sides side-step this potentially contentious requirement for the moment. indian military officials have warned their air force risks a major capability gap with china and pakistan without new western warplanes, or if local defence contractors cannot produce what the military needs in a timely manner. in october, the government turned down the military's request to expand the acquisition of 36 dassault-built fighter planes to plug vital gaps, nudging it to accept an indigenous combat plane. cockpit of the dassault rafale fighterit could take more than a year for india to actually start acquiring the rafale jets once the contract is signed since manufacturer dassault is already constructing the state-of-the-art fighter for the french air force and egypt and qatar which have recently signed contracts to acquire the planes. however, france has reportedly offered to help india, a strategic partner, acquire the jets as early as possible though it is unclear whether that would mean the french air force deferring acquisition of its own rafale fighters or, alternately, loaning india a handful of fighters it already has in service till dassault is ready to deliver the rafales ordered by delhi.",0.04648869648869649,india ' deal 36 rafale fighter jets still negotiated,"new delhi : days go french president francois hollande arrives india , crucial deal delhi buy 36 french-built rafale warplanes yet decided.speaking reuters today , french defence minister jean-yves le drian said deal remains evasive , underscoring considerable differences negotiators sides , nearly nine months prime minister narendra modi visited paris announced plans buy fighter jets directly french government following collapse larger commercial deal dassault aviation.ndtv learned all-in price likely range 65,000 crores nearly $ 10 billion , includes cost 36 fighter jets fly-away condition , weapon systems , support maintenance package. india still needs decide whether immediately fund large order spare parts aircraft need period either five ten years. sides also talks financial penalties french manufacturer jet would incur unsatisfactory performance -

2016-06-27,no nsg membership and 6 nuclear reactors - modi's bad deal," wherever modi goes in the world, the razzmatazz is bought at enormous cost to the country and in surrender of our larger national interests. one example was the cruise on the seine he got with france's high and mighty in april 2015 as a result of his compromise on buying rafale fighter aircraft, detailed earlier in this column.the latest is his abuse of executive authority in agreeing with obama in washington, of his own sweet will, without consulting experts and without the concurrence of his cabinet, to splurge over rs 4,00,000 crore ($21 billion) on six ap1000 westinghouse nuclear reactors. there was no tender. there was no open bidding. worse, westinghouse were assured they would be indemnified in the event of a nuclear accident under an international legal commitment, the convention on supplementary compensation (csc). india acceded to csc in february 2016, even as preparations were on for modi's nth trip to washington, notwithstanding the obvious contradictions between the csc and india's own domestic legislation, the limited liability act passed on dr. manmohan singh's watch during the upa-ii government.this apparently was in exchange for obama reiterating his support for india's bid to secure entry to the nuclear suppliers' group (nsg). and this, of course, amounted to knocking at the wrong door for the us had long committed itself to supporting india without assuring us - as george w. bush had assured manmohan - that the us would pull out all diplomatic and not-so-diplomatic stops to get us nsg membership as they had the ""one-time waiver"". this was essentially because there is no commercial gain for the us from india's nsg membership, while the ""waiver"" opened the way to the us to sell nuclear power reactors built by their moribund nuclear power industry, the source of campaign funding for bush, to the world's most lucrative market - india - at a time when most western countries and japan are shutting down their plans and plants for nuclear power in the wake of fukushima and the earlier accidents at three mile island and chernobyl, not to mention dozens of smaller accidents that are quietly hushed up. us president barack obama meets with pm narendra modi in the oval office of the white house in washington on june 7, 2016 (pti photo)the right door for modi to knock at was, of course, president xi jinping's - quietly, unobtrusively, as a gesture of friendship and cooperation in the spirit of panchsheel. instead, modi's visit to washington, where he proclaimed his ""historic"" alliance with the united states at just the juncture where the us is trying to draw us ever closer into the net it is throwing around china, immediately preceded modi's dash to tashkent to fall at xi's feet to beg chinese support. little wonder, modi was spurned. in consequence, we are saddled with six westinghouse reactors but no membership of nsg. how's that for a double whammy?there are several major unresolved issues arising out of the obama-modi joint statement issued in washington that ""welcomed the start of preparatory work"" on putting up these six reactors in india. the first is that westinghouse is only nominally an american company. it was bought by japan's toshiba in 2006 and japan's ihi is also invested in westinghouse. moreover, it is only japanese companies like japan steel works that have the capacity to make the large forgings that must go into the construction of westinghouse reactors. all this requires, besides obama's go-ahead, the consent of the japanese government, the japanese parliament and japanese public opinion. and all three are deeply suspicious of an india that refuses to sign the nuclear non-proliferation treaty (npt), is armed with nuclear weapons and is in confrontation with two other nuclear-armed states, china and pakistan.which is why shinzo abe, despite being the most pro-indian and most hawkish pm japan has had since world war ii, could no more than ""agree to agree"" when he visited india last december. no agreement could be signed till the ""technical details"" were sorted out - and these technical details include all the points of ideological disputation mentioned above. in short, the december joint statement amounted to confessing that there is an agreement to agree but until an agreement is reached, the lack of agreement would keep disagreement simmering! in such circumstances, would toshiba, the owner of westinghouse, really move forward? please also note that the japanese angle would continue to be a stumbling block even when - and if - we get to ge's reactors or areva's, for the former has heavy japanese investment and the latter needs both japanese technology and large-scale engineering facilities available only in japan. frankly, modi is stuck even if he won't admit it. prime minister narendra modi met chinese president xi jinping at the sco summit in tashkent last weekand perhaps that's just as well because toshiba have reported that after acquiring westinghouse, their net operating losses have risen to nearly $300 million. they have, therefore, offered a ""write-down"" of $2.3 billion on their westinghouse asset. what the japanese correspondent, kana inagaki, has recently described in the financial times of london as ""persistent concerns about the economic viability of westinghouse's ap 1000 design"" have, in the immediate past, led to the postponement ""by at least four years"" of two of the westinghouse reactors ordered by a florida utility and the cancellation of two others by the intending buyer, the tennessee valley authority who have called this ""fiscally responsible action"". why are we in the market for such a lemon?extrapolating from the capital costs of the two westinghouse reactors actually being built in the state of georgia in the united states, two india scientists, suvrat raju of bengaluru and m.v. ramana of princeton, have calculated that whereas westinghouse's capital costs translate into rs 70 crore per megawatt, indigenous indian reactors are installed at rs 10 crore per megawatt, that is, ""seven times lower"" than westinghouse. such dauntingly high capital costs, they argue, would render westinghouse's first year tariffs at rs 25 per unit of electricity as against rs 4 from coal and rs 5 for solar power. how can we possibly afford the ap 1000s that modi has so blithely committed himself to buying if westinghouse chooses to enter india? has he completely forgotten enron leading us up a similar garden path - from which we were saved only because enron executives, including those operating in india, were jailed in the us for fraud and extortion?bending backwards to accommodate us concerns cannot be the way forward. we have to go in for well-tested designs that are economical and with proven safety records. the three western firms in the running are so uncertain of their safety features that even with a cap of just $250 million on their liability in the event of a nuclear accident they are shying away from selling to india for fear of what they might bring upon themselves. union carbide, with its 15,000 deaths, is a ghost that cannot be wished away, especially when minimally 1,50,000 india citizens will die if anything goes wrong with nuclear power plants. that is the danger the modi government is keeping under wraps as it desperately tries to woo the us and bail out its dying nuclear power industry. let none of us forget that the clean-up at fukushima is costing the japanese taxpayer at least $200 billion. as the nsg waiver enables us to purchase the tiny amount of uranium we need for electricity generation, and india's heavy water reactors do not need enriched uranium for civil use, and light water reactors come with associated fuel contracts, why are we bankrupting ourselves and putting our people in mortal danger so that modi can dine at the nuclear high table?

2018-01-26,the mysterious math of team modi's rafale deal," there used to be a song in my youth that went ""you can run, but you can't hide"". raksha mantri nirmala sitharaman might be well advised to keep that line humming in her mind as parliament convenes for its budget session next week - when she will be held accountable for the steep price she has paid for a handful of rafale jet fighters.at her november press conference, smt sitharaman stated, according to the indian express, that ""the amount paid for each french fighter aircraft by the current government was much lower than the one negotiated by the upa government during its tenure"" (emphasis added).the indian express report goes on to say, ""she was repeatedly asked by the journalists to share the comparative aircraft costs for the two governments"". she is said to have responded, ""i am not shying away from giving figures"" and added that she was ""asking the defence secretary to share the numbers"".fairly straightforward, one would say. the minister claims she is ""not shying away"" from the price issue and instructs the civil servant who heads her ministry to go ahead and ""share the numbers"". then why, two months later, has the comparative costs chart not been placed in the public domain?moreover, defence analyst ajai shukla has permitted me to say that he has specifically asked the director of public relations in the ministry for this promised information but the official has not (at the time of writing) deigned to reply. so what are they hiding? why are they so furtive? why, if i might borrow the lady's elegant phrase, are they ""shying away""?well, they can't run beyond the forthcoming parliament session because the opposition is bound to remind her of her published assurance and ask her to furnish the information she has publicly pledged to provide the nation. at that time, she will have to come clean. she will be asked to show how the price she has negotiated is ""much lower"" than the earlier deal either in terms of the price per aircraft or the overall deal. as and when the figures are revealed, she will be revealed as having been somewhat economical with the truth.for the official congress spokesman made it known on november 17 that the price per aircraft settled by the upa was rs. 526.1 crore - whereas the modi government's negotiated price was rs. 1570.8 crore per aircraft.not even the mathematical genius of srinivasa ramanujam would be able to show 1570 as less than 526! and if you don't like a comparison in indian rupees for a foreign purchase, let us recall that the spokesman had said the same thing in us dollars. upa settled the dollar price at $80.95 million per aircraft. the modi government are paying out $241.66 million for each rafale. by what sleight of hand or arithmetical legerdemain can 241 be ""much lower"" than 80?when it comes to a comparison of the total costs, the upa commitment was around rs 54,000 crore. the modi government will be shelling out rs. 58,000 crore. by what logic is 58 ""much lower"" than 54?googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display(""adslotnativevideo""); });secondly, the upa was going to pay rs 54,000 crore for 126 aircraft; the modi government is paying out rs 4,000 crore more than that for a mere 36 aircraft. how can this make for a ""far better deal per aircraft"" as madam sitharaman claimed at her press conference?what is sadder still is that there is no ""make in india"" involved in the new bjp deal. all 36 rafale fighter jets are being procured in mint ""fly away"" condition. under the upa, we were buying 18 rafale aircraft in ""fly-away"" condition and getting the remaining 108 aircraft assembled in india with a considerable measure of indigenous manufacture. even more significantly, the deal involved the transfer of technology so that we could ourselves manufacture as many more fighter jets, and for as long as we wished, without having to go beyond our shores. given that the india air force has long pitched its demand for such jet fighters at around an additional 250 aircraft, the technical capacity to manufacture more than a hundred aircraft over and above what the french were selling us would have made us virtually self-sufficient in medium multirole combat aircraft. now, we can make nothing more than the 36 we have bought. no transfer of technology. no ""make in india"". how can this possibly be a ""far better deal""?ah, reply the mandarins of the defence ministry, you have to take account of all the special features of the aircraft we have purchased, its several ""india-specific"" modifications and accessories. but at what cost per aircraft are we getting these additional features? that would have become obvious if smt sitharaman had not shied away, or if her officers had carried out instructions publicly given in the presence of a legion of defence correspondents called together by the minister herself. it is understood that some of the more fancy special features are not being manufactured by the french company, dassault, at all. they are procuring these items from israel and others sources. as some or many of these accessories are not integral to the basic aircraft but ""add-ons"", would it not have been more economical to separately acquire them from the original manufacturers? would the ""comparative chart"" not reveal how much in terms of price has been added on and how it compares with direct procurement?there is also the curious angle to excluding the public sector hindustan aircraft ltd (hal) from the deal. there is, after all, only one company in india that has actually manufactured military aircraft. hal-made aircraft have been inducted into the indian air force. it was hal that was to be entrusted by the upa deal with the transferred technology and the assembly/manufacturing mandate. why suddenly shift to the private sector? i am not per se against private sector manufacture of defence equipment, but would have been more comfortable entrusting a vital component of national defence security to an established manufacturer than to a relatively new hand. of course, the raksha mantri can explain why the involvement of hal in the rafale transaction was suddenly terminated. but that might drag her into rough waters. for, associated with that would be the question tweeted by congress president rahul gandhi: ""can you explain 'reliance' on someone with nil experience in aerospace for the rafale deal?"" anil ambani's group has, of course, answered the question to their own satisfaction. but the question was not posed to reliance. it was posed to the minister charged with the defence of india. it is for her to answer. and if she does not do so suo moto on the floor of the house, the opposition, one expects, will oblige her to answer. truthfully.what needs to be explained is the urgency behind making an emergency deal when the previous government had already negotiated a cheaper, better, more comprehensive deal that would have given us many more jet fighters to fill yawning gap in our defence preparedness and, eventually, through the 'make in india' route, all the medium multirole combat aircraft the air force is asking for. instead, the country is being treated to the spectacle of a raksha mantri, of all mantris, ""shying"" away from taking this country into confidence. not much longer though.

2018-02-09,what is rafale deal controversy? all you need to know,"new delhi: in april 2015, prime minister narendra modi had announced that india will buy 36 french-manufactured rafale fighter jets off-the-shelf from dassault, the french aircraft builder and integrator. the rafale was chosen in 2012 over rival offers from the united states, europe and russia. the step was needed to upgrade india's ageing fleet. the original plan was that india would buy 18 off-the-shelf jets from france's dassault aviation, with 108 others being assembled in india by the state-run hindustan aeronautics limited or hal in bengaluru.the modi-led bjp government, however, rowed back from the commitment of the last upa government to buy 126 rafales, saying the twin-engined planes would be too expensive and the deal fell through after nearly decade-long negotiations between india and france. there were a lot of hiccups over costs of the aircraft. however, faced with the dipping number of fighters and a pressing need to upgrade the indian air force, prime minister narendra modi intervened and decided to buy 36 ""ready-to-fly"" fighters instead of trying to acquire technology from dassault and make it in india.soon after the deal was declared, the congress accused the ruling bjp of non-transparency in the multi-billion dollar deal and called it ""one of the biggest failures"" of the 'make-in-india' programme.in january 2016, india confirmed order of 36 rafale jets in defence deal with france and under this deal, dassault and its main partners - engine-maker safran and electronic systems-maker thales - will share some technology with drdo (defence research and development organisation) and some private sector companies and hal under the offsets clause.the twin-engine rafale combat jet is designed from the beginning as a multi-role fighter for air-to-air and air-to-ground attack is nuclear-capable and its on-board electronic warfare (ew) systems can also perform reconnaissance and radar jamming roles.rafale deal: prime minister narendra modi with french president francois hollande during an official dinner in paris. photo credit: afpnearly one- and-half years after prime minister narendra modi announced the proposal during a visit to paris, finally in september 2016, india signed an inter-governmental agreement with france, dubbed as ""rafale deal"", in which india will pay about rs 58,000 crore or 7.8 billion euros for 36 off-the-shelf dassault rafale twin-engine fighters. about 15 per cent of this cost is being paid in advance. as per the deal, india will also get spares and weaponry, including the meteor missile, considered among the most advanced in the world.googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display(""adslotnativevideo"");

2018-02-27,'laissez faire not ok': minister suggests key changes to fix weapons-buying process,"new delhi: highlightsdr subhash bhambre calls for change in attitude to being time-conscious dr bhamre's report says request for proposal stage sees repeated delays centre follows nine stages before a major defence deal is signedwindow._pricee = window._pricee || []; _pricee.push({container : '_pcwgtmid'}); confronted by a system of arms procurement that lies in tatters, dr subhash bhambre, the minister of state for defence, has recommended a series of reforms at each of the nine stages prior to a defence deal being announced. he suggests a change in attitude from laissez-faire to being time-conscious and says ""due diligence"" cannot be an excuse for mammoth delays.yesterday, ndtv broke details of why dr bhamre felt his ministry was replete with ""multiple and diffused structures with no single-point accountability, multiple decision heads, duplication of processes - avoidable redundant layers doing the same thing over and over again, delayed comments, delayed decisions, delayed execution, no real-time monitoring, no programme/project based approach [and a] tendency to fault-find rather than to facilitate."" as a result of this mess, of the 144 schemes contracted during the last three financial years, ""only 8%-10% fructified within the stipulated time period.""there are nine stages that the government follows before a major defence deal is signed, a process that, in the case of a major acquisition, can easily take more than a decade to be cleared. this means india's armed forces are poorly equipped and frequently have to rely on obsolete weapons systems as they prepare to fight modern wars. the best example of this laboriously slow process is the indian air force's demand for 126 modern fighter jets, first raised in 2001. seventeen years later, all that has been contracted for are 36 french rafale fighters, not a single one of which has been delivered so far.in a 27-point internal report in november last, dr bhamre has pointed out that the request for proposal (rfp) stage in the defence ministry sees repeated delays during the early stages of the deal process. ""the average time taken by a scheme at this stage is 120 weeks,"" six times more than the 20 weeks permitted by the defence procurement procedure 2016, the government's manual on how defence acquisitions have to be managed. this is because of ""repeated queries, lesser stress on collegiate meetings, delays in submitting comments/observations, delay in vendor assessment [and] duplication of process,"" it says.now, after a file has been cleared by a collegiate within the system, ""there should be no follow up of issues of rfp."" what's more, the defence ministry collegiate should not meet more than twice to vet the process. india is notorious for having one of the world's most complicated systems to acquire weaponry.there are several problems which have been identified when a weapon system that is being evaluated enters the trial evaluation state. the average time to complete this ""is 89 weeks, which is three times more than that authorised."" this is often because field formations which conduct trials ""are not adequately equipped or conversant with the trial methodology."" in simple terms, officers of the air force, army and navy may not be experienced enough to deal with the complex assessment process through which a weapon system is graded on multiple parameters before being deemed fit or unfit for use by india's armed forces.dr bhamre suggests that a trial overseeing team speed up this process while the defence ministry also explores setting up ""well equipped laboratories/test facilities with the necessary international accreditations in specific defence related areas/zones.""cost negotiating, which ""forms the backbone of a successful contract"" is another area where delays are the norm. ""the average time taken was 60 weeks,"" says dr bhamre, ""about 10 times more than that allowed."" in one case, cost negotiations with a foreign equipment manufacturer was delayed by ""a colossal 273 weeks.""to improve the system here means that that the process to benchmark costs vis-a-vis international standards has to be fine-tuned. to do this, officers in the defence ministry need to be educated. india, the minister says, needs ""a pool of domain experts trained in negotiating skills, as well as contractual experts."" in nations such as the united states, dr bhamre explains, ""the defence acquisition university has an entire course dedicated to cost methodology, where they teach over 18 ways of pricing/benchmarking.""googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display(""adslotnativevideo""); });if a file on the purchase of a weapons system actually clears all the hurdles in the defence ministry, it is still far from seeing the light of day because the finance ministry, which is the chief financial authority (cfa), is presently ""not aware of the services capital acquisition plans or the annual acquisition plan being prepared by the ministry of defence."" india has revived the deal to buy spike anti-tank missiles from israel just weeks after new delhi had exited the $500 million deal.in other words, the defence ministry all along seems to be working in isolation towards clearing a deal only to be confronted by bureaucrats in the finance ministry, who end up asking numerous questions late in the deal process, ""a few of them being even of basic nature."" to stop this, dr bhamre suggests ""we should consider further devolution of financial powers to the ministry of defence"" so that decisions can be taken within the ministry. at the moment, the defence minister is empowered to clear deals worth rs 2,000 crore, the defence secretary is authorised to clear rs 300 crore and the armed forces can clear projects worth rs 150 crore without the file needing to move to the finance ministry.india is notorious for having one of the world's most complicated systems to acquire weaponry.the process begins when the army, navy, air force or coast guard identify their needs. this is followed by a right for information (rfi), when the forces can ask defence manufacturers for details of some of their productions. on the basis of what they receive, a service defines its qualitative requirements. this is then forwarded to the defence ministry, which either rejects the demand made by the armed forces or issues an acceptance of necessity (aon) that kick-starts the formal process of initiating a defence deal.based on an initial shortlist made at the aon stage, the defence ministry reaches out to arms manufacturers which it asks for a request for proposal (rfp), where interested parties formally respond to the defence ministry's invitation. based on the responses, the defence ministry, in conjuction with the armed forces, form a technical evaluation committee (tec) that examines the capabilities and technical features of weapons systems being assessed for potential purchase. those systems that meet are shortlisted and sent for field evaluation trials (fet) where they are rigorously tested. the government then forms a cost negotiating committee (cnc) that receives financial bids from the competing firms selected and picks the lowest common bidder.the lowest common bidder has technically ""won"" the competition though in the case of india, there is absolutely no guarantee of that translating into a contract unless there is a final go ahead by the chief financial authority (cfa).in december, ndtv emailed a set of questions on the report on defence procurement to the defence ministry's spokesperson, who acknowledged them but offered no answers. separate reminders through phone messages were also acknowledged but, again, no answers were provided.

2018-08-29,decoding rafale deal: from allegations to counter-allegations,"as the controversy surrounding rafale deal escalates, here is an explainer and a timeline relating to india's purchase of 36 combat jets from france for an estimated rs 58,000 crore:what is rafale?rafale is a french twin-engine multi-role fighter jet designed and built by dassault aviation. the rafale jets are considered one of the most potent combat jets globally.what was the upa deal?india began the process to buy a fleet of 126 medium multi-role combat aircraft (mmrca) in 2007 after the defence ministry, headed then by congress leader a k antony, cleared the proposal from the indian air force.the contenders for the mega deal were lockheed martin's f-16s, eurofighter typhoon, russia's mig-35, sweden's gripen, boeing's f/a-18s and dassault aviation's rafale.after a long-drawn process, bids were opened in december 2012 and dassault aviation emerged as l-1 (lowest bidder). in the original proposal, 18 planes were to be manufactured in france and 108 in india in collaboration with the hindustan aeronautics ltd.there were lengthy negotiations between the then upa government and dassault on prices and transfer of technology. the final negotiations continued till early 2014 but the deal could not go through.details of the negotiatied price per rafale were not officially announced, but it was suggested by the then upa government that the size of the deal would be usd 10.2 billion.the congress claimed per aircraft rate including avionics and weapons was zeroed in at rs 526 crore (as per euro exchange rates prevailing then).what was the deal finalised by modi government?during his visit to france, prime minister narendra modi on april 10 announced india will purchase 36 rafale jets in a government-to-government agreement. after the announcement, questions were raised by the opposition on how the pm finalised the deal without approval of the cabinet committee on security.a joint statement issued on april 10, 2015, after talks between modi and then french president francois hollande, said they agreed to conclude an inter-governmental agreement for supply of 36 rafale jets on terms that would be better than conveyed by dassault aviation as part of a separate process underway.googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display(""adslotnativevideo""); });the statement said the ""aircraft and associated systems and weapons would be delivered on the same configuration as had been tested and approved by indian air force, in clear reference to negotiations and testing process for the rafale jets under the upa government.the final deal?india and france signed an euro 7.87-billion (rs 59,000 crore approximately) deal on september 23, 2016 for 36 rafale jets. the delivery of the aircraft will start from september 2019. the deal was finalised on the basis of the procurement procedure followed under the upa government.the allegations?the congress has been accusing massive irregularities in the deal, alleging that the government was procuring each aircraft at a cost of over rs 1,670 crore as against rs 526 crore finalised by the upa government. the party has also demanded answers from the government on why state-run aerospace major hal was not involved in the deal.the congress has also sought to know price details of the aircraft and how the rate per aircraft has gone up from rs 526 crore to rs 1,670 crore. the government has refused to share the details, citing a secrecy clause of a 2008 pact between india and france. congress' a k antony, who was defence minister in 2008 when india and france inked an inter-governmental agreement on defence procurement, said the government's claim that the secrecy clause was forcing it to not reveal price details of the deal was ""totally wrong"". the party claimed that qatar had purchased 12 rafale fighter jets in november 2017 for usd 108.33 million per aircraft (rs 694.80 crore).the congress has also alleged the government was benefitting the reliance defence ltd (rdl) through the deal as the company has set up a joint venture with dassault aviation to execute the offset obligation for the rs 59,000 crore deal.the has party alleged reliance defence was formed just 12 days before the announcement of the rafale deal by the prime minister on april 10, 2015. the rdl has rejected all the charges.under india's offset policy, foreign defence entities are mandated to spend at least 30 per cent of the total contract value in india through procurement of components or setting up of research and development facilities.on october 3, 2016, rdl and dassault aviation announced a joint venture (jv) in the aerospace sector and a year later, foundation stone of a manufacturing facility was laid in mihan, nagpur. the government's response?around two years back, minister of state for defence, while replying to a question in parliament, had said the cost of each rafale aircraft is approximately rs 670 crore but did not give details of prices of associated equipment, weapons and services.later, the government refused to talk about the prices. it has been maintaining that the cost of 36 rafale jets cannot be ""directly compared"" with the original proposal to buy 126 combat aircraft as ""deliverables"" were significantly different. finance minister arun jaitley wrote a facebook post today, accusing congress and its leader rahul gandhi of ""peddling untruth"" and carrying out a ""false campaign"" on the deal. he said the deal signed by the nda government was on better terms than the one agreed to in 2007 under the upa regime.(this story has not been edited by ndtv staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)",0.028124999999999997,decoding rafale deal : allegations

2018-09-13,why air force officials are being forced to defend rafale deal,"last week, three french air force rafale jet fighters landed at the air force station in gwalior with a view to conducting joint operations with their iaf counterparts. the french contingent was in transit after having participated in the multi-nation combat exercise named pitch black held in australia in which iaf sukhois had also participated. on this occasion, the french embassy lauded the depth of the indo-french strategic partnership and the trust that prevails in the relations between the respective armed forces.neither the french embassy nor their contingent in gwalior would have been unaware of the political slugfest that has embroiled the name of the rafale fighter and silently wondered whether their hosts actually understood the vital strategic potential of the proposed rafale weapon system in the shadow of a nuclear threat environment.the french would not have been the only ones to be so confused. we also had the first 2+2 dialogue being held between the indian foreign and defence ministers and their respective us counterparts where the future direction of the evolving strategic partnership would be under discussion. at that session, it would be the us government teams, conscious of the rafale controversy, who would wonder whether some of the past procurements through government-to-government programmes with the us like the c17 heavy-lift transport aircraft, c 130 hercules, p 81 maritime reccee aircraft, chinook heavy-lift helicopters and others, along with their offset obligations, could fall prey to a similar controversy, thus harming their reputation.clearly, the ominous cloud of daily political recrimination must have cast a deep shadow not only over the skies of gwalior, but across iaf crew rooms and messes, deeply undermining the confidence and morale of the force. this would perhaps explain why the iaf leadership was compelled to take the unprecedented step of making public statements, indirectly jumping into what is essentially a political fray. the vcas or vice chief of the air staff responsible for operations, when questioned, termed the rafale a 'very capable aircraft that will give india unprecedented advantage over its adversaries, a capability that was needed very quickly'.the dcas or deputy chief of air staff, who as head of plans and procurement would have intimately been involved in the entire process, went a step further and countering allegations of any wrongdoing said ""what is being alleged does not match with facts at all."" on the question of higher costs, he clarified, ""i can tell you that the rafale that we have gone for is substantially lower than the price that was on the table in 2008."" and finally, on allegations that the offset contract had been awarded to certain private players, he said, ""the facts on record indicate that there is no truth in those allegations.""it needs recalling that similar sentiments were expressed by the chief of the air staff late last year and repeated in adampur in july. clearly, the iaf leadership appears concerned that this public slugfest is having an adverse impact not just on the morale of the force, but their confidence in the professional integrity of its leadership as well.unknown to those who hold forth daily in tv studios and the media and more importantly, their minders, what should have been a giant strategic step forward in the modernising and strengthening of indian air power is turning out to be unsettling and self-defeating. if combat pilots across our northern and western frontiers are chuckling, we have only our politics to blame.googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display(""adslotnativevideo""); });as if to remind the nation of the dire straits that the iaf finds itself in, flying obsolete platforms amidst a declining combat force level, the iaf has these last three months lost two mig-27s, one mig-21 and one jaguar aircraft with the sad loss of two lives. a cruel reminder of the shape of things to come. unmindful, the sterile debate rages on, demonstrating that political one-upmanship means far more to our democracy than the operational capability and safety of our armed forces.ironically, even as the government is being accused of favouring a private offset partner, tata advanced systems and lockheed martin corp have announced an agreement whereby tasl will manufacture in hyderabad wings for all future lockheed f-16 customers. this should have been a matter of jubilation for our make-in-india efforts. instead, since lockheed are also amongst the potential bidders for a new iaf tender, they have been defensive and declared that this agreement is not contingent on the success or otherwise of that bid!

2018-09-24,why we chose anil ambani's firm despite massive debt: dassault sources,"new delhi: dassault, one of the world's most established and experienced defence manufacturers, picked anil ambani's debt-ridden firm as a partner in india, ""because it was registered with the mca (ministry of corporate affairs) and had land in nagpur which provided access to the runway,"" said top sources at the french firm, speaking to ndtv on the condition of anonymity.as justification, those reasons are unlikely to tamp down the opposition's allegations that mr ambani benefited from brazen crony capitalism in a massive $8.6 billion deal for india's purchase of 36 rafale fighter jets from france, a deal that was negotiated personally and then announced by prime minister narendra modi in 2016 during a visit to paris.for months, the opposition congress has alleged wrongdoing in the rafale deal; it claims pm modi overpaid for the planes and struck the deal without any transparency; the government has hit back, accusing the congress of making wild allegations without any evidence and pointing out that the rafale deal, though with vastly different contours, originated when the congress was in power.last week, the opposition received a huge shot in the arm with former french president francois hollande, who negotiated the rafale deal with pm modi, declaring that it was the indian government who proposed reliance -- ""we had no choice"", he said. but a day later, he said that it was for dassault to comment on whether it had been pressured to choose mr ambani's firm as an offset partner -- as part of the contract, dassault has to invest 50 per cent of the overall value of the deal or rs 30,000 crore in partnering with defence manufacturers in india.dassault aviation's rafale is an advanced all-weather multirole fighter jetdassault has emphatically said it was not influenced to pick anil ambani; but on monday, speaking to ndtv, sources at the defence manufacturer said that they began engaging with anil ambani after the defence manufacturing company ""changed hands"" from his older brother, mukesh, to him and that the plans for the joint venture were firmed up at aero india, the massive air show held in bengaluru in 2015, just 2 months before the rafale deal was announced by pm modi in paris.the plans to buy rafales for the air force were first set upon by the government of dr manmohan singh; originally, hal, the state-run company, was to play a large role in the manufacturing of 108 planes; mukesh ambani's defence firm was to be a partner contributing to the process but its intended role was not clear. dassault has maintained that it began talks with mukesh ambani's firm in 2012, then changed later to discussions with the company headed by his brother.that's because mukesh ambani, the country's richest man, exited the rafale landscape over the complicated and lengthy procurement rules that accompany defence deals; his defence unit was then taken over by anil ambani, whose own business empire was bleeding profusely.just 17 days before prime minister narendra modi announced that india would buy 36 rafale fighter jets from france off-the-shelf, the top boss at dassault, which is the parent company of rafale, made a speech where he said that the company was looking forward to a partnership with hal, the state-run defence manufacturer.a big part of dassault's commitment to investing in india is met through a joint venture with anil ambani's reliance defence in nagpur which will manufacture parts for some dassault jets.""the statement by dassault chairman on the impending deal with hal was because dassault was hopeful of the (126 aircraft) deal and did not know what was happening inside the ministry of defence,"" a dassault source told ndtv on monday.googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display(""adslotnativevideo""); });the video of the dassault chief, eric trappier, professing this, was shared on social media on monday by the opposition congress to bolster its claims that pm modi cut out hal to favour anil ambani, whose rookie defence manufacturing company benefitted greatly from the new deal. a big part of dassault's commitment to investing in india is met through a joint venture with anil ambani's firm in nagpur which will manufacture parts for some dassault jets; none of these will be used in the rafales that india has bought from france.those who defend the new rafale deal say that hal priced itself out of the deal because the number of hours and people it needed to build the planes was far larger than what dassault was offering in france. the government also says that it was during the congress's time that hal became an unviable proposition, so the congress is wrongly accusing pm modi's administration of wronging a public sector company.hal, sources in favour of the deal say, never had any interest in serving as an offset partner -- instead it wanted to build the main structure of the fighter jets here.the government has separately alleged that former french president hollande's allegations have been made to save his own skin -- he's accused of conflict of interest because an entertainment company owned by anil ambani co-produced a film by the french leader's partner right when the crucial rafale deal was finalised.a french minister on monday said mr hollande's allegations could hurt ties with india -- but he did not counter them as untrue.",0.08027146464646462,chose anil ambani ' firm despite massive debt : dassault sources,"new delhi : dassault , one world ' established experienced defence manufacturers , picked anil ambani ' debt-ridden firm partner india , "" registered mca ( ministry corporate affairs ) land nagpur provided access runway , "" said top sources french firm , speaking ndtv condition anonymity.as justification , reasons unlikely tamp opposition ' allegations mr ambani benefited brazen crony capitalism massive $ 8.6 billion deal india ' purchase 36 rafale fighter jets france , deal negotiated personally announced prime minister narendra modi 2016 visit paris.for months , opposition congress alleged wrongdoing rafale deal ;

2018-09-27,6 questions for team modi on rafale deal - by yashwant sinha,"the revelation by hollande, the former president of france, that anil ambani's firm reliance defence was chosen as the indian offset partner by the french company dassault at the instance of the indian government, has added another twist to the sordid tale of the rafale deal. the brief history of this long saga is that in 2007, the upa government accepted the proposal of the indian air force to buy 126 fighter aircraft to fix its depleting strength. the proposal then went through the long rigmarole of the prescribed procedure for defence purchases. finally, rafale was selected as the most suitable supplier. the understanding with dassault was that they would supply 18 planes in a 'fly-away condition' and the remaining 108 planes would be made in india by hal for which dassault would transfer technology. though the negotiations reached an advanced stage, the upa government could not clinch the deal.within a year of assuming office, prime minister modi decided to visit france in april 2015. the rafale deal was ready to be clinched. eric trappier, the ceo of dassault, had said on march 25, 2015, ""you can imagine my satisfaction to hear from the hal chairman that we are in agreement for the responsibility sharing, considering as well our conformity with the rfp (request for proposal) in order to be in line with the rules of this competition. i strongly believe that contract finalisation and signature would come soon"".prime minister narendra modi with former french president francois hollande (file)on april 8, 2015, then foreign secretary s jaishankar while briefing journalists about the prime minister's visit, had this to say on the rafale deal: ""in terms of rafale, my understanding is that there are discussions underway between the french company, our ministry of defence, the hal, which is involved in this. these are very technical, detailed discussions. we do not mix up leadership level visits with deep details of ongoing defence contracts. this is on a different track. a leadership visit usually looks at big picture issues even in the security field.""this was the status of the deal when prime minister modi arrived in france. after the scheduled summit-level talks between him and the then president of france, francois hollande, a joint statement was issued on april 10, 2015, two days after the foreign secretary's press briefing and 15 days after the statement of eric trappier. the joint statement said, ""the two leaders agreed to conclude an inter-governmental agreement for supply of the aircraft on terms that would be better than conveyed by dassault aviation as part of a separate process underway; the delivery would be in time-frame that would be compatible with the operational requirement of iaf; and that the aircraft and associated systems and weapons would be delivered on the same configuration as had been tested and approved by indian air force, and with a longer maintenance responsibility by france.""the french-made dassault rafale is a multirole fighter jet capable of doing a wide range of missionsthe announcement in paris took everyone by complete surprise because nobody had any inkling of what was in modi's mind when he left for france. no wonder, therefore, that then defence minister manohar parrikar was left with no choice but to distance himself from the deal. he told doordarshan on april 13, 2015, ""modi-ji took the decision; i back it up"". he told ndtv that the decision was ""the outcome of a discussion between the prime minister and president of france"".there was no explanation as to how the number of planes was suddenly reduced from 126 to 36. there was no explanation as to why we made a mockery of ""make in india"" by not insisting on the production of these planes in india. there was no explanation as to why prime minister modi completely disregarded the firmly-established defence procurement procedure in pushing through this new deal.two questions, apart from many other relevant ones, are naturally occupying the minds of people as the controversy rages. the first is price and the delivery schedule of the planes; the second is the appointment of the anil ambani's reliance defence as the major offset partner. as far as the first is concerned, they were supposed to be on better terms than the earlier proposal. so, if the earlier proposal was likely to cost 90,000 crores for 126 planes, or 715 crores per plane, according to parrikar's own statement to doordarshan on april 13, 2015, then why has the price now gone up to nearly 1700 crores or so per aircraft? this becomes even more startling when we compare this with the statement made by the minister of state of defence in lok sabha on november 18, 2016, wherein he said, ""an intergovernmental agreement with the government of french republic has been signed on 23. 09. 2016 for purchase of 36 rafale aircraft along with requisite equipment services and weapons. cost of each rafale aircraft is approximately 670 crore. all the aircraft will be delivered by april 2022.""ceo of dassault aviation eric trappier, anil ambani and french defence minister florence parlyis it not open to the government to now argue that the interpretation of ""aircraft along with equipment, services and weapons"" means merely the basic platform of the aircraft, and does not include the ""india-specific enhancements""?as far as delivery is concerned, it will not be completed before 2022. so, it is no better than the earlier upa government proposal. thus, we have lost both in price and in delivery schedules.as far as the offset agreement is concerned, dassault is under obligation to import from indian entities goods worth 50% of the value of the total contract. so, if the value of the 36 aircraft is rs 60,000 crore or so, dassault has to import from india items worth rs 30,000 crore. reliance defence has been given 70% share of the offset obligation; so its share amounts to 21,000 crores.the first question which arises, therefore, is why was hal, which was knocked out of manufacturing this aircraft, also denied the opportunity to be a major offset partner? why was reliance defence brought in which has no experience in this field? the government's case that the supplier, namely dassault, was free to choose its offset partners and the government had nothing to do with it, in fact, it was unaware of it, has been torn apart by the statement of former president hollande, who says that he had no choice in the matter after the government of india's recommendation to select reliance defence.these and many more are question that are troubling the minds of the people. to sum up,1. why did the prime minister make a complete mockery of the firmly established defence procurement procedure in finalising a totally new proposal to buy 36 aircraft only during his visit to paris?googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display(""adslotnativevideo""); });2. by reducing the number of aircraft from 126 to 36, has he not put national security in peril?3. by knocking out hal completely from the deal, has he not made a mockery of his own much-advertised ""make in india"" programme?4. does not the introduction of an inexperienced private party as a major offset partner and that too at the pm's own recommendation raise serious doubts about the integrity of the deal?5. why is the government hiding behind technicalities and refusing to reveal the truth if there is nothing suspicious about it?6. why is the government running away from an enquiry into the deal if its hands are clean?

2018-10-26,rafale shows how rahul gandhi has matured as a leader,"the optically-dodgy rafale deal has finally turned rahul gandhi, congress president, into a real leader. gandhi, who was arrested today for protesting outside the cbi headquarters, has been consistent on what he calls the ""rafale scam""; his stand has placed him on the same side as yashwant sinha, arun shourie and prashant bhushan; most if not all other opposition leaders have been weak-willed or ineffectual in accusing the modi government of crony capitalism at the least and outright corruption at worst in signing up for 36 fighter jets from france. this is possibly the one issue where gandhi has displayed heartland political smarts, hit the streets, used it as a hot button campaign issue in rajasthan and madhya pradesh and, most importantly, set the agenda and the narrative. none of this comes naturally to him. but he has, from the beginning, used the rafale controversy to hit straight at modi, accusing the ""chowkidar"" of ""chori."" with this catchy if crude idiom, gandhi has scored in rafale against the pm who is a master at setting the narrative; to be fair, gandhi has been vastly enabled by the modi government seemingly losing the plot with the late-night coup that saw cbi chief alok verma being forced from his office.congress president rahul gandhi led a protest outside the cbi headquarters in new delhigandhi has smartly broken down rafale for dummies. ""billionaire friend helped by crooked pm"" is the communication strategy and it seems to be working as well as ""suit boot ki sarkar"" as defining image of the modi sarkar.gandhi now even has support from his fractious allies. sensing the traction of the issue, mamata banerjee the most temperamental putative ally of gandhi, sent her troops today to join in the agitation.this is perhaps the first time that gandhi has individually been able to carry along opposition leaders who belong to a different generation and who were not about to give him any quarter in occupying opposition centerstage.congress chief rahul gandhi said that the main reason for the removal of alok verma was that the cbi was beginning an investigation in pm role's in the rafale deal (file photo)says a senior congress leader from rajasthan where gandhi campaigned yesterday, ""this is the first time i have seen crowds at rallies hang on to gandhi's word. they seem to believe his story. perhaps because he has identified rafale as the most potent issue and a shorthand for modi's (mis)deeds. remember this - i am telling you we are winning rajasthan and that will give us energy to push for 2019.""i would normally dismiss this as the heirloom hopes of the congress but because gandhi has plugged away at rafale, he has forced the other leaders to finally use it to target modi.india has signed an agreement with france to buy 36 rafale fighter jetsunpredictable on and off ally ncp chief sharad pawar who had earlier ""ghosted"" gandhi on rafale, going to the extent of issuing modi a personal certificate of honesty, has now meekly fallen into line. pawar had no choice as his party read him the riot act and ahmed patel, the congress's new treasurer told him bluntly to decide on his relationship status with the opposition. pawar had to commit and do the deal on seats in maharashtra from his earlier dalliance with modi and shah.gandhi has been equally tough with his party, well aware of the fact that the rafale deal, since it was negotiated personally by modi, cannot be fobbed off by the government onto other officials. he issued orders that all spokies had to focus on the rafale deal, even those who supposedly have relationships with the anil ambani group. gandhi's office monitored appearances on tv channels for a week and two spokesman were pulled up.gandhi also told his party's legal eagles that they could no longer keep retainers or appear for anil ambani in court. says a senior leader ,""they were told you are either with the congress or anil ambani. that was the end of the cosy relationship"".the bjp's shrill attacks on gandhi calling him a ""clown prince"" and ""serial liar"" have raised his public profile, and because the bjp reacts so viscerally to him, he is now taken more seriously across the political spectrum. the moment 17 bjp ministers rush to tv channels to decry how they don't take gandhi seriously, they give the game away.politics is always about irony. rajiv gandhi, rahul's father, had the most brutal majority in the history of indian politics. he lost it all because of the the bofors arms deal. decades later, his son has come of age on another defence deal.(swati chaturvedi is an author and a journalist who has worked with the indian express, the statesman and the hindustan times.)googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display(""adslotnativevideo""); });disclaimer: the opinions expressed within this article are the personal opinions of the author. the facts and opinions appearing in the article do not reflect the views of ndtv and ndtv does not assume any responsibility or liability for the same.",0.029698625600264938,rafale shows rahul gandhi matured leader,"optically-dodgy rafale deal finally turned rahul gandhi , congress president , real leader. gandhi , arrested today protesting outside cbi headquarters , consistent calls "" rafale scam "" ; stand placed side yashwant sinha , arun shourie prashant bhushan ; opposition leaders weak-willed ineffectual accusing modi government crony capitalism least outright corruption worst signing 36 fighter jets france. possibly one issue gandhi displayed heartland political smarts , hit streets , used hot button campaign issue rajasthan madhya pradesh , importantly , set agenda narrative. none comes naturally him. , beginning , used rafale controversy hit straight modi , accusing "" chowkidar "" "" chori.

2018-10-28,opinion: cbi drama shows rafale scandal can undo modi government - by yashwant sinha,"the supreme court of india has done exactly what any intervener in a war would have done. there was a civil war going on in the cbi. the war was set in motion by the government of india in order to serve its petty little interests like preventing an investigation into the rafale deal. at one stage, however, it lost control; the prime minister's personal intervention was also of no avail and the whole affair turned ugly and came hurtling out into the open.like the press conference of the four senior-most judges of the supreme court in january this year, the war within the cbi was also an unprecedented event in the history of independent india. the special director of the cbi, an officer who was appointed to that post ignoring all protests to the contrary, wrote letters to the central vigilance commission (cvc) and the cabinet secretary making serious allegations of corruption against the director of the cbi. the director, who was investigating allegations of corruption against the special director, got an fir filed against him. a dy. s. p. rank officer of the cbi, who was allegedly a henchman of the special director, was actually arrested by the agency, produced in the cbi court and was placed in custody. the prime minister called both the director, cbi, and the special director, but even his personal intervention was of no avail.then the government did what it should never have done. in a midnight operation reminiscent of the emergency days, it disabled both the officers, sent them on forced leave, appointed a junior officer of the rank of joint director as the interim head of the agency and transferred a whole lot of other officers. the officer who was investigating the case against the special director was transferred to the andamans. the country watched these shocking developments in horror and disbelief. then, all concerned, the cbi director, the special director and the ngo common cause rushed to the supreme court with their complaints.cbi director alok verma has challenged the centre's action in the supreme court.the court has passed an interim order and has posted the matter for the next hearing on november 12. its interim order is like a ceasefire order. it has directed all concerned to disengage and stop shooting at each other so that peace could be restored in the organization. it has not touched for the time being the other contentious issues like whether the government has the power to ask the cbi director to proceed on forced leave and stop him from discharging his functions without actually transferring him. that will obviously come later. the court has not entertained the petition of the special director. it has directed the cvc to finish the enquiry into the corruption charges leveled against the director by the special director within two weeks, rejecting his request to extend it to three weeks. but in a major show of distrust in the cvc, it has ordered that a retired judge of the supreme court, justice ak patnaik, will supervise the enquiry. the interim director of the cbi, nageshwar rao, has been directed not to take any policy decisions or any major decisions. he has been allowed to perform only the routine tasks that are essential to keep the cbi functional. the court has also directed that the list of all the decisions taken by him after assuming charge, including decisions with regard to transfer of investigations, change of investigating officers, ""etc, etc"" would be furnished to the court in a sealed cover on or before november 12.the order of the supreme court should restore peace in the cbi for the present and enable its headquarters and its far-flung offices all over the country to function normally without any hindrance. so a ceasefire has been enforced, the warring factions have been restrained and a final decision on the other contentious legal issues has been postponed for the next hearing. so far, so good or so bad. the conclusion, however, is irrefutable - that the credibility of the premier investigating agency of the country has been damaged almost beyond repair and the government at the highest level has covered itself with mud and presented to the country a textbook example of how not to handle a sensitive situation.rakesh asthana had written to the chief vigilance commission that cbi director alok verma had taken bribe from a businessman being investigated by the agency.once again, it has fallen to the lot of the supreme court to intervene in a chaotic situation created by the government and restore some sanity. at the same time, it has presented an opportunity for all concerned, specially the supreme court, to set things right in a manner which will hold good for some decades to come. but more importantly, the cbi imbroglio clearly shows that the ""strong"" government of narendra modi has finally lost control over governance in its fifth and final year in office. the cbi director and special director did not listen to the prime minister's advice. the reserve bank of india, which the government tried to turn into another ""caged parrot"", now refuses to tamely follow its directions. even the deputy governor, viral acharya, feels free to openly challenge the government on the question of the autonomy of the bank. the officers of the government of india will do only what is most essential and otherwise refuse to take any risks. key posts have remained unfilled for months and years. in the meanwhile, the economy is moving from one crisis to another with a finance minister who appears to be in charge of everything except finance. the government has simply lost the plot and is only firefighting.googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display(""adslotnativevideo""); });the rafale deal has already done a lot of damage. it has the potential to destroy this government.yashwant sinha, former bjp leader, was minister of finance (1998-2002) and minister of external affairs (2002-2004)disclaimer: the opinions expressed within this article are the personal opinions of the author. the facts and opinions appearing in the article do not reflect the views of ndtv and ndtv does not assume any responsibility or liability for the same.",0.038458565244279534,opinion : cbi drama shows rafale scandal undo modi government -

2018-10-28,opinion: cbi drama shows rafale scandal can undo modi government - by yashwant sinha,"the supreme court of india has done exactly what any intervener in a war would have done. there was a civil war going on in the cbi. the war was set in motion by the government of india in order to serve its petty little interests like preventing an investigation into the rafale deal. at one stage, however, it lost control; the prime minister's personal intervention was also of no avail and the whole affair turned ugly and came hurtling out into the open.like the press conference of the four senior-most judges of the supreme court in january this year, the war within the cbi was also an unprecedented event in the history of independent india. the special director of the cbi, an officer who was appointed to that post ignoring all protests to the contrary, wrote letters to the central vigilance commission (cvc) and the cabinet secretary making serious allegations of corruption against the director of the cbi. the director, who was investigating allegations of corruption against the special director, got an fir filed against him. a dy. s. p. rank officer of the cbi, who was allegedly a henchman of the special director, was actually arrested by the agency, produced in the cbi court and was placed in custody. the prime minister called both the director, cbi, and the special director, but even his personal intervention was of no avail.then the government did what it should never have done. in a midnight operation reminiscent of the emergency days, it disabled both the officers, sent them on forced leave, appointed a junior officer of the rank of joint director as the interim head of the agency and transferred a whole lot of other officers. the officer who was investigating the case against the special director was transferred to the andamans. the country watched these shocking developments in horror and disbelief. then, all concerned, the cbi director, the special director and the ngo common cause rushed to the supreme court with their complaints.cbi director alok verma has challenged the centre's action in the supreme court.the court has passed an interim order and has posted the matter for the next hearing on november 12. its interim order is like a ceasefire order. it has directed all concerned to disengage and stop shooting at each other so that peace could be restored in the organization. it has not touched for the time being the other contentious issues like whether the government has the power to ask the cbi director to proceed on forced leave and stop him from discharging his functions without actually transferring him. that will obviously come later. the court has not entertained the petition of the special director. it has directed the cvc to finish the enquiry into the corruption charges leveled against the director by the special director within two weeks, rejecting his request to extend it to three weeks. but in a major show of distrust in the cvc, it has ordered that a retired judge of the supreme court, justice ak patnaik, will supervise the enquiry. the interim director of the cbi, nageshwar rao, has been directed not to take any policy decisions or any major decisions. he has been allowed to perform only the routine tasks that are essential to keep the cbi functional. the court has also directed that the list of all the decisions taken by him after assuming charge, including decisions with regard to transfer of investigations, change of investigating officers, ""etc, etc"" would be furnished to the court in a sealed cover on or before november 12.the order of the supreme court should restore peace in the cbi for the present and enable its headquarters and its far-flung offices all over the country to function normally without any hindrance. so a ceasefire has been enforced, the warring factions have been restrained and a final decision on the other contentious legal issues has been postponed for the next hearing. so far, so good or so bad. the conclusion, however, is irrefutable - that the credibility of the premier investigating agency of the country has been damaged almost beyond repair and the government at the highest level has covered itself with mud and presented to the country a textbook example of how not to handle a sensitive situation.rakesh asthana had written to the chief vigilance commission that cbi director alok verma had taken bribe from a businessman being investigated by the agency.once again, it has fallen to the lot of the supreme court to intervene in a chaotic situation created by the government and restore some sanity. at the same time, it has presented an opportunity for all concerned, specially the supreme court, to set things right in a manner which will hold good for some decades to come. but more importantly, the cbi imbroglio clearly shows that the ""strong"" government of narendra modi has finally lost control over governance in its fifth and final year in office. the cbi director and special director did not listen to the prime minister's advice. the reserve bank of india, which the government tried to turn into another ""caged parrot"", now refuses to tamely follow its directions. even the deputy governor, viral acharya, feels free to openly challenge the government on the question of the autonomy of the bank. the officers of the government of india will do only what is most essential and otherwise refuse to take any risks. key posts have remained unfilled for months and years. in the meanwhile, the economy is moving from one crisis to another with a finance minister who appears to be in charge of everything except finance. the government has simply lost the plot and is only firefighting.googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display(""adslotnativevideo""); });the rafale deal has already done a lot of damage. it has the potential to destroy this government.yashwant sinha, former bjp leader, was minister of finance (1998-2002) and minister of external affairs (2002-2004)disclaimer: the opinions expressed within this article are the personal opinions of the author. the facts and opinions appearing in the article do not reflect the views of ndtv and ndtv does not assume any responsibility or liability for the same.",0.038458565244279534,opinion : cbi drama shows rafale scandal undo modi government -
