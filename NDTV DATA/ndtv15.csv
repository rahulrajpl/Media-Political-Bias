2011-09-15,2g spectrum scam: the story so far,"new delhi: it's been labelled the biggest scam in india's history. the loss to the national exchequer is pegged by the government auditor at a mind-boggling rs 1.76 lakh crore. the 2g scam has already seen a cabinet minister, an mp, corporate bigwigs - some of the biggest names in the telecom industry - going to jail.the prime accused in the case is former telecom minister a raja, who the cbi has described as the mastermind of the scam. he stands accused of under-valuing spectrum as the country's telecom minister and selling it to companies he favoured, though they were largely ineligible for licenses to run mobile networks. though the spectrum scam had loomed over his ministry since the sale of 2g frequency to telecom operators in 2008, it was in november 2010 that mr raja finally exited the government. what pushed him through the out-door was a report by the government's auditor. he had to resign in much ignominy and just two months later, on february 2 this year, he was arrested. mr raja faces charges of criminal conspiracy, cheating and forgery under the ipc and abuse of official position and corruption charges under the prevention of corruption act.but mr raja claims he only followed government policy, one approved by the prime minister and former finance minister p chidambaram. his lawyer has also told the court that he might summon the pm as a witness in the case to prove that there was no loss.the long list of the accused in the case includes dmk mp and former tamil nadu chief minister m karunanidhi's daughter kanimozhi, who too has been in jail since may 20 this year. also in jail are former telecom secretary siddharth behura and raja's former personal secretary rk chandolia. they also face charges of conspiracy, cheating, and abusing official position.high-profile corporate honchos facing charges in the case are - sanjay chandra, former md, unitech wireless; shahid balwa, promoter of db realty and swan telecom; vinod goenka, promoter and md, db realty and swan telecom; gautam doshi, group md, anil dhirubhai ambani group (adag); and hari nair and surendra pipara, senior vice presidents, adag. most face charges of cheating and criminal conspiracy. shahid balwa has also been charged with bribing a public servant, while sanjay chandra has only been charged with criminal conspiracy. they were arrested on april 20 this year.telecom companies swan telecom, reliance telecom and unitech wireless have been named in the chargesheet. the cbi says swan and unitech were granted licenses despite being ineligible.these high profile individuals and companies were named in the first chargesheet on april 2. then, another supplementary chargesheet was filed on april 25. this chargesheet named ms kanimozhi, kalaignar tv md sarath kumar, directors of kusegaon fruits and vegetables asif balwa and rajeev aggarwal, promoter of cineyug films karim morani. they too face charges of cheating and criminal conspiracy. kanimozhi and sarath kumar have also been charged with taking a bribe.the cbi claims it has uncovered the money trail involving swan telecom. it says swan paid a bribe of rs 200 crore to dmk-owned kalaignar tv through a maze of subsidiaries in exchange for the 2g spectrum and licenses.googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display(""adslotnativevideo""); });kanimozhi has been named the active brain behind kalaignar tv. the dmk mp has denied the charges against her saying she was not involved in the day to day functioning of the channel and that the money in question was only a loan, duly returned with interest. the cbi has rubbished that defence.the cbi says it has ""prima facie evidence"" against all the accused, enough to proceed with trial. the cbi alleges that the scam caused a loss of rs 30,984.55 crore to the exchequer.but the investigating agency has received some setbacks recently. the telecom regulatory authority of india (trai) has said in court that it had never recommended an auction for the 2g spectrum and that it was not possible to quantify losses. the accused insist this supports their case and weakens the cbi's charges. they claim the case does not withstand legal scrutiny as the prime minister and the present telecom minister kapil sibal too were on record that the state did not incur any loss. in another major jolt to the cbi, the law ministry gave its opinion that swan cannot be termed an associate of reliance telecom. the cbi, in its chargesheet, has described swan as a front for reliance. the chargesheet says swan was set up ""out of the funds of reliance"" to allow anil ambani's company to access more spectrum and resources than was legally allowed for a single company. also, the central board of direct taxes says swan and unitech never sold their licenses to their foreign partners and that the sale of equity was above board. equally interesting is the cbi's own admission, that it has found no money trail in the case of unitech. in april, the cbi had told the court that unitech ""fraudulently concealed critical information"" to disguise the fact that it was ineligible for a license. a delhi court is expected to pronounce today its order on framing of charges against the accused in the scam. special cbi judge o p saini, who heard arguments on behalf of the accused and the cbi for over a month on day-to-day basis, had reserved order on august 29.",0.036745516388373534,2g spectrum scam : story far,"new delhi : ' labelled biggest scam india ' history. loss national exchequer pegged government auditor mind-boggling rs 1.76 lakh crore. 2g scam already seen cabinet minister , mp , corporate bigwigs - biggest names telecom industry - going jail.the prime accused case former telecom minister raja , cbi described mastermind scam. stands accused under-valuing spectrum country ' telecom minister selling companies favoured , though largely ineligible licenses run mobile networks. though spectrum scam loomed ministry since sale 2g frequency telecom operators 2008 , november 2010 mr raja finally exited government. pushed out-door report government ' auditor. resign much ignominy two months later , february 2 year , arrested. mr raja faces charges criminal conspiracy , cheating forgery ipc abuse official position corruption charges prevention corruption act.but mr raja claims followed government policy , one approved prime minister former finance minister p chidambaram. lawyer also told court might summon pm witness case prove loss.the long list accused case includes dmk mp former tamil nadu chief minister karunanidhi ' daughter kanimozhi , jail since may 20 year. also jail former telecom secretary siddharth behura raja ' former personal secretary rk chandolia. also face charges conspiracy , cheating , abusing official position.high-profile corporate honchos facing charges case - sanjay chandra , former md , unitech wireless ;

2011-11-11,"2g scam: raja, kanimozhi and others go on trial today","new delhi: the much-awaited trial in the 2g spectrum allocation scam case, involving high-profile accused like former telecom minister a raja, dmk mp kanimozhi, top corporate honchos and telecom firms, will begin in a delhi court today.a raja, rajya sabha mp kanimozhi and the executives of some of india's biggest telecoms will stand trial for criminal breach of trust - a charge that carries a maximum sentence of life imprisonment. a delhi court headed by judge op saini had on october 22 accepted all the charges levelled by the cbi against the 14 individuals and three companies - reliance telecom, unitech wireless and swan telecom - listed as principal players in the 2g scam. the cbi's charges against them range from criminal conspiracy to forgery and cheating.but the most serious charges in the case, controversially introduced by the cbi just a few weeks ago, are criminal breach of trust by a public servant for mr raja and siddharth behura, who was telecom secretary, and criminal conspiracy to cause criminal breach of trust by a public servant for the 12 others. the maximum sentence for these charges is life imprisonment. (2g scam: charges against raja, others)top corporate executives of reliance anil dhirubhai ambani group (adag) are likely to be first among the over 150 witnesses named by the cbi to be examined by the special court, set up exclusively by the supreme court to deal with the 2g case.in the first list, the cbi has named 28 persons to be examined as prosecution witnesses before the court in the month of november.as the trial begins, the spotlight will remain relentlessly on mr raja and kanimozhi, the daughter of heavyweight southern politician m karunanidhi who heads the dmk, a major partner in the upa coalition at the centre. the arrest of his favourite child has tested the collaboration between the congress and his party, though both sides have on record reiterated that their partnership is steady.expressing concern over the continued incarceration of his daughter kanimozhi, mr karunanidhi yesterday said if courts ""hesitated"" to provide legal rights, it could cast a question mark on the country's democracy. ""if courts, one of the pillars of indian democracy, hesitated to provide legal rights and protect the basics of the law, a question will rise in everybody's mind where indian democracy is going and about its future,"" he wrote in his party's mouthpiece murasoli.mr raja has been in jail since february. telecom executives like sanjay chandra of unitech wireless and gautam doshi, hari nair and surendra pipara of reliance telecom were imprisoned in april. kanimozhi was arrested in may. (in pics: a-listers in tihar)because the charges framed now, the 14 people accused may have a better shot at leaving jail. all of them except mr raja have already applied for bail. the cbi, which had opposed two petitions by ms kanimozhi for bail in the past few months, did not fight her latest request. however, that was turned down by special judge op saini on november 3. the rajya sabha mp has now appealed against that verdict in the delhi high court. that plea is likely to be heard on december 1.the telecom scam was webbed, according to the cbi, in 2008 by mr raja when he was telecom minister. he ignored advice, including from the prime minister, to auction second-generation or 2g spectrum. instead, he allotted licences and accompanying second-generation or 2g spectrum on a first-come-first-serve basis that were twisted to help companies mr raja allegedly conspired with. the minister set a deadline for filing applications in september 2008; in january 2010, he made a last-minute announcement that licences would be given to those who filed their ""letters of intent"" first. the deadline for filing these documents and cheques was within hours of mr raja's revision of rules. a few companies like swan and unitech were ready with their cheques - the cbi believes they had been tipped off by the minister. and amid a fair amount of chaos, 122 licences were issued to nine companies at a cost of rs. 1600 crores each.swan telecom allegedly repaid mr raja with a 214-crore cheque routed through a maze of companies to kalaignar tv, a local channel in chennai. kanimozhi and her stepmother own 80 per cent of the channel. kanimozhi's lawyers have said the money was a loan which was returned with interest, and that she was not involved with the daily management of the company. the cbi has contested this, describing her as ""the active brain"" behind kalaignar. the agency has said it has uncovered the money trail for this bribe.mr raja, like the others accused, has rejected all charges against him. in his defence, he said that the prime minister, and p chidambaram who was finance minister at the time, were kept informed of his plan of action. if they disagreed with his guidelines, he has challenged, they could have over-ruled him. he has also threatened to call the pm as a witness.googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display(""adslotnativevideo""); });the telecom scam hurtled the government into crisis mode, when the government's auditor declared the scam had cost india rs. 1.76 lakh crores, forcing a reluctant mr raja to resign as telecom minister. the cbi has said it believes the losses are in the range of rs. 30,000 crores. the government's regulator for telecom policy - trai - has said it does not believe there were any losses since it does not believe spectrum should have been auctioned.many of the cbi's heftiest accusations have been contested by the government. for example, the cbi says the three reliance executives in jail - gautam doshi, surender pipara and hari nair- set up swan telecom as a front for their company to collect more spectrum and licences than were legally permissible. but the law ministry has said that after examining the details, swan cannot technically be considered ""an associate"" of reliance.the cbi alleges both swan and unitech wireless made huge profits by buying their 2g licences cheaply and then selling stake to foreign partners at huge profits. telecom minister kapil sibal has said that the transactions were legal because ""what occurred was dilution of equity and not the sale of equity."" like mr sibal, who infamously declared in january this year that the telecom scam had not caused any losses to the national exchequer, the government's regulatory body for telecom- trai - has undermined the cbi by stating that it does not believe spectrum should have been auctioned. any losses calculated, trai insists, are prone to error because they are based on presumptive market conditions and prices. the cbi has also said in court that it has not found any evidence of a kickback from mr chandra's unitech wireless to mr raja.the 2g trial commences at a time when the country is in the mood to hold politicians accountable for the rot that has been backlit by a series of swindles. the net worth of the 2g scam allows it to grab top spot on that list. the anti-corruption movement headed by gandhian anna hazare delivered such massive crowds that the opposition has quickly scrambled to appropriate the agenda, with lk advani of the bjp launching a rath yatra to promote ""clean governance.""mr raja's repeated references to the prime minister and p chidambaram have echoed within all opposition parties who say the pm must take accountability for allowing the telecom scam to play out. a document from the finance ministry, prepared this year, caused a political seizure - it said mr chidambaram could have enforced an auction of spectrum when he was finance minister and mr raja was busy mapping out a crooked policy. the excavation of that document by a right to information activist allowed the opposition to demand with more surety the resignation of mr chidambaram, who is now home minister. a week after the document was presented in the supreme court, finance minister pranab mukherjee clarified it was prepared with inputs from different ministries, and that he did not agree with all of its inferences. various petitioners like janata party president subramanian swamy have said the supreme court should order the cbi to investigate mr chidambaram's role. though the cbi has said this is not needed, the supreme court has yet to indicate its stand.the complete list of those accused in the 2g scamformer telecom minister a raja;

2011-11-15,2g loss row: top auditor appears before parliamentary panel,"new delhi: a crucial meeting of the joint parliamentary committee (jpc) probing the 2g spectrum scam is taking place today in the capital. the committee is questioning the government's top auditing body that came up with the loss figures.the committee is examining the comptroller and auditor general (cag) of india, vinod rai. former director general of audit, rp singh, testified before the committee yesterday. the two had serious differences over the loss figures that have been mired in controversy.during his testimony mr singh said that he sticks to the stand he has taken all along - that the losses from the scam cannot be quantified, and that he was asked to sign on a report that declared the losses to be worth 1.76 lakh crores. mr singh had told his department that the presumptive losses were in the range of 2600 crores.the testimony of rp singh will boost the case of the government, which has been battered heavily by the swindle;
