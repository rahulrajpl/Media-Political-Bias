2013-10-10,wal-mart drops ambitious expansion plan for india,"mumbai: wal-mart stores gave up on india's huge market on wednesday, announcing that it had indefinitely delayed its once-ambitious plans to open hundreds of superstores across the country.the announcement adds to the gloom enrobing the indian economy. growth has sharply slowed and the value of the rupee has fallen starkly in recent months. it also suggests that the government's efforts to lure more foreign investment are failing, but the governing united progressive alliance's plan has never been popular with india's politically vocal retailers.wal-mart, the bentonville, ark., company that is the world's largest retailer, also announced that it was ending its joint effort with bharti enterprises of india to operate 20 wholesale ""cash-and-carry"" stores that sell to other businesses like retailers, hotels and restaurants. wal-mart plans to buy bharti's 50 percent stake in the venture, and the two companies will operate independent businesses in india. that wal-mart kept the wholesale business, long seen as a way to learn about india's fragmented retailing sector, suggests that the company has not entirely ended its hopes of eventually selling at a retail level.in 2007, wal-mart announced with great fanfare that it planned to open along with bharti ""hundreds"" of stores, the kind of ambitious proposition that many international companies hatched early in the century as hopes blossomed that india would soon join china as an emerging economic colossus. but many of those same companies have shelved their expansion plans after complex market conditions - fitful electricity, poor roads and government ineptitude - frustrated hopes of rapid profits.wal-mart's chief executive for asia, scott price, said this week that the indian government's regulations requiring foreign retailers to buy 30 percent of products from local small and midsize businesses were the ""critical stumbling block"" to opening its trademark consumer stores.""i don't understand how this 30 percent small and medium enterprise can be executed,"" price said in an interview monday at the asia-pacific economic cooperation forum in bali, indonesia, the associated press reported.he said that indian retailers were not required to follow the same rule, which made it too difficult for outsiders to make money, because no enterprise small enough to meet the government's requirements had the capability to produce on the scale that a giant retailer requires.""for wal-mart, there has been frustration brewing for a long time about the obstacles to doing business in india and the changing configurations of what it could do and what it couldn't do,"" said devangshu dutta, chief executive of third eyesight, a bangalore-based retail consulting firm. ""to just continue to pump in money without reflecting on this would be pointless.""u.s. executives and politicians have been expressing growing impatience with india's fitful efforts to open and modernize its economy. the government sought to address some of this frustration with a series of overhauls over the past year that ministers hoped would lead major international retailers to invest substantial sums in improving the country's retail infrastructure, which is predominately mom-and-pop shops. so far, no company has.googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display(""adslotnativevideo""); });only 4 percent of india's $500 billion retail market is controlled by large, western-style chain stores. in china, the share is about 20 percent and in brazil 36 percent. india's tiny operators have few of the inventory controls of their larger brethren, and much of the country's food spoils before reaching consumers - a heartbreaking reality in a nation where nearly half of all children are malnourished.with national elections scheduled for next year, there is little hope that any new policy changes will be put in place anytime soon. looser rules enacted in september led an important regional political party to withdraw from the governing coalition, briefly threatening the coalition's viability. india's main opposition party, the bharatiya janata party, has opposed efforts to loosen foreign investment rules. critics say that wal-mart would put thousands of small retailers out of business, increasing unemployment.""i don't see any big foreign retailers entering the market at least for the next nine months, until after the general elections, when we know what the direction will be of the policy,"" said saloni nangia, president of technopak, a management consulting firm based in gurgaon. ""it is a wait and watch for many international retailers who want to be in india eventually.""wal-mart's problems in india extend well beyond the government's procurement rules. the indian authorities are investigating whether wal-mart violated foreign investment rules by giving bharti retail an interest-free loan of $100 million that could later be converted into a controlling stake in the company. both companies deny wrongdoing.in november, the joint venture between wal-mart and bharti suspended several senior executives and delayed some store openings as part of an internal bribery investigation, one of a series of bribery inquiries that have rocked wal-mart's international operations. in june, the joint venture replaced its chief executive.girish kuber, a former political editor of the economic times, called the dissolution of the wal-mart and bharti partnership ""inevitable.""""it is a sad story,"" he said.

2013-12-17,"ikea stores in india closer to reality, wal-mart still a far cry","new delhi: in a country where haggling is the name of the game when it comes to trade, it is only apt that the highlight of 2013 for the indian retail story is the hard bargains by multinationals with the government over foreign investment norms in the sector.be it swedish furniture retailer ikea's push to let it open cafeterias at its outlets as part of its rs 10,500 crore investment in india or wal-mart's quibble over sourcing requirements for foreign multi-brand retailers, there was no end to pushing the envelope.ironically, however, when the government agreed to dilute the sourcing criteria wal-mart decided to part ways with its indian cash and carry partner bharti ending their six-year-old partnership.in a year marked by economic downturn, the estimated $500 billion retail sector in india saw growth slowing down to 10-11 per cent from high double digits growth earlier, according to boston consulting group, asia pacific leader (consumer and retail practice) abheek singhi.the silver lining, however, was that many companies moved closer to profitability during the year and more urban consumers migrated from traditional stores to modern format he added.when it came to fdi inflows in india's multi-brand segment, the year had nothing to show but the single brand had plenty to cheer.after a series of presentations by its officials, the government approved ikea's rs 10,500 crore proposal in may paving way for it to set up home furnishing stores along with cafeterias in the country. earlier, as per the government policy the company was not allowed to open cafes and restaurants at its stores.besides ikea, the single brand segment also saw the likes of french sports goods retailer decathlon, fashion brand promod, crockery maker le creuset, fossil inc and hennes & mauritz bringing in fdi worth about rs 1,470 crore.ikea had proposed setting up 10 furnishing and homeware stores as well as allied infrastructure in over 10 years in india. subsequently, it planned to open 15 more stores. it has already identified haryana, andhra pradesh, maharashtra and karnataka as possible states to set up its stores.so far, ikea's has been the largest investment in single-brand segment ever since the government allowed 100 per cent foreign investment in this sector last year.the multi-brand segment, however, had no such story. both foreign and domestic retail firms, including wal-mart, tesco, carrefour, bharti, aditya birla group, tatas, reliance and pantaloon wanted government to change fdi norms.the various firms wanted sourcing rules similar to that of single brand retailers, who are allowed to ""preferably"" source from small and medium enterprises (smes), and also allow to put only 50 per cent of first tranche of foreign investment in back-end infrastructure.wal-mart had, in fact, told the government that it could not meet the sourcing norm in the multi-brand segment that requires 30 per cent procurement from small industries, stating it can procure only about 20 per cent.heeding to the request of retailers, government eased norms for fdi in multi-brand segment, diluting the contentious sourcing clause and allowed global multi-brand retailers to source 30 per cent of their products from small and medium enterprises only at the time of start of business.the foreign chains were also given the green signal to set up stores in cities with less than ten lakh population to accommodate demands of the likes wal-mart and tesco.the investment requirement on back-end infrastructure by a foreign retailer was also kept at 50 per cent of the first tranche of investment only. the mandatory requirement is that foreign retailers have to bring in a minimum of $100 million capital for setting up shops in the country.the move came under fire from opposition bjp that accused the upa government of surrendering before global retailers.looking back, mr singhi said: ""the policies were inconsistent. the government could have done better and if the aim was to promote local manufacturing, it could have simply raised the requirement to 50-60 per cent without restricting it to small and medium enterprises.""contrary to expectations, instead of going ahead and announcing its multi-brand segment plans for india post the relaxation of fdi norms, wal-mart said it was parting ways with its indian partner bharti enterprises.the us retail major announced that it would buy out its indian partner in their 50:50 cash-and-carry joint venture bharti walmart, which runs 20 wholesale stores under the best price modern wholesale brand in india, for an undisclosed sum.bharti will in turn acquire $100 million of compulsory convertible debentures (ccds) held by wal-mart in cedar support services, a company owned and controlled by the indian firm.stating that fdi norms in india played a part in its break-up with bharti enterprises, the company said it was studying the feasibility of the policy in multi-brand retail before finalising plans to enter the segment.for wal-mart, it was also a case of setting its house in order before going for expansion in india's multi-brand segment. it could heave a sigh of relief when the enforcement directorate, which probed alleged contravention of foreign exchange

""we will continue to serve the shopkeepers, kiranas and farmers using that format and grow our that business in india,"" said mcmillon, who was here to attend the world economic forum (wef) annual meeting. when asked about registering a new company in india earlier this month, he said that walmart is positioning itself for the future, but the focus for the moment remains on best price cash and carry format. the retailer has registered a new company called 'wal-mart india private ltd' in the country. asked about possible timeline for multi brand entry, the walmart chief said it is not possible as of now to predict any timeline as it would depend on the decision taken by the ""people of india and the government of india with regard to the regulations for foreign direct investment"". ""we will respecfully wait, answer all questions and try to demonstrate that having walmart in india is a good thing for the country,"" he said. after parting ways with bharti group in october last year, walmart had said it was studying the feasibility of india's foreign direct investment (fdi) policy in multi-brand retail before finalising plans to enter the segment. to a question whether walmart was in a wait-and-watch mode because of upcoming general elections, he evaded a direct reply and said, ""we continue to monitor the situation every day. we have a team in india and they are monitoring the things.""

2014-02-05,will try bold tax experiment for delhi: the arvind kejriwal interview,"new delhi: arvind kejriwal, delhi's new chief minister, stormed to power in the national capital in december on an anti-corruption platform.last month, mr kejriwal barred foreign retailers from setting up shop in delhi, a blow to the union government's efforts to attract overseas investment and revive the economy. kejriwal's government has also offered free water and slashed electricity prices, moves critics have derided as populist and dangerous. he spoke about his economic policies in this interview.can you share some of your thoughts on the economy? do you see the aam aadmi party as a socialist party?we actually don't understand all that - socialism, communalism, capitalism, right, left, centre. we are common people, we have our own problems and we want solutions. if someone comes and tells me i have a problem of water, if someone comes and tells me that, hey look, there is a solution in left, we will be very happy to borrow it from there. or if someone else comes and says, look, there is a solution in right, there is a solution in capitalism, we will borrow it from there. we are not wedded to any ideology.you're an expert on tax. what do you think...i think it ought to be simplified to a large extent. it has been made so complex, and in delhi, we will try some experiment. today only we had long meetings on can we do some very bold experiments in delhi as far as taxation is concerned.such as?i can't disclose right now.why not?because we haven't finalised it as yet.you talk about simplifying tax policy. will that be in line with the general service tax proposal?that's also interesting. that's also important.googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display(""adslotnativevideo""); });what about bjp talking about abolishing the income tax proposal. is that a good idea?no, i don't think so. indirect taxes are inflationary. as economy grows, indirect taxes ought to come down. and it's only the direct taxes which remain the main source of revenue. and that's the trend of modern developed countries so you can't abolish income tax.how do you propose generally in delhi to finance your proposals such as reducing the cost of power and issuing some free water. at least in the medium term, there will be a government burden on the subsidy, right?how much is it? the total budget of delhi government is 40,000 crore rupees ($6.4 billion). the subsidies that i have announced is 242 crore rupees ($38.7 million). still there is such a hue and cry. i'm told that golf course in delhi, the cost of that land is, someone told me, is i-don't-know-how-many-thousand crores of rupees, the land that has been given to golf course. and it has been given to them at 15 lakh rupees ($24,000) a month. so when you subsidize the rich in this country, no one minds that. but when you say that we will provide subsidized electricity to the poor people in the country, or when we say that we'll provide subsidized water to the poor people, all hell breaks loose. do you think the private sector has an important role to play in the indian economy?i think at a very broad level the government has no business to be in business. the government should leave business to the private sector. we have to encourage private enterprise and i think india is a country of entrepreneurs. in india, almost every person is a born entrepreneur - a rickshaw-wallah is an entrepreneur, a farmer is an entrepreneur. this entire business and industry is shackled in the rules and regulations - we need to free them from all these rules and regulations. we need to provide them a free environment, honest environment, to do business. if we provide them a good environment, i think india will go ahead leaps and boundshow are you planning to do that?all that you need are good intentions. in delhi for instance, in the last few days we have had meetings on how to simplify the trade in delhi, on vat in delhi, and they are good ideas. so you talk to the people who are facing the problem and they will tell you 'sir, this is the problem.' and you apply your mind and the solutions are there, it is not rocket science. intentions of the people who are governing the system were wrong till now. if you have honest intentions, the solutions are there.your manifesto included not having fdi in retail in delhi. do you oppose fdi in retail at the national level?firstly, we are not against fdi per se, we are not saying fdi should not be in any sector. i think this is something that the decision has to be taken on a sector-to-sector basis. can you give me a few examples where fdi in retail has been successful in some countries? in how many countries fdi is there in retail?i think it depends on your definition of success. and it has become dominant in many, many countries.three or four arguments are being given in favour of fdi in retail. one it is said, it would provide huge choices for the consumers. i admit that. second is that it will provide better prices to the farmers. i dispute that. if you can give me any empirical evidence, this is an evidence that can be taken from various countries. third, is they're saying, that on one hand farmers would get better prices, on the other hand, customers would get cheaper goods. if you could give me the evidence of that. my party did a lot of research. in u.s. itself, wal-mart is facing so much of resistance, right? it has led to so much of unemployment in many countries. in india, when we are struggling so much - there are a large number of people who throng my office every day and they say 'please give me a government job' - people are looking for jobs, people are jobless. we can't have a model where people end up losing jobs rather than getting jobs.this story has been re-formatted and editing from the original story from reuters.© thomson reuters 2014",0.17683240014970786,try bold tax experiment delhi : arvind kejriwal interview,"new delhi : arvind kejriwal , delhi ' new chief minister , stormed power national capital december anti-corruption platform.last month , mr kejriwal barred foreign retailers setting shop delhi , blow union government ' efforts attract overseas investment revive economy. kejriwal ' government also offered free water slashed electricity prices , moves critics derided populist dangerous. spoke economic policies interview.can share thoughts economy ?

2014-05-16,modi is now obliged to drive dramatic change,"(ashok malik is a columnist and writer living in delhi)many cliches have been used to describe narendra modi's sweeping victory in the 2014 general election. it has been seen as a vote for good governance, a mandate against corruption and a rejection of the congress and the upa. it has been called a selection beyond caste and community boundaries, and representative of the growing fatigue with a culture of entitlements. while all of these are true, they don't entirely explain the quantum of modi's - and the bjp's - achievement. this is not a mandate for good governance in that it is not a mandate for better delivery of an old order of governance, with higher efficiency and lower corruption. instead, this is a mandate for a whole new order. it reflects an impatience, an aspiration, a hunger and an ambition in society that has left traditional politics and the fuddy-duddies - even the 40-something fuddy-duddies - of the congress far, far behind. india has voted in a revolution. this is as close to a bastille moment as a democracy will allow.what do people want from modi? frankly, apart from a better life for themselves and their families, jobs and tolerable prices, and the moving away from india's identity as a land of waiting lists, shortages and short-cuts, most people don't have identifiable programmes in mind. that general yearning, that dream of going back to a time of high gdp growth and building a middle-class life, is all most people would express by way of a demand. for the specifics, they trust their leaders - as they did manmohan singh in 2009 or indira gandhi in 1971.by giving modi this massive mandate, by making the bjp the first party in 30 years to win a single-party majority in the lok sabha, the voter has sanctioned a clean-sheet redesign of not just the indian economy but the indian way of doing things. modi is expected to and is obligated and will be required to bring about dramatic change. he has the space, the political capital and the popular approval to do so. what does this amount to in terms of policy? the hesitation and diffidence of the past, including of the upa government, in the fear that a quick move or an innovation would put off one constituency or the other, one community or another identity group, has been proven to be hogwash. by voting for modi across geographies and social barriers, by giving him a truly national mandate, indians have asked - even commanded - him, to borrow from star trek, 'to boldly go where no prime minister has gone before'. googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display(""adslotnativevideo""); });he can announce fdi in about every area, he can privatise air-india on day one, he can overhaul government and merge and de-merge ministries, he can invite technocrats into his council of ministers, he can do anything he wants - india has told him it trusts him. the expectations are overwhelming; they are also scary. yet, modi has no option but to thrust ahead. a gradual, calibrated approach, a belief that there is time to consolidate, that the opposition is weak and the next election is already looking promising, these represent an outmoded thinking. the congress calculated exactly on such lines in 2009. it celebrated as magazines wrote cover stories of how rahul gandhi would win a majority in 2014 and rule for 20 years. that smug overconfidence cost the congress heavily and reduced it to dust in five years. modi, the smartest politician of his generation, cannot afford the same mistake. chances are he already knows that.disclaimer: the opinionsexpressed within this article are the personal opinions of the author.ndtv is not responsible for the accuracy, completeness, suitability, orvalidity of any information on this article. all information is provided on anas-is basis. the information, facts or opinions appearing in the article do notreflect the views of ndtv and ndtv does not assume any responsibility orliability for the same.",0.14402146464646462,modi obliged drive dramatic change,"( ashok malik columnist writer living delhi ) many cliches used describe narendra modi ' sweeping victory 2014 general election. seen vote good governance , mandate corruption rejection congress upa. called selection beyond caste community boundaries , representative growing fatigue culture entitlements. true , ' entirely explain quantum modi ' - bjp ' - achievement. mandate good governance mandate better delivery old order governance , higher efficiency lower corruption. instead , mandate whole new order. reflects impatience , aspiration , hunger ambition society left traditional politics fuddy-duddies - even 40-something fuddy-duddies - congress far , far behind. india voted revolution. close bastille moment democracy allow.what people want modi ?

2014-07-11,budget 2014: government to raise foreign investment limit in insurance,"mumbai: the government plans to nearly double the proportion of foreign investment allowed in the $60-billion (rs 3.6 lakh crore at 1 dollar = 60 rupees) insurance business to 49 per cent, a potential lifeline for a sector starved of capital and squeezed by regulations. the proposal, which requires the approval of both houses of parliament, would bring foreign investment worth up to $2 billion into the sector within a year of its implementation, industry officials estimated on thursday. finance minister arun jaitley said in his maiden budget speech that the ""composite cap"" in the insurance sector should be increased to 49 per cent from the current level of 26 per cent, with full indian management and control. ""the insurance sector is investment starved. several segments of the insurance sector need an expansion,"" he said. while industry executives sought clarity on whether the composite cap meant foreigners would be allowed to own up to 49 per cent through foreign direct investment and foreign portfolio investment, they welcomed the long-pending move. ""it will attract more investors. there are some strategic investors who are very clear about owning 49 percent at least,"" said amitabh chaudhry, ceo of hdfc life, a joint venture between indian mortgage lender housing development finance corp ltd and britain's standard life. ""the fact that the government within six weeks of coming to power has made it clear that that's what they intend to do is a good sign,"" he said, adding that standard life will look at raising its stake from 26 per cent in the joint venture. other foreign insurers including canada's sun life financial inc, prudential plc, nippon life insurance co, italy's generali and dutch insurer aegon nv operate in india through joint ventures with local companies. the country's insurance business was full of promise when it was thrown open to competition in 2000, but has been hobbled by losses, regulatory change, uncertainty and a sharp slowdown in the economy. the government's approval for a proposal to raise the limit to 49 per cent has been kept pending for a long time due to opposition by nationalist politicians, frustrating many overseas investors lured by low penetration rates in india. life insurance penetration in india is about 3.2 per cent of gross domestic product in terms of total premiums underwritten in a year, much lower than more than 10 per cent in japan and nearly 6 per cent in australia. dutch banking and insurance group ing group nv and new york life have quit their indian ventures in recent years, while some other foreign investors were said to be weighing their options. at the end of september 2013, india had 24 life insurers, which accounts for 80 per cent of the sector's business. only 17 of the 24 reported profits in the fiscal year ended march 2013, according to latest data available with the regulator. state-owned life insurance corp of india ltd controls about 70 per cent of the life insurance business.

2014-07-11,"budget 2014: government raises military spending, eases fdi limit in arms industry","new delhi: the government boosted defence spending by 12 per cent in 2014-15 over the previous year in a budget presented on thursday and further opened the domestic weapons industry to foreign investment to help rebuild the military and narrow the gap with china. the country has been the world's top arms buyer for the last three years, trying to replace an ageing soviet-era military with modern weapons as a deterrent to a rising china, with which it fought a war more than half a century ago. finance minister arun jaitley set the military budget at rs 2.29 lakh crore ($38.35 billion) for 2014-15, rs 5,000 crore more than what the previous government agreed in an interim budget earlier this year.defence expenditure for 2013-14 was kept at rs 2.04 lakh crore. ""modernisation of the armed forces is critical to enable them to play their role effectively in the defence of india's strategic interests,"" he said while presenting the budget in parliament on thursday. the bharatiya janata party has long called for a militarily-strong india to counter potential threats from both china and pakistan and said it would speed up the pace of arms purchases for the military, the world's third largest. even at the elevated spending, india's military budget is still less than a third of china's $145 billion expenditure last year estimated by the pentagon in its report to the us congress this month. new delhi worries that china is building roads and other infrastructure along the disputed land border as well as bolstering its naval presence in the indian ocean that it considers its zone of influence. the rise in india's military spending comes as western governments are rushing to visit the new administration in new delhi in the hope of landing multi-billion deals. politicians from france and britain have held talks in new delhi, while the united states, which has built close military ties, is also pushing for faster decisions on arms contracts. foreign investment mr jaitley also increased the foreign investment limit in the domestic defence industry to 49 per cent from 26 per cent, hoping to draw greater interest from its main arms suppliers and help reshape the defence industrial base dominated by state firms. ""companies controlled by foreign governments and foreign private sector are supplying our defence requirements to us at considerable outflow of foreign exchange,"" he said. global arms firms are wooing india in the hope of landing multi-billion dollars and new delhi is aiming to leverage some of that buying power to get transfer of technology and end the overwhelming reliance on imports. the government is in the midst of finalising an estimated $15 billion contract with dassault aviation for the sale of 126 rafale fighter jets. us government officials are separately pushing hard for $2.8 billion in delayed sales of boeing's apache attack and chinook military transport helicopters. the move to raise investment limits for foreign firms in the defence sector drew support. ""fdi limit has been raised from 26 per cent to 49 per cent by the finance minister which is definitely a positive move for the indigenous defence industry. however, the government still wants indian players to maintain control and ownership of the defence joint ventures,"" said nidhi goyal, a director at deloitte in india. mr jaitley, however, did not go as far in liberalising the sector as foreign manufacturers and even the government's own investment promotion department would have liked. india's department of industrial policy and promotion had earlier circulated a discussion document that proposed allowing up to 100 percent foreign direct investment in defence production, two government officials told reuters this month. the note suggested allowing 100 per cent fdi in manufacturing of state-of-the art equipment, one of the officials said. it also recommended a cap of 49 per cent for investments which do not involve transfer technology and a 74 per cent ceiling in such cases where the foreign investor is ready to share technology know-how, the official added. until now, defence has attracted less than $5 million in foreign investment. foreign firms have said they need higher investment caps and greater management control if they are to develop a bigger industrial base in india.

""the combination of improved transport connectivity and simplified, one point collection of taxation will go a long way in implementing the prime minister's vision of 'made in india',"" deutsche bank says.4) urbanization: for large-scale manufacturing, millions of workers need to be absorbed into the urban landscape. however, two-thirds of india's population still lives in villages. in contrast, china is now an urban majority country. deutsche bank says prime minister modi's vision is very enthusiastic about urban growth and the finance minister's budget speech reiterated the idea of building a hundred ""smart cities"".5) labour law reform: india has a plethora of outdated labour laws, some dating from the 1940s, that discourage hiring, deutsche bank says. labour reforms are considered to be politically sensitive, but things may change now. already in rajasthan, a bjp-ruled state, the state government has amended some labour rules, which makes it easier to retrench workers. the idea appears to be that rajasthan's example can then be used to change laws in other states as well as those at the central level, deutsche bank says.googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display(""adslotnativevideo""); });",0.09903830512921424,"pm modi ' ' make india ' push drive investments , create jobs","prime minister narendra modi unveil "" make india "" campaign thursday , aim turn country global manufacturing hub. sales pitch ambitious plan likely made world ' top 3,000 companies ' india inc. likely present occasion.the new government ' push manufacturing could come better time. india needs grow faster increase per capita income create jobs 10 million people , join workforce every year. create jobs , country needs move away services-driven growth model labour-intensive manufacturing-driven growth.

2014-12-11,cabinet clears panel report on insurance bill: top 10 facts,"the cabinet on wednesday cleared a parliamentary committee's recommendations for a composite cap of 49 per cent on foreign investment in insurance in a report tabled in the rajya sabha.the select committee report said that the cap on foreign investment in insurance includes foreign direct investment and foreign portfolio investments.the select committee had in its report recommended 110 amendments to the bill. in order to win congress support, it had adopted 88 amendments by the congress earlier. support of the congress will be critical in the rajya sabha where the nda is in minority.the congress, however, did not dissent against the report adopted by the select committee, unlike the tmc, jdu, cpm and the samajwadi party, who are against increasing the fdi cap.the government is in a rush to introduce the bill for passing on monday, congress sources say the party will clarify its stance once the bill is moved in the upper house.finance minister arun jaitley said in his maiden budget speech in july that the ""composite cap"" in the insurance sector should be increased to 49 per cent from the current level of 26 per cent, with full indian management and control.here are the top 10 takeaways:1) the insurance laws (amendment) bill aims to raise the ceiling on foreign direct investment (fdi) in insurance to 49 per cent from the current 26 per cent limit.2) this marks a reversal from the bjp's earlier stance when it was in opposition. it had then opposed raising the cap on fdi in insurance from 26 per cent. but last year it said it was not against raising the limit on fdi in insurance, but wanted certain caveats and conditions to ""safeguard the interest of the people"".3) the 49 per cent fdi that the bjp-led nda government proposes will be a composite cap - which means that foreign capital can flow in either as direct investment or via the portfolio route, or as a combination of both. so foreign investors can either directly buy equity from the company or can buy shares on the stock market. (how higher insurance fdi limit could benefit you)4) the new measures will allow insurance companies to list on stock exchanges.5) barring public sector insurance companies, all other insurance companies will potentially benefit from a higher fdi cap.6) to allay fears that indian entities may lose control, the bill provides that management must remain with indian companies. and the approval of the foreign investment promotion board (fipb) will be needed on any investment over 26 per cent.7) experts have said that a higher foreign direct investment limit in insurance could result in inflows of rs. 40,000 crore to rs. 60,000 crore over time, and immediate inflows of around rs. 20,000 crore.8) the insurance bill and the sebi bill, which aims at giving more teeth to the market regulator, were cleared by the union cabinet in july, days after finance minister arun jaitley made a promise to do so in his budget speech, noting that ""the insurance sector is investment starved. several segments of insurance sector need expansion"".

2015-01-05,"mani-talk: where is the fdi, modi?","(mani shankar aiyar is a congress mp in the rajya sabha.)the government of india's official, routine mid-year economic analysis has just been published - and a more damning indictment of modi's economic policies would be hard to find. not only has there been little development, all his energies seem to be directed at clandestinely pushing the extremists in his ranks to redouble with vigour their not-so-well-hidden agenda of precipitately pushing the country down the abyss of hindutva.gdp growth is negligible - all of modi's rhetoric has pushed up the rate by no more than an unimpressive 0.6 per cent. even that is the consequence of the last gasp of the previous government whose efforts were just beginning to take effect when the government changed and modi was able to ride the tail wind. gross value added in agriculture and allied activities is actually down - by an entire percentage point; the index of industrial production has gone up by a mere 2.8 per cent; and exports have collapsed from a growth rate of 15.2 per cent to a dreadful 6.7 per cent. the exchange rate vis-a-vis the us dollar is today the lowest ever in the history of our benighted country. the sensex may have soared to heights never before attained but that is principally on account of two factors: one, the modi government having given up its efforts to bring back black money (thus reneging on a core election commitment) and winking at the perennial round-tripping of fresh black money through the mauritius route, thus making speculation on the stock market the main engine of ""growth "" in our country. so, foreign institutional investment (fii) floods in, mostly from mauritius, but it is unreliable ""hot money"" that enters or exits the economy at the press of a computer button. the real mccoy, foreign direct investment (fdi), which is a genuine growth engine, shies away from india because real investors know that modi's claims are bogus and the economy will stagnate under him at 5-6 per cent, no more, perhaps less.the economic analysis tells us that over the six-year period 2005-2011, the average growth rate of gdp was nearly 9 per cent annum. it fell thereafter to below 6 per cent, but jaitley has his work cut out for him to restore the upa-i growth rate. recovery had already begun in the latter phase of upa-ii, but all modi has been able to do is not fall below. there are no signs of the economy accelerating towards the growth rates with which dr. manmohan singh had wowed the world. what then is there to celebrate? inflation, certainly. but that has nothing to do with the exertions of arun jaitley. international oil prices have plunged thanks to a combination of four factors: low to negative growth rates in the developed west; bear sentiment in the new york metals exchange; the steep rise in domestic shale oil and shale gas production in the us that has reduced their petroleum imports to virtually nil; and sanctions against the russian federation for the people of crimea having had the temerity to vote in favour of leaving the ukraine to rejoin russia. plus, of course, opec's decision to keep their oil output at pre-crash levels instead of attempting to keep oil prices higher by cutting back on production. and el nino having at the last minute decided to by-pass india. so, the silver lining has everything to do with the global sun peeking out from behind the black cloud and almost nothing to do with the black cloud backing off from the indian economic horizon.indeed, the mid-year economic analysis confirms that upa-ii was punished for its economic woes just as its herculean efforts to arrest the downslide were coming to fruition. the general index of consumer prices had steeply fallen from its september 2013 high of 11 per cent to below 8 per cent three months later, while food inflation fell over the same period from 14 per cent to below 10 per cent. the trend has continued.while modi has received extended applause for his ""make in india"" slogan, that is all it has remained - a slogan. no one is making in india, not domestic investors, not foreign investors. no one explains this better than the mid-year economic analysis that deserves quotation in full: googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display(""adslotnativevideo""); });""growth in real capital formation was around 15 per cent and private corporate investment surged, east asia-style, over a very short period from 6.5 per cent in 2003-04 to 17.3 per cent in 2007-08, amounting to an increase of nearly 11 percentage points of gdp. investment was based largely on the perception that growth rates of 8.5 per cent would continue indefinitely and banks, especially public sector banks, could lend to private sector investors in infrastructure.""

2015-02-26,opinion: gst could untangle tax issues for e-commerce,"(krupa venkatesh is senior director, indirect taxes, deloitte in india)the debate on goods and services tax or gst is gaining momentum, and hopefully, in the budget session of parliament, the constitutional amendment bill will be passed by both houses. this will be the strongest indication that the gst introduction is well and truly on course. industry has, in no uncertain terms, expressed on more than one occasion that gst is the need of the hour if the desired economic growth and investor confidence is to be achieved.the one sector that will keenly watch how gst will pan out is the e-tailing sector. in recent times, the sector has had its fair share of brushes with the vat authorities. interestingly, these questions seem to have been raised only when online shopping has grown in enormous proportions in india, and every tax authority seems to want a share of the revenue that this sector contributes. the earlier, more docile forms of e-commerce such as online ticketing, music and even software downloads did not evince such extreme reactions from vat authorities. the business models in this sector are not only varied but also complex. one view is that the restriction of fdi in e-commerce that has given rise to such innovative structures.some companies only provide a platform for sellers to register themselves and facilitate a transaction with the buyers. others, in addition to this service, also undertake the responsibility of delivering the goods (fulfilment) to the buyers. a third variant in this sector is a pure play buy-sell model where the goods are sold by the e-commerce company itself. the model that provides the fulfilment services is the one that has attracted the attention of the vat authorities, who are inclined to say that the company, since it deals with the goods, in some form or the other, actually acts as an agent of the seller and is therefore, liable to pay vat. though the anxiety of the vat authorities seem to originate from a 'revenue leakage' perspective, it also seems to be driven by the ease of monitoring one 'commission agent' versus hundreds of dealers. therefore, the basic question that has been raised in this model is: 'who is the seller?' the states, too, seem to be divided on this question. maharashtra has accepted companies providing fulfilment services to be service providers and approved registration for hundreds of dealers in a single warehouse belonging to the e-commerce companies. karnataka, on the other hand, seems to have led the charge against these companies, with many other following suit; some, waiting and watching.whilst the e-tailers continue to grapple with this situation, there is expectation that gst may be the answer to their problems. the constitution amendment bill seeks to define services as anything that does not constitute a supply of goods. in the fulfilment model, there is a supply of service between the e-commerce company and the enlisting seller, but there is a supply of goods between the seller and the customer. the gst will change the point of levy from 'sale' to 'supply', but the fundamental question of 'who is the supplier' may well remain. it is very clear that our current laws do not afford an immediate answer to this problem, but any solution must keep the fdi angle and the tax angle apart from one another.googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display(""adslotnativevideo""); });tax controversies regarding e-commerce are not peculiar to india. earlier this month the eu shifted the place of supply of electronically supplied services to the location of the customer, from the place of the provider. therefore, the vat rate of the customer's state has to be applied, and the supplier will have to obtain a registration in that state, or use the mini one stop shop system, which provides for payment of taxes in multiple states, with a registration in one single state.states protecting their taxing turf and revenues is not new; neither is the feud between brick and mortar sellers and e-tailers. the advent of e-commerce in the usa saw the states taking measures to protect their revenues, and enacting what is referred to as 'amazon laws', thereby paving the passage of the market fairness act in 2013.the gst introduction affords india a golden opportunity to address the problem, and draw upon the experience of other countries. both industry and government must make use of this opportunity to bring in a law that is closer to our times - at least for now!disclaimer: the opinions expressed within this article are the personal opinions of the author. ndtv is not responsible for the accuracy, completeness, suitability, or validity of any information on this article. all information is provided on an as-is basis. the information, facts or opinions appearing in the article do not reflect the views of ndtv and ndtv does not assume any responsibility or liability for the same.",0.06020616883116881,opinion : gst could untangle tax issues e-commerce,"( krupa venkatesh senior director , indirect taxes , deloitte india ) debate goods services tax gst gaining momentum , hopefully , budget session parliament , constitutional amendment bill passed houses. strongest indication gst introduction well truly course. industry , uncertain terms , expressed one occasion gst need hour desired economic growth investor confidence achieved.the one sector keenly watch gst pan e-tailing sector. recent times , sector fair share brushes vat authorities. interestingly , questions seem raised online shopping grown enormous proportions india , every tax authority seems want share revenue sector contributes. earlier , docile forms e-commerce online ticketing , music even software downloads evince extreme reactions vat authorities. business models sector varied also complex. one view restriction fdi e-commerce given rise innovative structures.some companies provide platform sellers register facilitate transaction buyers. others , addition service , also undertake responsibility delivering goods ( fulfilment ) buyers. third variant sector pure play buy-sell model goods sold e-commerce company itself. model provides fulfilment services one attracted attention vat authorities , inclined say company , since deals goods , form , actually acts agent seller therefore , liable pay vat. though anxiety vat authorities seem originate ' revenue leakage ' perspective , also seems driven ease monitoring one ' commission agent ' versus hundreds dealers. therefore , basic question raised model : ' seller?

2015-12-27,"growth rate would improve further in the months to come, says arun jaitley","new delhi: voicing ""great satisfaction"" over performance of the indian economy in ""a year of turmoil and volatility"" globally, finance minister arun jaitley today dismissed grumblings about the economy not having taken off as ""cynicism -- a way of life in india"".looking back at 2015, mr jaitley said india has been the bright spot with growth prospects of 7-7.5 per cent despite global slowdown and adversities, and expressed optimism that the growth rate which is ""quite good"" would improve further in the months to come.india has responded well to the challenge posed by the slowdown in global economy, he said, but acknowledged that ""there are areas (in which) we have to respond faster"".""as the year ends, i look back with a sense of great satisfaction,"" mr jaitley told pti in an interview, during which he underlined that india's fiscal fundamentals are ""extremely sound"".priorities for the new yearoutlining his priorities for the new year, the finance minister said he would continue with structural reforms and the priorities would include goods and services tax (gst), rationalising direct taxes, further easing the system of doing business.""after having done that, i would like to concentrate essentially on three things -- more money for physical infrastructure, more money on social infrastructure and lastly more money on irrigation because that is a neglected sector.""asked about murmurs that the economy has not really taken off, mr jaitley dismissed such grumblings as without merit and said that ""the revenue collections do not go up without the economy taking off"".""cynicism is a way of life in india. you can question any other data but you cannot question the actual rise of revenue and the actual rise of revenue is showing that the economy is doing better,"" he said.asked whether the indian industry was also prone to such cynicism, mr jaitley said, ""well, i think a section of the indian industry has overstretched itself and those who have overstretched themselves see this as a universal problem.""on slowdown in global economybesides global headwinds due to slowdown in china and weakness in commodity markets, india also had to face domestic challenges in form of two continuous weak monsoons and slower private sector investment, making the management of the indian economy a ""great challenge for us,"" mr jaitley said.""private sector investments continued to be slow because the private sector had overstretched itself... they had surplus capacity and demand was slow.""the government responded well to these challenges by stepping up public investment, which has been complemented by 40 per cent rise in fdi and a rebound in consumption, he said.the government has utilised the savings from low oil prices for infrastructure spending, resulting in sectors like highways, rural roads and railways getting a significant step-up of investment. port areas have also been targets of private sector investments, he said.""as a result, despite the global slowdown and adversities, india became the bright spot in the global economy with a growth prospect of 7-7.5 per cent. it is lesser than our targeted 8 per cent. i have no doubt if we have had a normal monsoon, we would have been close to the target.""mr jaitley said the services sector continues to be strong, while ""revival of manufacturing and the iip (index of industrial production) are high points of this year"", which is also reflected in record rise in indirect tax collections.""inflation remains under control, the repo rate (the policy interest rate decided by rbi) has come down this year by 125 basis points. foreign exchange reserves were as good as always. compared to the rest of the global economies, we were far more stable vis-a-vis the dollar,"" mr jaitley said while summing up the macroeconomic trends for 2015.""the year 2015 has been an extremely challenging year as far as economy is concerned, because the world economy has been going through a downturn,"" he said, while adding that imports as well as exports have shrunk due to decline in prices and shrinking of the global trade.""international trade has contracted. so both imports and exports have shrunk. in india context, the shrinkage is more in value (terms) because the prices are low and to some extent in volumes because of the shrinkage of global trade,"" he said.on reform processmr jaitley further said that the government has continued with its reform process including on fronts like fdi norms and ease of doing business, while some of the old taxation issues are being resolved ""one by one"".""the rationalisation of subsidies in a big way has taken place. the methodology of distribution of natural resources has become extremely fair... these are important positives which have emerged as far as our economy is concerned.""on way ahead for the indian economy, mr jaitley said a ""fast moving economy"" will help generate more revenues for investing in physical and social infrastructure as well as irrigation.""i have already been constrained by a 42 per cent (tax) collections going to the states on recommendation of the finance commission. next year, i am constrained by rs 1,02,000 crore extra spending because of the pay commission. so, i have to always keep counting my balance resources,"" he said.on pay panel recommendationson some states requesting deferring the pay panel recommendations due to lack of resources available with them, mr jaitley said a committee of secretaries was already working on the implementation.""the pay commission has already raised the expectations of government servants and defying that expectation is very difficult. i don't grudge the government servants being paid more because after all they are supposed to work harder and work honestly.""asked whether it would be implemented from january 1, mr jaitley said, ""the expert committee will decide (that). the secretaries committee is already working on the matter"".asked whether there have been any disappointment, mr jaitley said, ""i would say fighting a slowdown is a challenge, it can never be a disappointment and we have responded to the challenge"".on goods and services tax, other structural changeson areas where the government needs to respond faster, he said these include various structural changes.""we need to bring our direct taxes at par with what is happening elsewhere in the world... i had hoped that we complete the process of gst this year,"" mr jaitley said, while putting the blame on congress for delaying this reform with its ""plain and simple obstructionism"".""in fact, a national party adopting a disruptionist role and getting a sadistic pleasure in stalling a reform which could add to india's gdp is a disappointment.""it used disruption in order to obstruct and i think it is a very bad precedent for india's parliamentary democracy if this is followed in state legislatures, if this is followed by future opposition parties, i think it would be a bad trend to set.""mr jaitley further said the parliament itself would have to find alternative methods of approving legislation if the congress party does not change its tactics.asked about such alternatives, he said, ""i hope it does not come to a stage where all legislations are passed in a din or you rely on money legislations, you rely more on executive decision making"".stating that some of the legislations have been passed even without discussion, mr jaitley said it was not the ""ideal way how laws should be passed"".on role of rajya sabhaon his comments about the role of rajya sabha, mr jaitley said, ""i have frankly not argued for a fresh look at rajya sabha. rajya sabha is essential and part of india's basic structure. the structure of rajya sabha cannot be altered.""asserting that he would never suggest altering this structure, mr jaitley said, ""i am only on the impact on parliamentary democracy if the indirectly elected house continues to veto a directly elected house"".""... rajya sabha as a house which is supposed to maintain a check and balance, can once in a while disagree with a legislation passed by the lok sabha. it can be referred to a joint session, but every other law they cannot disagree with. it cannot happen too frequently.""and if the indirectly elected house, for political and collateral reasons, vetoes a directly elected house, it does not augur well,"" he said.talking about the system in other countries, jaitley said, ""in britain, they follow a pattern that the upper house can send it (a bill) back once for reconsideration to the lower house and if the lower house, which works on a mandate and which has been elected on a manifesto, second time approves it, the upper house always accepts it.""asked whether that can be followed in india too, he said, ""that could be accepted as a possible precedent.""on rising bad loans of banks, mr jaitley said it was ""a problem inherited from the previous regime"".""we are addressing each one of the sectors - the highways, the infrastructure contracts, the discoms. there is a lot of activity on each and all of these fronts. there is a system of recapitalisation of banks, but the problem is large and therefore, we will have to continue this effort and probably even improve on these efforts,"" he added.",0.07947390572390572,"growth rate would improve months come , says arun jaitley","new delhi : voicing "" great

2016-03-26,india may see strong recovery on consumption boost in fy17: morgan stanley,"mumbai: with both real interest rate in the positive arena and inflation under check, private consumption is set to pick up strongly, leading to a better overall growth, which will be better than the 1998-2002 recovery cycle, says leading wall street brokerage morgan stanley.the report penciled by chetan ahya of morgan stanley india compares both macro as well as the micro parameters during the 1998-2002 cycle and the present downturn cycle that began in 2013, which according to him, are very similar.""we expect private consumption recovery to be stronger than it was in the previous cycle of 1998-02. hence, we expect the overall growth recovery to be better than the past cycle even as it remains slow relative to the 2004-07 period,"" said ahya in a report 'macro indicators chart-book: reminiscent of the 1998-2002 cycle?'generally, real interest rate can be described as nominal interest rate minus the inflation rate.more positively, ahya noted that domestic demand revival in the current cycle by private consumption and public capex is forthcoming, which was absent in the 1998-02 cycle.and accordingly, the report expects private consumption to gather more speed with higher wages to government employees after the 7th pay commission implementation and new job creation.reeling out comparable data between 1998-2002 and the 2013-2016 cycle, ahya notes that in 1998-02, global and domestic factors kept both private as well public capex weak, leading to slow growth and the resultant cad surplus in 25 years at 0.7 per cent of gdp in fy02.he said the economy is already witnessing a trend similar to that of 1998-02 in terms of private capex weakness, with the only two factors that are different in the present cycle -- strong public capex and higher fdi inflows.gross fdi inflows continue to pick up, increasing to an all-time high of dollar 55 billion or 2.7 per cent of gdp as of december 2015, and on the fiscal deficit front, he says on a 12-month trailing basis continues to track below target at 3.4 per cent of gdp as of q3 of the current fiscal against the 3.9 per cent target for fy16.on the macro side, consolidated fiscal deficit is likely to improve to 5.8 per cent of gdp in fy17, (3.5 per cent for the centre and 2.3 per cent for the states) from 5.9 per cent in fy16. but this is a massive improvement from 6.5 per cent from fy15 and 7 per cent in fy14 and 6.9 per cent in fy13, the report said.consolidated deficit came down to 6.5 per cent in fy15 from a peak of 9.9 per cent in fy09, through expenditure control, it added.on pricing parameters, he noted that wpi remains in a deflation mode for the 16th consecutive month in february while non-food wpi too continues to contract with the latest print coming in at 5.4 per cent.this continuing decline in inflation data-print has ensured that the real interest entering the positive territory since january 2014.he, however, noted that present cycle is despite a strong political mandate in the may 2014 hustings that raised quicker recovery hopes.""but, the recovery has all along been frustratingly slow even though the macro stability environment has improved and government policy action too has been moving along the right path,"" ahya said.""in our view, the prolonged weakness in the external environment is a key contributor to the slow pace of recovery. indeed, exports account for 20.5 per cent of gdp and not onlyact as an important source of end demand but also have a bearing on domestic capex growth.""on price stability, he says both the cycles saw a sustained fall in inflation. while cpi inflation declined from 13.2 per cent in 1998 to 4.3 per cent 2002, and fell from a peak of 11.5 per cent in 2013 to 4.9 per cent in 2015.on external stability, the strength of the external balance-sheet improved in both cycles. while cad narrowed from 1.7 per cent of gdp in 1998 to a surplus of 1.4 per cent of gdp in 2002, the same after peaking at 6.5 per cent in 2012, narrowed to 1.3 per cent in december, 2015.but one of the biggest negatives is the high corporate debt in the present cycle. on the contrary, the past cycle saw a considerable build-up of public debt, but the same is declining in the current cycle.external debt is projected to marginally rise to usd 516 billion or 24.7 per cent of the gdp by fy17 from 23.7 per cent or usd 488 billion by fy16. in fy13, it was usd 394 billion or 21.5 per cent, usd 427 billion or 22.9 per cent in fy14, and usd 459 billion or 22.4

delhi: investors must pay taxes on the money they earn in india and the domestic economy is now strong enough to depend on any ""tax-incentivized route"" to attract foreign investments, finance minister arun jaitley said on sunday.he said there was no ""serious apprehension"" of investors shifting base to other tax havens and he sees no depletion in fdi flows due to re-drawing of the decades-old tax treaty with mauritius - the biggest source of foreign investments into india.the amendment would also help check round-tripping of funds and boost domestic consumption, mr jaitley added.after toiling for almost a decade to redraw the tax treaty with mauritius, india will begin imposing capital gains tax on investments in shares through mauritius next april onwards.this has been made possible with amendment to the 34-year old tax treaty between the two countries.as the markets reacted cautiously to india expanding its crackdown on tax treaties to make it harder for investors to use tax havens as a shelter to avoid levies, mr jaitley told pti, ""eventually, markets have to operate on inherent strength of (indian) economy.""stating that the original mauritius treaty created ""a tax-incentivized route"" at a time when india was looking at foreign investments to boost economy, he said the economy has become strong enough and ""now those who earn must pay taxes"".the original treaty, signed almost a decade before india opened up its economy in 1991, has helped channelize more than a third of the $278 billion (nearly rs 19 lakh crore) foreign direct investment india received in the past 15 years.the imposition of taxes has been ""done in a phased manner to avoid shock and i don't expect any depletion to fdi because of this"", the finance minister said.""also, eventually, markets have to operate on inherent strength of economy,"" he added. minister of state for finance jayant sinha said the treaty revision will bring in lot of transparency about mauritius-based entities investing in india.""it will help us dramatically in curbing round-tripping because there are two very important aspects to it. one is the capital gains regime... that will be applicable at the same rate as you would get if you were a domestic resident tax payer in india. so there would be no advantage for anybody coming in through the mauritius route after 2019.""""number two, they will also be able to get a lot more transparency on mauritius companies that will be investing in india through the information exchange protocol that we have also signed,"" he said.asked if the new treaty helps plug the loophole that existed earlier, mr sinha said: ""there was round-tripping of money for certain that was happening. that, of course, will stop because the capital gains benefit will go away. and the information exchange will be far more thorough.""the redrawn mauritius treaty will trigger a similar amendment in india's tax treaty with singapore. mauritius and singapore accounted for $17 billion of the total $29.4 billion india received in fdi during april-december 2015.the indian government last week signed an amendment to its tax agreement with mauritius to get the right to levy capital gains tax on companies routing funds into india through the island nation after march 31, 2017.the short-term capital gains tax will be levied at half the rate prevailing during the first two-year transition period. short-term capital gains are taxed at 15 per cent at present. the full rate will kick in from april 1, 2019.india had in august 1982 signed the treaty with mauritius to eliminate double taxation of income and capital gains to encourage mutual trade and investment.""at a time when economy is picking up and looking at rest of the world, you incentivize investment in certain areas because economy needs those investment at all cost...mauritius was created as a tax-incentivised route and a very large part of fdi came through this route,"" mr jaitley said, adding that no tax on securities transaction and on dividend was created.as the nation of just about 13 lakh people emerged as the biggest source of foreign investment in india, suspicion also grew that a chunk of the funds was not real investment but indians routing cash through the island to avoid domestic taxes, a practice known as round-tripping.""since 1996, we made several steps in order to renegotiate. then in 2005, you extended some of their benefits to singapore. in last one year, mauritius and india had extensive discussion. at one stage, mauritius agreed but then there was a rethink. after a lot of discussion, a very balanced decision has come out,"" mr jaitley said.the minister said people whose capital grows will have to pay tax, but investments up to march 31, 2017 have been kept out of tax ambit for giving ""markets comfort"".stating that the treaty provides for 'grandfathering' till march 2017, mr jaitley said, ""from then till up to two years, 50 per cent of the rate and then from april 2019, 100 per cent of the tax rate (will be applicable).""but this concessional rate of 50 per cent would apply to a mauritius resident

2016-06-02,e-retailers face funding risks due to tighter private equity: report,"mumbai: online retailers are exposed to funding risks as their access to easily available private equity (pe) funds gets tighter, according to a report.as per the report by india ratings and research (ind-ra), the funding through the conventional bank lending is highly unlikely and consequently the e-retailers will need to look for specialised institutional investors which have a high risk appetite to avail of bridge finance.there has been a considerable slowdown in the flow of private equity into online retail companies, with muted deals seen during january-april 2016, the rating agency said.the funding concerns have arisen at a time when e-retailers are undergoing a structural transition in their business model, involving capital expenditure especially after the government's guidelines on fdi in e-commerce, which restricts them from using fdi funds in the inventory based model, the report said.ind-ra believes that due to slowdown in pe funding, competitive pressure from new players in the e-retail business may reduce, resulting in higher entry barriers.this indicates that established players will enjoy the first mover advantages and have limited operating expenses compared to the large capital expenditure that new entrants in the e-commerce space would need.the agency also points out that the funding challenges have come at a stage when the e-retailers are attempting to move out of the deep discounting model to a more sustainable business model, with lower discounts, improving efficiencies and focusing on improving loyalty among customers, it said.as a result the existing players have large planned investments in the value chain like logistics, payment banking, fulfilment centers and omni-channel with a primary focus on improving the active customer base, enhancing customer loyalty and value added services.the transition to a more sustainable business model with lower discounts will result in lower cash burn rate, however the fund requirements to execute investments in the value chain are still sizeable, the agency said.in the event of unsuccessful rounds of pe funding in the future, e-retailers with high cash balances may have to use their cash surplus cautiously to fund growth in the short to medium term.this may jeopardise their organic growth and may result in losing market share to global giants, all of which may further impact the e-retailers valuations, which have recently taken a beating.ind-ra thus believes that higher investments are imperative to maintain the growth momentum and e-retailers will need to find alternate funding sources.(this story has not been edited by ndtv staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)",0.0741509565703114,e-retailers face funding risks due tighter private equity : report,"mumbai : online retailers exposed funding risks access easily available private equity ( pe ) funds gets tighter , according report.as per report india ratings research ( ind-ra ) , funding conventional bank lending highly unlikely consequently e-retailers need look specialised institutional investors high risk appetite avail bridge finance.there considerable slowdown flow private equity online retail companies , muted deals seen january-april 2016 , rating agency said.the funding concerns arisen time e-retailers undergoing structural transition business model , involving capital expenditure especially government ' guidelines fdi e-commerce , restricts using fdi funds inventory based model , report said.ind-ra believes due slowdown pe funding , competitive pressure new players e-retail business may reduce , resulting higher entry barriers.this indicates established players enjoy first mover advantages limited operating expenses compared large capital expenditure new entrants e-commerce space would need.the agency also points funding challenges come stage e-retailers attempting move deep discounting model sustainable business model , lower discounts , improving efficiencies focusing improving loyalty among customers , said.as result existing players large planned investments value chain like logistics , payment banking , fulfilment centers omni-channel primary focus improving active customer base , enhancing customer loyalty value added services.the transition sustainable business model lower discounts result lower cash burn rate , however fund requirements execute investments value chain still sizeable , agency said.in event unsuccessful rounds pe funding future , e-retailers high cash balances may use cash surplus cautiously fund growth short medium term.this may jeopardise organic growth may result losing market share global giants , may impact e-retailers valuations , recently taken beating.ind-ra thus believes higher investments imperative maintain growth momentum e-retailers need find alternate funding sources.( story edited ndtv staff auto-generated syndicated feed. )","{'bjp': 0, 'cong': 0}",0,0

2016-06-23,ratan tata's aviation ambitions now a step closer,"new delhi: officially at least, ratan tata, patriarch of one of india's wealthiest business families, retired in late 2012. in reality, he has been a driving force behind tata's bet on airlines and a rare public campaign to open up the booming aviation sector.the $100 billion tata group conglomerate is a major beneficiary of the decision last week to open up aviation in india, making it easier for start-ups to fly overseas sooner.the decision is no panacea for tata, whose airlines - vistara and airasia india - have had a slow start in a competitive market dominated by indigo, owned by interglobe aviation , and etihad-backed jet airways , both of which opposed the rule change.but it marks a victory for 78-year-old ratan tata, and ends more than two years of airlines lobbying, of twitter rows and of frequent public statements from the usually circumspect steel-to-salt group.""this was a david-and-goliath kind of situation,"" said a source close to tata group. ""there was huge lobbying from the other side.""ultimately, sources familiar with the talks said, it was ratan tata, a trained pilot, who was key to sealing the deal, capitalising on his clout.in a message earlier this year, he called for ""a new open market economy"" and said airlines lobbying against a rule change was ""reminiscent of protectionist and monopolistic pressures by vested interests' entities who seem to fear competition.""a spokesman for tata sons, which promotes the group, denied ratan tata was directly involved, saying he had ""nothing to do with operations or management of either of the airlines"" after his retirement, and that views he expressed were personal.turbulent beginningsnot that either of tata's two airline ventures - a low-cost carrier owned with malaysia's airasia bhd and vistara, a full-service carrier run with singapore airlines - is yet ready to fly overseas. both have had turbulent starts.vistara initially focused on domestic business travellers, but had to reconfigure its aircraft after a year, to replace pricier seats with cheaper ones.airasia underwent a management shake-up earlier this year.vistara's share of india's passenger air market is rising but is still just 2.5 percent after nearly 18 months in business. airasia's share after two years has stagnated at about 2 per cent, government data showed, compared with indigo, which has a 39 per cent share, and jet airways with 19 per cent.but flying overseas is critical. it means higher profits and margins than in india's cut-throat market dominated by low-cost carriers, and vistara and airasia now aim to boost their fleet sizes within a year.a tata sons spokeswoman said making profit can take several years and the group had a ""clear road map"": ""aviation is a long gestation business sector.""the new rules water down a requirement known as 5/20, which barred domestic airlines from flying overseas before being in operation for five years and having 20 aircraft.now they can fly overseas as long as they deploy 20 aircraft or 20 per cent of total capacity in india, whichever is higher. tata sons and the two airlines said they would prefer the rules to be abolished altogether.tata's re-entrytata group, a business empire stretching from jaguar land rover and steel mills in britain to salt pans and india's cheapest car, has a long history in aviation.j. r. d. tata, the group chairman before ratan tata, became india's first qualified pilot in 1929, and set up an airline that was later nationalised as state carrier air india.under ratan tata, the group sought to snap up air india in a privatisation process, later aborted.instead, even as current chairman cyrus mistry has sought to wind up some of tata group's more ambitious projects, ratan tata pulled the group back in with two joint ventures. for his critics, the intervention was too little, too late.in 2013, a year after india liberalised foreign direct investment in aviation, tata returned, first with airasia and then vistara.""india's market has only just started and it could provide growth for global aviation for the next 10 or 15 years,"" said kapil kaul, new delhi-based chief executive of the centre for asia pacific aviation (capa) consultancy.india is the world's fastest-growing aviation market, clocking more than 20 percent growth last year, and capa expects domestic passenger travel to grow to 500 million by 2035 from 70 million in 2015.tata group is moving to capitalise on the win.vistara, which has 11 aircraft, had an original plan to scale up to 20 by june, 2018, but could speed that up.""we do not rule out accelerating the deliveries or procuring more aircraft from leasing firms, manufacturers or, for that matter, from our parent singapore airlines also,"" vistara ceo phee teik yeoh said in response to a query.yeoh said the company was reviewing its international plans.airasia is in the process of ramping up its aircraft to 20 from six to meet the criteria, india ceo amar abrol said, adding that the airline lobbied hard for the removal of the 5/20 rule. © thomson reuters 2016(except for the headline, this story has not been edited by ndtv staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)",0.0944592988710636,ratan tata ' aviation ambitions step closer,"new delhi : officially least , ratan tata , patriarch one india ' wealthiest business families , retired late 2012. reality , driving force behind tata ' bet airlines rare public campaign open booming aviation sector.the $ 100 billion tata group conglomerate major beneficiary decision last week open aviation india , making easier start-ups fly overseas sooner.the decision panacea tata , whose airlines - vistara airasia india - slow start competitive market dominated indigo , owned interglobe aviation , etihad-backed jet airways , opposed rule change.but marks victory 78-year-old ratan tata , ends two years airlines lobbying , twitter rows frequent public statements usually circumspect steel-to-salt group.

2016-07-01,"salary hikes for government employees is smart, calculated move"," it is a little surprising to note the muted response to the announcement that the 7th pay commission's recommendations will be fully implemented with effect from january 1, 2016. some white collar workers have even threatened a strike claiming that the pay hike announced is meagre. according to the professional agitators, whereas the lowest minimum pay should have been raised to rs 23,500 per month from the existing rs 7,000, it has been increased to ""just"" rs 18,000. however, it can safely be said that once the new pay packet actually comes in next month, the ardour for protest will lessen considerably.although there are many sceptics who will contend that the infusion of approximately rs one lakh crore into the economy by way of this bonanza will result in a demand push and consequent inflationary pressure, the government could not have avoided implementing the award by a statutory body. regardless of the inevitable demand push, the question is whether that is necessarily a bad thing? arguably the economy is growing at an impressive 7.6 per cent per annum. but it is also apparent that consumer demand remains sluggish and new jobs are not being created. this has resulted in the feeling that the modi government's well-intentioned schemes have fallen short of delivery and failed to match the expectations generated by the prime minister's feisty election promises.to combat the sullen mood about the slow progress of economic indicators, it was essentially to inject some adrenalin into the system. so, even at the cost of pushing up inflation, the government had to take a calculated risk and announce implementation of the pay commission recommendations. further, it clearly does not want to delay the release of the backlog. as the new salary scales will be implemented from january, the backlog will not be as large as it has been in the past. further, liquidity will thus flow quickly into the system giving it the necessary spurt.the government has been helped in pursuing this ambitious strategy primarily because finance minister arun jaitley's deft management of the economy has restricted fiscal deficit to 4.7 per cent, tantalisingly close to the projected figure, an extraordinary achievement by contemporary standards. a word of praise is also due to the much-maligned outgoing rbi governor raghuram rajan and his dogged refusal to lower interest rates, thereby keeping inflation in check till now. therefore, when inflation starts mounting after disbursement of the pay commission's bonanza, it will hopefully still remain under control and not jump to double digits.the indian middle class has been straining at the leash for the government's tight money policy to ease so that it can go for enhanced purchases both of immovable assets and consumer durables. the pathetic state of india's real estate sector is already apparent to all. at one end, there is oversupply in certain regions such as delhi-ncr, while high prices have kept buyers away in almost all regions. further, both buyers and sellers are yet to come to grips with the modi government's crackdown on black money; they are still bewildered by how to pay the entire sum involved in real estate purchases in ""white"". the government's intentions are laudable, but needs backing with greater liquidity in the market and more purchasing power in the hands of buyers. therefore the implementation of the pay commission report has come at a most appropriate time.additionally, the liberalisation of the model shops and establishments act to allow retail business enterprises like restaurants and cinema halls to stay open 24 hours if so desired by their owners is a bold and welcome measure. it ties up with greater spending power in the hands of consumers. longer shopping hours are expected to lead to greater employment in shops and malls. today, even tier 3 cities boast of well-equipped shopping malls, and job growth is likely in these centres too, especially if the monsoon delivers as predicted.generally speaking, private sector employees earn more than their public sector counterparts post-to-post, though perques such as subsidised housing are benefits which only government staff get. over the years, the gap between salaries in the private sector and the public sector has been narrowing. in order to retain talent in its establishments, the government has been compelled to enhance salaries of its non-core employees such as teachers. with the advent of well-heeled private universities, for example, teachers who had no option other than to work on ugc scales now have a choice of opting for better-paying private teaching jobs. the drain from government-run healthcare institutions to private hospitals is also well known. the 7th pay commission has made one more effort at removing this anomaly so that the migration from specialised government hospitals like aiims can be stalled.these two examples are significant because in an increasingly market-driven economy, it is the social sector which will remain the government's primary responsibility. consequently, the need for quality personnel becomes an imperative. and when the government competes in the open market to recruit staff for essential services like healthcare and higher education, it will need to pay better salaries that at least match, if not exceed, private sector pay.as the government's emphasis shifts to spending more on the social sector, it will need to balance this with job cuts in non-essential sectors. retrenching staff is a touchy issue in india especially because the country lacks an adequate social security net. the modi government has introduced new insurance-based schemes that will gradually emerge as substitutes to a full-blown social security net. with over 50 lakh direct employees and a staggering 58 lakh pensioners, the government has to delicately balance the twin demands of keeping its existing staff and future recruits happy, while cutting down on its salary budget.even as the regime tries to keep its employee-related expenses under control, it can only hope that the pay commission bonanza will spur its staff to go for additional spending. the real estate sector, along with automobiles, electronic goods and financial markets, will be among those expecting to get a slice of the projected additional spending. it is widely hoped that the pay commission pay-outs will act as the trigger to shake the retail economy out of somnolence.but the bigger part of government spending must be earmarked for the infrastructure sector and its components like cement and steel. these sectors too deserve incentives to combat the dumping of cheap chinese products. the government is obviously hoping that more fdi will flow into the market with the opening up of major sectors like defence. but that cannot be assumed as foreign investors would wait and watch the impact of additional purchasing power in people's hands before committing more funds into indian industry. but for the first time, a pay commission report has been implemented in tandem with several measures aimed at giving a huge push to the economy. this composite approach seems sure to succeed in the coming months.(dr. chandan mitra

2016-08-09,door to foreign investors only half-open in india," once again, india is in danger of sabotaging its own efforts to raise foreign investment to china-like levels. the latest salvo in this undeclared, self-defeating war is the government's reported decision to block tata sons from paying what arbitrators say the company owes to a former partner, the japanese company ntt docomo.the decision is particularly odd because, under prime minister narendra modi, the indian government has highlighted its outreach to foreign investors. modi has called india ""the most open economy in the world"" when it comes to inward investment. he's boasted about the recent dramatic increase in fdi -- and justified his frequent and controversial international jaunts as efforts to attract more.it's an uphill battle. in spite of india's growth rate -- highest among the world's large economies -- political risks continue to deter many investors. the administration before modi's incensed many of them by retrospectively changing tax law in order to win a dispute with vodafone, the anglo-dutch telecommunications company. while senior officials in modi's cabinet have promised not to repeat such mistakes, the vodafone case drags on, as do other such disputes.now, new flashpoints have emerged. in the tata-docomo deal, the indian company agreed to buy back shares in its joint venture with docomo if certain conditions weren't met. the government first blocked those purchases, wrongly invoking a regulation meant to prevent equity investments from flowing into india disguised as debt. then, after docomo sought international arbitration and won $1.17 billion in compensation, the government has sought to prevent even that payment.the effort is not only a blow to india's image. if the government doesn't relent, docomo could well go after tata sons' assets in the rest of the world. there's a very real possibility that jaguar land rover or tata steel's european operations -- including steel mills in britain -- could fall under the control of the company's erstwhile japanese partner. (in a statement, tata sons disputed this characterization. ""these companies are not party to the arbitration proceedings, and no award has been issued against them,"" it said. ""it follows that the award cannot be enforced against those companies."" tata also said that its arguments haven't yet been heard in court. ""tata sons has from the outset underlined its commitment to honoring its contractual obligations to docomo, and has taken every possible step keeping in mind the interests of all stakeholders and in accordance with indian law,"" it said.) such fears are unlikely to suggest to most investors that india is the open and welcoming environment that modi claims it is.unfortunately, if you thought the government couldn't make things even harder for itself, you'd be wrong. docomo's arbitration victory is only the latest in a series of such awards won by investors who have argued they were defrauded or had their assets expropriated by the indian government. many of these cases have been brought under bilateral investment treaties (bits) signed between india and countries around the world. tax disputes involving vodafone and cairn energy are perhaps the most prominent; the latter is asking, in an ongoing arbitration, for $5.6 billion in compensation from the indian government. for foreign investors, the possibility of arbitration -- guaranteed by treaty -- is at least some small hedge against the arbitrary behavior in which indian government agencies often engage.now the government has stunned investors by serving notice to 57 countries demanding that existing bits be terminated, and new ones signed.the new treaties will be based on a draft approved last year, which significantly weakens investor protections. tax disputes -- such as those involving vodafone and cairn -- will be kept out of the new treaties entirely. that means foreign investors will lose what was, in effect, their main protection against capricious indian tax collectors.even worse, investors will now have to exhaust all local remedies before going to international arbitration. given that the indian government automatically appeals cases that go against it, this means that a case would have to work its way through the entire indian legal system, from sessions to supreme court, before arbitrators could get a crack at it. and remember, this is the indian judicial system: it works so slowly, and is so overburdened, that india's chief justice actually broke down in tears while talking about it recently. for investors, years -- perhaps decades -- of delay is pretty much the same as losing money, perhaps worse.often in india, the government's left hand doesn't know what its right is doing. hopefully, that's what's happening here. while modi's reaching out to foreign investors, government agencies are making it impossible for them to commit the kind of money that india's economy desperately needs. the promise of good returns isn't enough. india also has to assure investors of transparent and good-faith dispute resolution. otherwise they'll be perfectly justified in taking that money elsewhere.© 2016 bloomberg l.p.(except for the headline, this story has not been edited by ndtv staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)",0.07181932566078908,door foreign investors half-open india,", india danger sabotaging efforts raise foreign investment china-like levels. latest salvo undeclared , self-defeating war government ' reported decision block tata sons paying arbitrators say company owes former partner , japanese company ntt docomo.the decision particularly odd , prime minister narendra modi , indian government highlighted outreach foreign investors. modi called india "" open economy world "" comes inward investment.

2016-10-15,"rosneft, partners buy essar oil for $13 billion in largest fdi deal","panaji: in the largest inflow of foreign direct investment, russia's state-controlled oil giant rosneft and its partners today took over india's second biggest private oil firm essar oil in an all-cash deal valued at about $13 billion.rosneft bought a 49 per cent stake in essar oil's refinery, port and petrol pumps, while netherlands-based trafigura group pte, one of the world's biggest commodity trading companies, and russian investment fund united capital partners split another 49 per cent equity equally.the remaining 2 per cent will be held by minority shareholders after delisting of essar oil.the deal has an enterprise value of close to $12.9 billion - $10.9 billion being for a 20 million tons a year refinery in gujarat and over 2,700 petrol pumps and another $2 billion for vadinar port in gujarat. the deal factors in essar oil's debt of about $4.5 billion and about $2 billion debt with the port company.also, the near $3 billion dues to iran for past oil purchases will continue to be on essar oil books.trafigura, which has been funded by russian bank, may sell its stake to rosneft at a later date.""we would be utilising significant portion of the deal proceeds in debt reduction. group debt will reduce by about 50 per cent,"" said prashant ruia, director, essar group.essar group, one of india's largest and most indebted conglomerates, would trim its about rs 88,000 crore (over $13 billion) debt by half and ward off creditor pressure.the 49 per cent stake trafigura and ucp are picking will be split between the two in 49:49 ratio while essar group will hold the remaining 2 per cent.mr ruia said the equity value of the deal is ""on or about essar oil's delisting price of $5.8 billion"".of the $12.9 billion value, $6.5 billion is for the debt with essar oil and port company. another $0.5 billion is for working capital, leaving $5.9 of equity value which is equal to the delisting price of essar oil.mr ruia said as per sebi order the shareholders of essar oil will be paid if the final equity value of the deal with rosneft is higher than the delisting price.""we will get to know of that when the deal closes in first quarter of 2017,"" he said.the acquisition is the biggest in india and largest outbound deal for russia. the all cash deal is expected to close in first quarter of 2017.the deal was announced as prime minister narendra modi met russian president vladimir putin during a meeting here of the leaders of the brics countries (brazil, russia, india, china and south africa).mr ruia said rosneft will continue to use essar brand for the retail operations. ""we have signed a branding agreement under which retail outlets will continue to use essar brand because it is a very strong brand.""""we are not exiting oil and gas business. we continue to own and operate the stanlow refinery in uk which is a 12 million tons refinery and has 12-13 per cent market share.also, the upstream exploration and production business is not part of the deal,"" he said.he said two agreements were signed today for the sale.""the first sale and purchase agreement envisages the sale of 49 per cent to petrol complex pte ltd (a subsidiary of pjsc rosneft oil company); the second envisages the sale of the remaining 49 per cent to kesani enterprises company limited (owned by a consortium led by trafigura and united capital partners) at an enterprise valuation of rs 72,800 crore ($10.9 billion).""an additional rs 13,300 crore ($2 billion) will be paid for the acquisition of vadinar port, which has world-class storage and import/export facilities,"" mr ruia said.as per the deal, essar energy holdings ltd and oil bidco (mauritius) ltd -- which control essar oil signed separate agreements for the 98 per cent stake sale.russia's vtb bank pjsc will lend essar $3.9 billion to restructure debt, said andrey kostin, vtb ceo. rosneft itself will pay about $3.5 billion for the essar deal, mr ruia said.""we plan to utilise proceeds from the stake sale to deleverage the group and pave the way for strategic consolidation and growth in other businesses,"" mr ruia said.essar oil, part of a steel-to-ports conglomerate controlled by the billionaire ruia brothers, operates a 405,000-barrels-a-day refinery at vadinar in gujarat. the refining complex also has a captive power plant as well as a port and terminal facilities.the deal is the single largest foreign investment in the indian refining sector and will strengthen the ties between the world's largest oil producer and the world's fastest growing fuel consumer.""the all-cash deal encompasses essar oil's 20 million tonne refinery in gujarat and its pan-india retail outlets,"" mr ruia said.the deal includes the refinery as well as the vadinar port and more than 2,700 retail gas stations. the initial transaction will not include a power plant serving the refinery, which could be transferred later after getting necessary approvals.""the closing of the transaction is conditional upon receiving requisite regulatory approvals and other customary conditions. we expect to obtain the relevant approvals before the end of this year,"" mr ruia said.googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display(""adslotnativevideo""); });while the refining sector is delicensed with 100 per fdi allowed, the deal will not as such need any major regulatory approval in india. it will only need an approval by the competition commission of india.the 20 million tonne oil refinery in vadinar accounts for 9 per cent of india's total refining output and is supported by a 1,010 mw captive power plant, mr ruia said.""the additional rs 13,300 crore that the new stakeholders have agreed to pay is for the 58 million tonne deep draft port in vadinar that helps in importing crude and exporting finished products,"" he said.initially, ruias wanted to shed only 49 per cent in favour of rosneft but the $3.2 billion they would have got from the russian company wasn't enough to pay off the $4.5 billion debt on the company's books.a larger 74 per cent stake was offered to rosneft but that idea was dropped as the russian company faces us sanctions and by a virtue of its majority stake essar oil too would have come on that list.at this stage, trafigura was roped in and offered 24 per cent stake. trafigura, which has close ties to rosneft, was to finance its acquisition by taking loan from russia's vtb capital, part of state-controlled bank vtb.the deal includes the vadinar refinery as well as the vadinar port and more than 2,700 petrol pumps. a power plant serving the refinery as well as company's coal-bed methane (cbm) blocks are not included in the deal.as part of the deal, rosneft-trafigura will also take over the debt of essar oil and the port and terminal company.mr ruia said vtb capital has played a major role in the transaction, which has been structured in such a way that it does not invite us sanctions on essar oil.last year, us treasury's office of foreign assets control (ofac) had issued a crimea sanctions advisory, adding rosneft and its subsidiaries to its sectoral sanctions identifications list in retaliation for the russian's invasion of eastern ukraine.entities on this list are subject to economic and trade sanctions on grounds that they pose a risk to us national security and are in violation of us foreign policy objectives.rosneft had in july last year signed a non-binding agreement to buy a 49 per cent stake in essar oil.this was followed by december 2015 deal wherein rosneft was to supply vadinar refinery with 200,000 barrels of crude per day (10 million tons a year) for 10 years.sources said trafigura may at a later stage transfer its stake to rosneft.trafigura handles most of the crude exported by rosneft. this has propelled trafigura to being the world's second-biggest independent oil trader, handling more than 4 million barrels a day.russia is seeking to expand its energy ties in asia amid tensions with the west sparked by moscow's annexation of crimea in 2014.rosneft, the world's largest listed oil producer by output, is looking at south asia for downstream investments as it sees the region as becoming a fast-growing market for its oil.india -- which depends on imports for about 80 per cent of its needs -- is set to taking over from china as the main driver of global oil demand growth this year. india is the world's third-largest oil consumer, behind china and the us.rosneft is reportedly discussing investing $13 billion in a new refinery project in indonesia with pertamina, the country's state-controlled oil and gas company.russian oil producers have been relatively sheltered from the collapse in crude prices by the decline of the rouble, which has helped them to reduce costs. a progressive taxation system under which the russian government has absorbed most of the decline in oil prices has also boosted the producers.russia has signed huge deals to deliver oil and gas to china and allowed chinese companies to buy stakes in large energy projects.indian companies have also snapped up stakes in production assets in siberian fields. ongc, oil india and indian oil are investing $5.5 billion to buy stakes in rosneft's vankor and taas-yuryakh fields.chinese and indian state firms have expressed an interest in taking a stake in rosneft, as the russian state plans to sell 19.5 per cent of the company this year. the state would retain control of the company, in which bp of uk already has a near 20 per cent stake.russia ranked 20th among countries with a total investment of just about $1.2 billion in india in the last 16 years. mauritius gave nearly $96 billion, while singapore and the uk have invested $46 billion and $23 billion each in india.oil sector

2017-01-14,modi's vibrant gujarat tamasha is a giant flopshow," the americans have the right word for it - razzmatazz, the most appropriate word to describe the vibrant gujarat summits, started by chief minister modi in the year after the post-godhra pogrom and now into its eighth edition - long enough to evaluate whether this is serious business or just razzmatazz.given the announcements made at these summits of humongous investments by almost every big name in indian business and a host of foreign giants, gujarat's gsdp (gross state domestic product) should surely have been soaring. then, why has it been steadily declining? back in 2010-11, the gsdp rate at current prices stood at 20.19%. in every subsequent year, or so say official gujarat government records, that rate has fallen first to 17.6%, then slipped to 13.3%, further dropped off to 11%, and now slid to 10% (2015-16). curious. just as y-on-y (that is, year-on-year, for the uninitiated), vibrant gujarat summits announce larger and larger numbers of mous and higher and higher amounts of promised investment, actual investments tumble and carry down with them the gsdp growth, whether measured at current prices (nominal growth) or at constant prices (real growth)indeed, in real terms, the slide is even more dramatic. real gsdp growth stood at 10.8% in 2012-13, slipped to 8.3% the following year, slid thereafter to 7.7%, and has now crashed to 6.7% (2015-16). modi should really take his place in the highest echelon of 21st century economists for having irrefutably demonstrated that higher and higher mous lead to lower and lower growth rates! amartya sen, please stand aside. here comes the next nobel prize winner for economics.what is even more fascinating is the inverse relationship between promised mou investments and actual on-the-ground industrial investment approvals according to figures released by gujarat's industries commissioner. if one adds up the announcements made over the past seven summits, the pledges come to a whopping rs 84.55 lakh crore. when, however, actual investment approvals are counted, it appears that over the period of the lasts seven summits (1/8/83 to 31/08/16), investment approvals stand at just a whisper above 10% of the promises made: a mere rs 9.51 lakh crore! (can you hear modi singing in the distance: kya hua tera wada, woh kasam, woh irada?)and that is why, delhi and maharashtra, without any summits, vibrant or otherwise, have attracted 29.20% and 20.16% respectively of foreign direct investment over the first two years of the modi regime, while poor gujarat, notwithstanding its glittering vibrant gujarat summits, stagnated at a puny 5.13% - having attracted no more than $2,682 million fdi, just about enough to cover the costs of their bi-annual tamasha!it was announced in 2009, eight years ago, that 31 mous committing investment of the order of rs 2.12 lakh crore had been concluded. eight years later, according to papers released to the press at the official congress party briefing on 10 january 2017, only one of these projects is off the ground. the biggest non-starter is gujarat state electricity corporation and gujarat state petroleum corporation (gspc), who jointly announced they would be investing rs 26,600 crore in the power sector. gspc is now wallowing in over rs 20,000 crore unpaid loans with ongc being urged to take over the company, despite its having virtually no assets and a huge debt overhang. little wonder then that there has been little or no investment momentum shown by either partner.private sector announcements have fared no better. while adani had dangled rs 12,000 crore before the summit for power plants at dhanduka and dahegam, virtually no action has been taken at either location. the same is the fate of investment pledges of over rs 10,000 crore each made by such towering indian industrial houses as torrent, opg, and shapoorji, as with those of over rs 5,000 crore made by avantha, canasia, gmr, jsw energy, rachana, responsive and shyam. at rs 3,000 crore, we have videocon and at rs 1,500 crore, reliance cementation figures. two, antai balaji and avinash steel, have just disappeared - even from their web-sites! googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display(""adslotnativevideo""); });why? principally because gujarat is a power-surplus state and there are no buyers! this was well-known even in 2009. then why these empty announcements? for three reasons - perhaps. first, because power is sexy and the sector looked good on modi's cv. second, because big promises give a big boost in the stock market to those who make big news. third, because it is an easy way of acquiring government land at throw-away prices. the last point is well-illustrated by the case of sg transstadia, with whom an mou was signed just two years after the company was set up (as revealed by the congress spokesman at his open press briefing on 10 january 2017). the land they coveted was priced at rs 144.5 crore by the valuation committee. this was then leased to transstadia by the government of gujarat at a rent of a mere rs 4 lakh per annum (for 35 years!) whereas, at the usual rent of 15% of valuation, the annual rent should have amounted to rs 21.67 crore. similarly, where the government of gujarat permitted indigold to sell to allumina land allotted to the former, the supreme court has set aside the government order and asked it to deposit compensation of rs 3.15 crore. readers are, therefore, advised to arm themselves with jars full of salt as the current summit announces that mous of over rs 20 lakh crore have already been signed by the second day and the final figure is expected to touch rs 30 lakh crore! if there were some system of substantial earnest money deposits for making such announcements (say, 10% of the announcement - not refundable - before signing such mous), there would be a sharp drop in such fake news to go by past experience.but this won't happen - because modi has made a career out of following the example of goebbels: ""arguments must be crude, clear and forcible, and appeal to the emotions and instincts, not the intellect"". what a perfect description of modi's oratory! the influence of mussolini on the rss might also be recalled in this context. at page 100 of his recent biography, the untold vajpayee, ullekh n.p. cites an article in the economic and political weekly of 22 january 2000 by an italian scholar, marzia casolari, saying that as a consequence of the rss leader, bs moonje, having established contact with benito mussolini: ""hindu nationalists looked at the political reality of fascist italy and subsequently nazi germany as a source of inspiration...if it is true that hindu society elaborated its own patterns of militarization, it is equally true that a most relevant result of fascist influence was the transmission of a more functional organization and a stronger political character to the already existing organizations of political hinduism."" a useful lesson to bear in mind as we evaluate modi's brain-child, the vibrant gujarat summits. after all, modi remains an rss pracharak, ready at any time, as he himself boasts, to pick up his jhola and leave. what a lovely prospect!(mani shankar aiyar is former congress mp, lok sabha and rajya sabha.)disclaimer: the opinions expressed within this article are the personal opinions of the author. the facts and opinions appearing in the article do not reflect the views of ndtv and ndtv does not assume any responsibility or liability for the same.",0.07764380681047346,modi ' vibrant gujarat tamasha giant flopshow,"americans right word - razzmatazz , appropriate word describe vibrant gujarat summits , started chief minister modi year post-godhra pogrom eighth edition - long enough evaluate whether serious business razzmatazz.given announcements made summits humongous investments almost every big name indian business host foreign giants , gujarat ' gsdp ( gross state domestic product ) surely soaring. , steadily declining ?

2017-06-28,"government has our support on gst, war on fdi"," as we approach the monsoon session of parliament, the trinamool congress remains optimistic that the goods and services tax constitutional amendment will be passed this time. the gst reform has been one of the consistent demands of trinamool for several years, of course with due protection for state governments and small businessmen. while we will support the move towards gst, in the coming session, we are equally vehemently going to announce our opposition to the new fdi limits announced by the government in a slew of sectors.there is no basic difference in the character and economic outlook of the bjp and the congress. the positive side to this has been that both the upa and nda governments have worked towards gst, though both the bjp and the congress have opportunistically sabotaged gst while in opposition. the negative side to this consistency is the policy on fdi, which is aimed at winning praise and thumps on the back from bigwigs in the west and ignoring genuine job-creation challenges in india.in june, the bjp-led government enhanced fdi limits in domestic airlines from 49 to 100 per cent, in existing airports from 74 to 100 per cent without any need to seek permission from the foreign investment promotion board or fipb, in food retail from zero to 100 per cent, in food processing up to 100 per cent, in private security agencies from 49 to 74 per cent (i wonder what great technology and know-how is needed to provide security guards?), in existing pharmaceutical companies up to 74 per cent through the automatic route (again without need for a reference to the fipb).these are serious and far-reaching changes that need to be discussed in parliament and across the country. if the two food sector-related fdi caps are considered, it is clear that a vast segment of the farm-to-fork supply chain can now be entirely owned by foreign companies. their deep reserves will crowd out indian investment, entrepreneurship and job creation opportunities, particularly in the small and medium sector. a similar disservice has also been done in the case of single-brand retail, where the 30 per cent local sourcing requirement has been relaxed for eight years (earlier it was three years).the retail chapter is particularly sordid. in 2009, the parliamentary standing committee on commerce had submitted a report urging that majority fdi in retail not be permitted. in september 2012, the upa government permitted 51 per cent fdi in multi-brand retail and 100 per cent in single-brand retail. many parties, including the bjp, protested.for trinamool, this was the final assault by the upa's economic managers. six of my party colleagues resigned as ministers on september 21, 2011, and trinamool withdrew from the upa and became part of the opposition. in november 2012, the government was forced to agree to a voting discussion in parliament on the fdi in retail issue.the upa government had argued that a vote had never been conducted on an executive decision. after pointing out precedents, the opposition forced a voting discussion under rule 184 in the lok sabha and rule 167 in the rajya sabha. this time too, that option remains for us, though the government and the actors have changed. the script, of slyly pushing through multinational corporation interests, is still the same. changes in fdi regulations can be made only by the reserve bank of india (rbi), in turn changing regulations in the foreign exchange management act (fema) of 1999. from time to time, the rbi issues notifications making such changes or amending the regulations. section 48 of fema mandates that all such changes be laid on the floor of the house; such changes are called ""subordinate legislations"" as per the constitution of india.rule 234 of the lok sabha rules has laid down that every regulation made under any legislation - and this includes ""subordinate legislations"" - should be placed on the floor of the house, if so required by the legislation, as soon as it is made. so far every regulation and amendment made by the rbi under fema has been placed before parliament.under rule 235 of the lok sabha any member can seek an amendment to the regulation and ask for a vote. this is the right of the house. as such a vote can be demanded under rule 235. this too remains a theoretical option.my interest in pointing out all this is that the bjp-led government, like its predecessor, is being dishonest when it claims the executive has the right and the authority to ram through all sorts of proposals and bypass parliament. our democratic system and our constitution give parliament the right to question, to amend, to express its displeasure and at the very least to debate executive decisions, especially if they have long-term and fundamental socio-economic implications.the fdi giveaways that the nda government has done in the past few days, aimed at pleasing its friends abroad and constituency in big business, will be taken up strongly by trinamool in parliament. this is a matter of principle for us. we will not give up without teaching the government a lesson.derek o'brien is leader, parliamentary party trinamool congress (rs), and chief national spokesperson of the party.disclaimer: the opinions expressed within this article are the personal opinions of the author. the facts and opinions appearing in the article do not reflect the views of ndtv and ndtv does not assume any responsibility or liability for the same.",0.02693851783137498,"government support gst , war fdi","approach monsoon session parliament , trinamool congress remains optimistic goods services tax constitutional amendment passed time. gst reform one consistent demands trinamool several years , course due protection state governments small businessmen. support move towards gst , coming session , equally vehemently going announce opposition new fdi limits announced government slew sectors.there basic difference character economic outlook bjp congress. positive side upa nda governments worked towards gst , though bjp congress opportunistically sabotaged gst opposition. negative side consistency policy fdi , aimed winning praise thumps back bigwigs west ignoring genuine job-creation challenges india.in june , bjp-led government enhanced fdi limits domestic airlines 49 100 per cent , existing airports 74 100 per cent without need seek permission foreign investment promotion board fipb , food retail zero 100 per cent , food processing 100 per cent , private security agencies 49 74 per cent ( wonder great technology know-how needed provide security guards ? ) , existing pharmaceutical companies 74 per cent automatic route ( without need reference fipb ) .these serious far-reaching changes need discussed parliament across country. two food sector-related fdi caps considered , clear vast segment farm-to-fork supply chain entirely owned foreign companies. deep reserves crowd indian investment , entrepreneurship job creation opportunities , particularly small medium sector. similar disservice also done case single-brand retail , 30 per cent local sourcing requirement relaxed eight years ( earlier three years ) .the retail chapter particularly sordid. 2009 , parliamentary standing committee commerce submitted report urging majority fdi retail permitted. september 2012 , upa government permitted 51 per cent fdi multi-brand retail 100 per cent single-brand retail. many parties , including bjp , protested.for trinamool , final assault upa ' economic managers. six party colleagues resigned ministers september 21 , 2011 , trinamool withdrew upa became part opposition. november 2012 , government forced agree voting discussion parliament fdi retail issue.the upa government argued vote never conducted executive decision. pointing precedents , opposition forced voting discussion rule 184 lok sabha rule 167 rajya sabha. time , option remains us , though government actors changed. script , slyly pushing multinational corporation interests , still same. changes fdi regulations made reserve bank india ( rbi ) , turn changing regulations foreign exchange management act ( fema ) 1999. time time , rbi issues notifications making changes amending regulations. section 48 fema mandates changes laid floor house ;

2017-07-15,india's challenge to deal with investor disputes," a mega-regional trade agreement will be at the heart of the agenda when 16 countries meet at hyderabad, telangana in the coming week. this agreement is called regional comprehensive economic partnership (rcep), which aims to improve trade between these nations. it also goes beyond mere trade, and aspires to be an investment treaty. a controversial chapter on investment is part of the 23 and more chapters envisioned for the rcep.the rcep countries cover 45 per cent of the world population and more than $21 trillion combined gdp. among the nations in rcep, 10 are asean countries along with china, india, australia, japan, south korea and new zealand.the meeting is important for the host india as foreign direct investment (fdi) - which has been one of government's main slogans - isn't increasing as per its hopes. in the first three months of current year (january-march 2017), fdi fell by 28 per cent. what is more worrying is the increasing number of investor arbitration suits filed by companies against india in recent past. legal researcher and trade policy expert shalini bhutani has calculated that in last six years, investment arbitration suits of at least $7,000 million have been filed against the central and state governments.ms bhutani explains, ""if governments bring out a law or administrative order to address people's concerns, ecological issues or any other domestic need and that measure affects the business or revenue of any investor - whether company or investment agency of another country, it files arbitration suits against the host government. many times the investors have raised very hefty claims as damages"".ms bhutani cites the recent arbitration notice filed by the investment authority of ras al-khaimah in december 2016, which is a member of united arab emirates (uae). ras al-khaimah had invested in bauxite mining near the port city of vishakhapatnam, but when the mining approval got cancelled in 2016 because of an order by the state government, the ras al-khaimah investment agency (rakia) filed a suit of $44.71 million against the central government and the government of andhra pradesh. this claim was made possible by a provision in the uae-india bilateral investment treaty (bit).vedanta group which is registered in uk filed an arbitration suit of $3billion in 2016 and devas multimedia filed a compensation case of $1 billion just two years ago. likewise, more than a dozen companies have filed cases of billions of dollars against the central and state government. these international investment arbitrations were commenced using different bits.according to present bits in a bilateral investment dispute, parties have to file the name of their arbitrators within 60 days. three arbitrators are appointed, one from each side and one independent arbitrator. the decision is legally binding, often without any appeal. this totally bypasses the judicial system of the host country. in turn, it creates big business for the international arbitration industry. trade experts say that india doesn't have any strong safeguards to avoid these arbitration suits. though, they do point to the provisions of india's new model bit (2015) that insists on exhaustion of local remedies, before investors can seek such arbitration. in the rcep meeting india can push for such safeguards but it will have to rally support in her favour.googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display(""adslotnativevideo""); });china, a booming economy which is a huge exporter in comparison of india, will not help as the trade deficit between the two countries is very big. according to the data released by general administrative customs (gac) it was $46.56 billion in 2016-17 which show how unevenly balanced the equation is. china is also keen to be able to export its manufactured products on zero tariff basis to india under rcep; a move that new delhi has resisted thus far.there is little hope from countries like singapore, japan, south korea and australia in this regard as these countries would like to safeguard the interests of their investor companies. japan is the third biggest investor in india after mauritius and singapore. south korea is at 14th position and china falls at 17th slot.
